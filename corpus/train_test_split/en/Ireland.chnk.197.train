The Fund has committed in excess of # 400 million which has triggered an investment of # 1.2 billion creating 38 000 jobs for 150 projects right across the border countries and Northern Ireland . #% The measures included in this report will also ensure that polluters face similar requirements , and penalties , right across the European Union . #% Some people today have mentioned women 's rights within Iraq . #% Making producers responsible for their own brand products will lead to improvements of design and have a direct effect on the costs . #% The situation is critical , they need our protection now . #% The budget is inadequate . #% I would like this House to urge the participants to please come together and hold those elections as soon as feasible . #% It provides for the development of common actions in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters while preserving Member State responsibility for maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal securities . #% Let us agree on this report and then make changes in other areas as they come before us . #% We can not continue to maltreat - indeed , crucify - people who have held to the political process , who have tried to maintain peace at all costs , political activity at all costs and to hold violence at bay . #% However , this progress was short lived , as the newly elected Head of State was assassinated and this triggered yet another massacre . #% Even though I do not subcribe to all the proposals put forward by the rapporteur , I personally believe that he has come up with a very balanced approach towards resolving the problem . #% They are also concerned about the greed of many of the sporting organizations involved here . #% Human rights abuses have increased , not diminished . #% I have no hesitation in saying that promotional campaigns by banks and other lending agencies are contributing in a major way to inflationary house prices , thus putting housing outside the affordability of young people wishing to set up their first home . #% These were approved unanimously in the Legal Affairs Committee . #% However , some still see this as a specific sector rather than as a reflection of our society ' s failure to give opportunity for all . #% In my country 6 000 people died in 1997 as a direct consequence of smoking . #% Mr President , the main thrust of this directive is to set targets for the levels of ozone which will be permitted in ambient air within the European Union . #% We then debated a proposed position for Parliament , which was voted on in this Chamber . #% The action proposed by the White Paper involves rebalancing the different modes of transport ; developing high quality rail services ; promoting short sea crossings ; inland waterways and combined transport ; and promoting fair competition between the sectors . #% What is a fact , and what surprises many people , is that because of the level of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere , we are already committed to a significant amount of global warming and rising sea levels . #% It is an affront to and an assault upon both . #% I woke up one morning to find that Irish soldiers were being sent to the Rapid Reaction Force . #% Commissioner Fischler contends that his decoupling proposals will reduce production and therefore increase prices , but this ignores the reality of the Commission 's World Trade proposals of a decrease of up to 36 % in import tariffs amongst other multilateral issues . #% We talk about democracy and transparency . #% The current diet of misinformation and distorted facts must cease . #% We owe it to industry , to small and medium-sized enterprises and individual inventors to provide a simple , affordable Community patent which in turn will help EU innovation and competitiveness . #% The adoption of this legislation constitutes a major step in ensuring equal treatment to third-country nationals across the territory of the EU . #% GNP would be a much fairer criterion . #% They use public procurement , without blushing , to encourage their space sector . #% It is important that this House shows solidarity to those people . #% While the proposal aims to maximise the economic yield of a fishery , and also maintain the capacity of the stock to produce maximum sustainable returns in the long-term , I fear that , far from reducing the levels of discarded catch , critical flaws in the model may cause over-exploitation , as the underlying assumptions used for calculating levels of catch are based on single-species , shallow-water fisheries and do not take account of geographic and biological diversity . #% I can not understand how the Council or anybody else could be surprised . #% As Mr van Dam said , there is a tremendous problem , there is tremendous concern and we have to ensure the future of cod for the future of fishermen . #% We have avoided putting a figure on those resources , but the Commission should commit a specific amount of resources to ensure that this matter is dealt with effectively and that it is possible to work with the relevant organisations and with the people on the ground who either depend on bushmeat for income or for protein to survive . #% I accept that several entries that are currently in Annex IIa will have to be removed from it in the light of recent jurisprudence . #% Mr President , in recent days my small country of Northern Ireland has lost its most prodigious sporting talent ever . #% Enlargement in the right circumstances will guarantee the benefits of the Treaties for new members . #% Only a few kilograms of separated plutonium are needed to build a crude nuclear explosive device . #% Mr President , the Heads of State and Government have set an ambitious target in trying to find agreement on the Agenda 2000 package at the March summit . #% The solution to the suffering and repression in Burma is not primarily about aid , although aid is required to relieve suffering . #% Looking at the positive side , yesterday we saw where Parliament can respond . #% Terrorism deliberately sets out to destroy freedom : its purpose is to destroy freedom . #% The partnership approach involving all European governments and all the institutions in order to develop and formulate key EU policies must always be preserved . #% There is no excuse for us ; we know where benzenes and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons come from . #% Consumer protection must have absolute priority in all measures regarding food safety . #% Could you outline when people will know whether their area will receive less , or more , funding under the reclassification ? #% However , as far as our experience with the International Criminal Court is concerned , it is not yet opportune to start dismantling the current protections that exist under the United Nations Charter . #% It is vitally important that we support Mr De Rossa 's opinion with regard to greater employee participation and consultation in the areas of mergers and developments . #% Securing budgetary discipline strengthens price stability and creates conditions which are conducive to creating much needed employment within the territories of the Union . #% There is also another generation of children on the other side of the border who are too terrified to go to school in case the bus they are riding in is blown up . #% There is fraud at every level of government at which I have served - local , national and European and regional . #% The Greek Government has supported recent peace efforts in the Middle East . #% I hope the President will inform us of the reasons for the allocation of these contracts and the savings made . #% What is so very different about EU textiles as to lead to what appears to be a very prudent approach by the Commission , rather than the swift and fair approach of the US ? #% Likewise the United States must exercise its enormous influence on Israel to cease its assassinations and abuses of human rights in the occupied territories . #% `` The Commission apparatus which wielded excessive power even under President Santer has now become even more powerful ; moreover it is all too often dominated by coteries '' . #% I am fortunate to live in one of the most beautiful places in the Union , namely West Cork in Ireland . #% While Northern Ireland may be a very small place compared to other European areas , we need and require railways in Northern Ireland as well . #% However , as a follow-up to what he has already stated , does the presidency feel that the operation of the Compensation Commission on Iraq , which is based in Geneva , should continue ? #% Madam President , firstly , I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur , Leo Tindemans . #% We wish to indicate our vote that this legal remedy should have a place in European law . #% I believe , with the good will and support of all concerned , China can make the same progress on human rights issues and we want to encourage it to do that . #% It is to say the least disappointing , that some Member States were prepared to conceal the real incidence of BSE in their national herds and equally unwilling to implement the control measures proposed by the Commission and agreed by this Parliament . #% I have absolutely no interest other than the convenience of Members . #% 
Before I welcome this proposal , I wish to see removed the ambiguity that has arisen in the wake of the remarks made by the British Defence Secretary , Geoffrey Hoon , namely is it a Franco-British force or an EU force ? #% We need to be honest in terms of what we are looking for . #% Can she say what information she has , and can she make this information available to us , with regard to the level of development in the different subregions of the country ? #% In some other experiences I have had with the Commission 's external offices I sometimes felt that they can get too close to the local political administration and are somewhat reluctant to take a strong stance on policy and political issues . #% The single currency will be another step . #% The Union for Europe Group , of which I am a member , initiated a peace mission last week to Angola . #% Given that , is there any real reason not to include Malta in the first wave ? #% Mr President , I want to raise the Irish Ferries shipping company 's plans to replace over 500 employees with low-paid slave labour provided by agency workers , many from outside the European Union . #% They sustain environmental sustainability . #% My analogy with particular types of political movements was an attempt to reinforce my argument that this Parliament and this House in particular must abide by the balance of powers and the different competencies attributed to the different institutions in the European Union . #% Mr President , with a heart and a half I forgive you ! #% They have been causing pollution for such a long , long time the length of our coast by polluting the Irish Sea and putting the public in Ireland , and indeed on the west coast of the United Kingdom , at serious risk . #% The people of Ireland are fed up with pious assurances from BNFL and the British government about safety standards at Sellafield . #% Regions have a right to exploit and protect such specialities for their own economic benefit . #% It is an issue of vital importance to organic farmers and their customers and to all stakeholders . #% Secondly , where incentives are given to entrepreneurs and to businesses to invest in new jobs , in new infrastructure and in research and development , giving a longer-lasting guarantee to the creation of manufacturing in other service jobs . #% Therefore , we support what is in the agreement but will not be voting for amendments to the joint resolution . #% You advised us to contact the sub-editor of the Irish newspaper concerned . #% As a senior British trade union general secretary said , it is a significant step forward and offers a chance to build a substantial foundation . #% In addition , the public in general is anxious to know how the original cost compares to the final cost ? #% The new plan is likely to allow more industrial companies to shop around freely for competing sources of gas . #% Drug trafficking remains a massive problem and the illegal trade in small arms , whose main recipients are terrorists and criminals , is estimated to account for 10 % of the global trade in arms . #% The 8 000 net jobs which we gained last year , our best year ever , will not solve the problem in Holland or the UK . #% Mr President , as others have done , I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced . #% We must sit where these people sit , we must recognise the circumstances that they are in , and we must do everything in our power to seek to help them in their dire plight . #% I do believe that the European Social Fund has played a key role in this regard in the past and must continue to do so . #% I believe that in this way Europe can make real added value and move towards its goals of the Lisbon Process . #% Any analysis of the evolution of the CFSP would regrettably have to conclude that the Maastricht Treaty sacrificed political integration to ensure economic integration and , as a consequence , undermine the EU 's potential to be a major foreign policy player on the world stage . #% It would bring home very strongly the idea that there is a benefit to being a European and being part of the European process . #% The PPE appear to have weakened their support for these areas and are abandoning them by omitting them from the priorities of the text . #% While I am not familiar with the situation in other European countries , I know that in Ireland we do not have an adequate number of inspectors and monitors to ensure the health and safety of our own workers . #% By voting for the amendments , then going to conciliation on issues such as the patenting of human embryos and provision for a proper ethics committee , as Mr White has just pointed out , we would see the advances we want in medicine and agriculture but with the various safeguards built in . #% I would remind her that in the 170 years of monetary union with Britain we made less progress than in the 17 years of monetary agreement with the countries of the European Union . #% We must prune the tree in order to allow growth . #% The public must always be given a choice when it comes to news dissemination . #% Ireland is currently 25 % in excess of its targets and yet , a couple of months ago , the then Minister of Finance announced that he was abandoning a commitment to introduce a carbon tax . #% We should make the creating of a job the most attractive thing that anybody with any sense of entrepreneurship can do . #% Animal welfare organisations have been contacting my office and welcoming the law . #% Let us focus on education , let us work together for the common good . #% Indeed , they have been able to tailor insurance provision to the socio-economic characteristics of populations in an informal economy which remain excluded from formal schemes and commercial insurance , and , as a result , they are an appropriate solution for achieving the goal of universal coverage in low - and middle-income countries . #% I would like you to come back and tell us what reply I can give to the people who have written to me . #% We have to take on board the challenges that come before us and we have to ensure that we have a very highly established rail link . #% Remarkably , no VAT is levied on most financial services . #% This House and the spring summit have been ignored . #% I would also like to clear up a misconception . #% Sugar has other uses besides sweets . #% Mr President , this debate again confirms Parliament 's commitment to public health and indeed to environmental issues as well , and I welcome the opportunity to make a brief intervention . #% Even though I know there are rigorous tests and standards as to whether or not an extension would be granted , it should only be granted in the most exceptional circumstances and not for any willy-nilly ideology . #% I would argue that the list of possible functions is by no means exhaustive , and its accountability could also be ensured if it were required to produce an annual report and if its officers regularly appeared before the Parliament ' s Environment , Public Health Consumer Policy and Committee . #% Yes , you will get there , but I seriously question whether this is a method that we should even contemplate at this stage . #% I fear that if beef is allowed to take over the Florence Summit it will augur very badly for a successful summit in Dublin . #% My party is committed to this goal and will work with other parties in a constructive and positive way to achieve this . #% This is a staggering level of violence and hatred by any standards . #% Good luck Commissioner . #% She has not been seen for many days , in fact since the end of May , when it was reported that up to 70 people were killed by the junta army and that she suffered a head injury . #% Nonetheless , I warmly welcome the British Presidency 's commitment to getting Europol established and its interest in promoting international efforts to tackle the illegal drugs business . #% I believe that the creation of an integrated framework and tighter coordination in the field of social security is an important part of our progress towards achieving the social dimension and social protection incorporated in the Lisbon process . #% The EU 's humanitarian policy is the practical expression of its commitment to supporting people in need of assistance when they are at their most vulnerable . #% There is cause for grave concern . #% What has been totally unacceptable is the reported anti-French hysteria , in particular that attributed to the Washington Government establishment . #% The report assesses the current developments in the areas of institutional development , the rule of law , human rights , the economy , environment and EU-Hong Kong cooperation . #% That could have been any ten days in those sorry four years . #% Labour MEPs are voting for this report as it backs the reform process , but we do not support any calls to weaken the proposals adopted by Basel . #% Moreover , the MDGs have to be seen from a development-enabling perspective , while at the same time facing and tackling the root causes of poverty . #% However , the bulk of the trade is made up of mammals , usually weighing more than one kilogram . #% We need emergency fostering in Romania and we need the European Union to push for that . #% 
This summit did not meet the standard set by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety of this Parliament and by civil society around the world , which have called for no less than EUR 30 billion to be pledged by the EU and , crucially , for a firm commitment that this would be new and additional to existing overseas development aid . #% I urge the Commission to continue dialogue with Nigeria under the Cotonou Agreement , to examine the root causes of this conflict and to give every assistance necessary to ensure that these atrocities are not repeated . #% The EU is the world 's biggest aid donor and is responsible for 55 % of all development aid . #% They offer citizens a point of information that is centrally and visibly located in their own Member State . #% I hope that you and your colleagues will be vigilant in ensuring that we have the opportunity to maintain that diversity , as it adds to what essentially the core of Europe is all about . #% All MEPs want a fair statute because it is an albatross around our neck and when they play this opportunist politics , it will be seized upon by the press , in my own country and other countries , to lambast Parliament . #% What consistency is there at the heart of this policy followed by the Commission ? #% It is important to redress the imbalances of the past . #% I would like to take it further and have a social evaluation of the money we spend , to find out whether or not we contribute to the improvement of the economic and social situation of certain regions in Spain or France , where this money is supposed to go , or whether in fact we just give a licence to a small number of people , who control quite a lot of capital , to exploit the waters of a country which is in no position to control its own resources . #% The fishermen will not find a regime legitimate unless they are able to make a contribution and their voice is heard . #% The EU 15 will not meet their current Kyoto targets on CO2 emissions reduction and nothing will be done about that . #% I urge the authorities to ensure that this investigation is absolutely open and transparent and involves UN experts and , if possible , Egyptian human rights organisations . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for that response . #% Having said that , I believe very strongly that we need to harmonise legal procedures so that we can offer a safe haven to those many people seeking refuge in the Community and also so as to have a humane and caring reception procedure that is uniform throughout the Community . #% Only last weekend I read in the Irish media that the head of the Commission 's Environment DG , Mr Curry , complained to Ireland 's EU Ambassador , Mr Denis O'Leary , last autumn that the Irish authorities were not cooperating adequately with Brussels on environmental issues . #% I recently received correspondence from a dairy farmer in County Westmeath , whose herd of prized dairy cows has been all but obliterated since he first discovered TB on his farm less than a year ago . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - I too want to thank Mr Schwab , and my colleagues in other political groups as well , for the considerable amount of work they have put into this report . #% No Member State on its own can effectively resolve the problems of air traffic control or safety in the air . #% I look forward to further details of this plan and hope that it can form the basis for meaningful negotiations . #% However , increased bioenergy production would provide a very positive boost to the farming community , and I believe investment in small-scale biofuel projects within the primary agricultural sector would be extremely beneficial . #% The proposed EN 1384 standard is a compromise which does not provide the best possible protection available , as required by the personnel protective equipment directive . #% Many speakers this morning have spoken about their concerns in relation to the desperate situation in the Middle East . #% What will happen to the system today that is geared into decommissioning fishing boats when we no longer receive Objective 1 funds ? #% Finally , on the argument about militarisation : as a Irishman it makes me sick in the pit of my stomach to listen to lectures from Mr Adams and other people in Sinn Féin who today still maintain an armed ceasefire in Northern Ireland , who refuse to decommission weapons , and who , prior to their entry into a peace process , sullied the name of Irishmen through a campaign of murder and terror for three decades . #% Madam President , on behalf of the Liberal Group , I would like to say to Klaus Hänsch , as his twoand-a-half year term of office comes towards and end , that we believe that he has conducted the business of this House firmly but with great fairness . #% As I will not have the opportunity to do so later on in the debate , I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to all those in New Orleans and elsewhere in the United States who have lost relatives , friends , and indeed belongings , as a result of the catastrophe following Hurricane Katrina . #% The battle to defeat the scourge of trafficking in human beings must be tackled at European Union level in a coordinated and structured manner . #% Sometimes it is national authorities who are actually flouting the law and behaving in an utterly negligent way . #% What we need to do - and I think this has started to happen since my report during the last Parliamentary term - is to put agriculture and food centre stage . #% I have personally gone round to both Members and visitors to ask them to put out their cigarettes . #% I find the President-in-Office 's remarks quite amazing . #% in writing . - I wish to place on the record the fact that I did not participate in the vote on the individual paragraphs of , and amendments to , the joint resolution . #% I noticed that at conciliation the views concerned were unanimous - and that includes views from Ireland , Portugal , Greece and other countries whose waste network and recycling systems are much less developed than in some countries in the EU . #% Firstly , I wish to see that funding for research projects is maintained after 2012 , and I would support the initiatives which encourage young beekeepers into the apiculture sector . #% On the European arrest warrant I would endorse what Mr MacCormick has said . #% But once the US and its European allies took action , the situation changed dramatically . #% There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes . #% And why do I insist on that ? #% That is why limiting the categories of offences to 32 was a good idea in the initial stage . #% That is particularly apparent when we look at the current difficulties concerning the recognition of the euro and the eurozone economy within the United States and in the Far East , and at the constant questioning concerning the enforcement of the rules concerning the Stability and Growth Pact in those areas . #% When you actually look at the Commission 's approach to the whole issue of fisheries over the last few years , you will see that the Commission in fact used to be the most progressive of the EU institutions , pushing very hard for conservation and reasonable management of fish stocks with , of course , the obvious exception of third-country agreements . #% Finally , I support the inclusion of pension liabilities within the SGP . #% Firstly , there is the enormous increase in the use of X-rays during medical treatment and tests over the past twelve years throughout the European Union ; secondly , the significant progress in scientific knowledge and X-ray technology that has taken place over this time ; thirdly , the number of international organizations that have issued more updated recommendations on X-rays , and fourthly , Article 129 of the Maastricht Treaty , which has given the European Union new powers in public health . #% Ministers actually have to move away from this Luddite position of ignoring scientific advice and take the scientific advice on board . #% I believe this is lawnmower harmonisation at its best , where everything is chopped down to the lowest common denominator . #% Secondly , where we get industrial profits as an additional source of funding for renewable energy , will we see a level playing field across the board ? #% The European Parliament should work closely with the US Congress to stiffen the backbone and resolve both of the European governments and of the current US administration . #% Medication must not be incorporated into feed to be used for animals within one month of slaughter . #% Ireland is today , and effectively always has been , a non-aligned country eager to play its own modest role in protecting peace and security around the globe . #% The US and the WTO will continue to insist that science , not sentiment , and scientific measurement , in particular , be the yardstick which determines food quality and food safety . #% A number of key elements that were mentioned by the Prime Minister in his speech are deserving of more in-depth analysis and comment . #% The negotiations which have begun on Agenda 2000 are among the most important ever to be undertaken by the Union . #% Could I raise an issue in advance of Question Time next week . #% It has become well documented that if people do not start smoking before the age of 18 the chances are that they will not become smokers at all in later life . #% He is serious about making a difference in combating trafficking , and that needs to be recognised . #% Concerning diversification , not all those leaving farming and/or rural dwellers are entrepreneurs , or interested in being so . #% As many speakers have already said , coming up to the Employment Summit , it is one of the key areas where Parliament could at last have its voice heard by the Council and the Heads of Government . #% This is the sort of lie they tell : ' If you took the measures that are necessary we would live in a life of dimming lights , turning off air conditioning , sacrificing our industrial competitiveness and curtailing our economic growth ' . #% Surely you are aware that we expressed serious criticism of the Election Commission and its lack of independence ? #% Mr President , the comments of Mr Crowley are a disgrace to this House ! #% Here again we hope that , in working through the programme for January , where these overlaps arise they will be explicitly identified and addressed in order that potential conflicts in spheres of responsibility should not slow down the reform process . #% We in this Chamber are often criticised for not being radical enough in our opinions and our viewpoints . #% Clearly , 11 September virtually wiped out that business . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her excellent work in this area . #% . Mr President , I am pleased and relieved to have an opportunity to speak in favour of the joint resolution . #% I will be urging it to adopt such a position as this directive is not a first step in the right direction , but in fact a giant leap backwards . #% 
In conclusion , the rights of each Member State and each person who lives in Europe must be guaranteed . #% We have made mistakes at European level with our negative reaction to the election of the Hamas Government in Palestine , which sent out the wrong signal , allowing radical groups to take control on the ground and leading people to say ` There is no point in voting for these people or bringing these people in because the Europeans will cut off the money ' . #% Such a centre would serve to create a more proactive approach to medium and longer-term industrial change which would benefit all those concerned - Commission , European Parliament , social partners , government and local authorities . #% My own peripheral region has received only 10 % of all EU funding to Ireland over the past 30 years and is therefore still seriously under-developed in terms of infrastructure . #% This is a far cry from a scientific endorsement of increasing European fishing of octopus even if certain other fleets have reduced their effort . #% Can I say in general terms , that we are all very concerned about employment , but the reality is that we do not do what we should do . #% We need to send a clear message with this report that , while EU membership is achievable , it will require significant and sustained commitment to reform . #% Mr President , I should like to discuss the report from the point of view of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on behalf of which I drew up an opinion . #% In particular I would like to thank the Germans for not only pushing ahead for progress in peace concerning Kosovo , but peace on the issues concerning Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , I want to add my voice to those Members calling for the swift passage of this legislation through Parliament . #% It aims to rationalise , strengthen and update the legislation governing the importation into the Community of wild and domestic animals susceptible to either FMD or CSF . #% But this touches on something of a very fundamental political nature , and merely technical responses to a record which shows a difference in votes may not be enough . #% Mr President , I would like to raise an urgent matter concerning the operations of a Turkish-owned bank in the Netherlands known as Finansbank . #% Clearly , however , SOLVIT needs more resources and support , and needs to promote itself and its availability to the public . #% I think only Sweden and Denmark have exceeded that , and the average European State produces something like 0.3 % , so we have arrived at half the ideal objective . #% However , I would put it to the Council that , particularly in the course of this Presidency , much of the credibility around that rhetoric has been undermined . #% Some of that debate unfortunately centred around the common agricultural policy . #% We also strongly support the protection of human rights and we are always strengthening legislation to protect the environment . #% There are still people harking back to the days when , as an Irish poet said : `` every rood of ground maintained its man '' . #% The Commission must strictly manage the animal welfare provisions and ensure that they are respected throughout the European Union for animals imported and exported . #% Drugs are a commodity and are being traded on the open market in our towns and cities . #% The important role that the Petitions Committee plays is of course at the other side of that equation , where we seek to ensure that national governments and local authorities comply with European law in the interests of the citizen . #% In a debate yesterday on the situation in Iraq , a deeply respected French colleague said that it was hardly the time to lay blame when men , women and children were dying in this tragic war . #% This was not an isolated incident . #% I believe it is difficult to say that there is no danger or threat there , without some sort of monitoring and assessment of the situation . #% Many of the amendments adopted in committee would place the European agriculture industry at a considerable disadvantage vis-à-vis our trading partners , not to mention running the risk of falling foul of our WTO commitments . #% This identifies the weaknesses in the policies where we have a quota system and at the same time require vast Community resources to subsidise surpluses . #% The definition of a food supplement in the directive should reflect all supplements . #% Mr President , I want to concentrate on the need to tackle the growing phenomenon of child abuse on the Internet . #% GM citizenship may be for some ; it is not for me . #% In conclusion , you can have all the regulation in the world , but if there is not a committed individual watching and guiding for all the Member States , it will amount to nothing . #% I must remind the House and members of the Convention that the Convention is a consultative process - the real decisions should and must be made by the Council of Ministers . #% I apologise most profusely for that . #% The Common Agricultural Policy has been a European success story , and we want to keep it that way . #% We should bear in mind , as the Commissioner has pointed out , that it has taken two and a half years to get to this point through negotiations with five presidencies . #% I am also very concerned about reports on the hours that these cabin crew work and the consequent fatigue they suffer with no breaks allowed between shifts and 25 minute turnaround time during which they are required to carry out cleaning duties . #% Monetary union requires this level of flexibility , so that more internal market competition can be stimulated . #% If a Member State is willing and progressive enough to take more stringent measures then surely it should be allowed to do that . #% We know that recent Treaties , including the Amsterdam and Nice Treaties , have imperfections . #% I hope and believe you would similarly defend any Member . #% Many times when we speak about the issues involved , in spite of our best efforts , some of us would like to see new things added to what has already been agreed . #% It gives exclusive prominence to the freedom to provide services across borders , whereas freedoms such as social rights and collective bargaining are excluded or dismantled . #% Mr President , if we support the social dimension of the European Union , we must give it practical expression by giving priority to the protection of the health and safety of workers . #% It is also losing significant state contracts , which enabled it to maintain its public service obligations , because of the public procurement requirements . #% On this area I think it is worth pointing out that the excise tax on mineral oils is tried and tested in all of our fiscal regimes . #% If the President can confirm this , I think it is not a bad performance and shows that we are coming to terms with the problem . #% There is nothing unusual about parliamentarians visiting this prisoner . #% The power that we have in Parliament , which we share as the Union 's budgetary authority , is perhaps the greatest responsibility that we have . #% But in micro-economic terms at the level of the salmon industry consider the implications of Norway , a state outside the Union which produces a massive surplus for export - and has the potential to produce much more in the immediate future - and floods our market to such an extent that the anti-dumping case when it is examined will hold . #% The horrors of Algeria and the lack of response from the government in Algeria to an independent human rights Commission to visit Algeria to see what is happening there is something that should also be raised . #% We have a Union where we not only cooperate as states but we also share our sovereignty and our law-making in the best interests of ourselves as individual Member States and the total population of the European Union . #% The question is : have you the will to do better , or is all the talk mere platitudes and empty words ? #% There is a role for economic policy coordination , but it must be applied in a sensible and balanced manner in all Member States . #% Can Council confirm that this is so and , if not , what proposals does it have to include children in Maastricht Two as a matter of urgency , so that there is a basis for common action ? #% I also contacted the journalist involved yesterday and I told him that there were inaccuracies and I followed it up with a letter of which you can have a copy . #% I would argue , in total contrast to what Mrs Foster says , that an EU coastguard could effectively police EU waters : it could clamp down on illegal dumping , enforce the common fisheries policy , assist with emergency rescue services and restrict illegal trafficking . #% The ELDR Group is strongly committed to achieving EMU in line with the Treaty criteria and timetable , but there remains space for real policy debate . #% The Sixth Framework Programme is the first implementation of the European Research Area , which itself is a consequence of the Lisbon Summit and its wish for us to have a successful knowledge-based economy , because of the strong correlation between research and development and economic success - inadequate in most EU countries outside Scandinavia , I should say . #% These proposals provide for basic norms in three key areas : the authority responsible for determining the receivability of the asylum applications , the independent institution to which the asylum seekers can resort to re-examine their application and the appeal procedure . #% He rightly spoke about the importance of the Doha Round and the impact that will have , not just within Europe but around the globe , on increasing trade and also on delivering on aspects of social justice , though not a comprehensive package of social justice . #% Finally , we must play a greater and clearer role as regards the place within society of those with disabilities . #% There is sure to be another outbreak of an exotic disease - if not foot and mouth - with the movement of people and animals and modern travel today . #% I am convinced that the national regulatory authorities will significantly contribute to the development of the internal market and create fair competitive conditions . #% If we had good statistics , we would be able to deal with a problem like that before it arose . #% We want to be able to talk to you and engage with you on the question of suitability for the portfolios and to understand the capacities that you bring to this prospect . #% I fully support the conclusions by my colleague Richard Howitt and his call for a unified EU human rights report identifying an annual list of countries of particular concern , a sliding scale of sanctions against abuser countries , removing the national veto for their agreement , implementing the human rights and democracy clause in the EU 's international agreements and introducing human rights impact assessments for EU actions abroad . #% 
If we decide to transfer responsibility for agricultural industry from the Member States to the European Union and discharge that responsibility more efficiently , the end result could in fact be a reduction in the burden of taxation . #% I fully support my colleague Mr Trakatellis 's approach . #% We must ask why . #% We had hoped that we would get away with it unscathed but it shows just how dangerous and highly contagious this disease is , through the way animals move . #% Harassing and interrogating Members at the doorways coming into this House are against the rules . #% Madam President , as regards fishing in international waters we need a responsible and non-exploitative approach . #% Mr President , as we debate the revision of targets set in the 1994 packaging directive , in an effort to reduce the EU 's growing mountain of packaging waste , I would like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Corbey and the shadow rapporteur Mrs Ayuso González , for their hard work in this very important area . #% We are politicians ; we want to decide it ourselves . #% I therefore question whether a further assault on State aid is justified in pursuit of the failing Lisbon Agenda . #% Thirdly , within the context of cohesion funding , talk of territorial cohesion in my region is somewhat ironic , since we were excluded from cohesion funding from its inception , while our neighbour in the Irish Republic was included . #% It should also underline the importance of positive measures to assist developing countries to develop their institutional capacity to monitor compliance with core labour standards and to increase the educational opportunities available to children . ' #% To this end , we do not tar all the outgoing Commission with the same brush . #% I would refer you to those statistics - I am sure you know what they are , and we have to do better . #% They must put forward a common strategy which recognises and responds to the clearly established demands of our European citizens for action against drugs and crime . #% I have been a Member of this Parliament since 1989 . #% I think it is ridiculous that somebody who is elected by the body of the Parliament - by the individual Members here within the Parliament - can have their office terminated by a decision of the Conference of Presidents . #% Could I add to that the name of one young man born and raised in Ireland , Tristan James Murray , whose mother comes from my part of Ireland in Wexford , and his Colombian colleague , Javier Nova , young environmentalists missing since July . #% But your credibility is somewhat questioned by the fact that our President , Mr Gil-Robles , is not invited to the meeting this afternoon . #% We want to see all industrialised countries take urgent action to reduce or limit future greenhouse gas emissions . #% However , I want to reiterate what Mr Poettering and others have said : we must not in any way believe that all Arabs are terrorists . #% The most important aspects of improving the service relate , in my opinion , to the training of personnel , as well as clear and coherent guidelines for operators across the sector . #% But would the President-in-Office share my concerns that growth rates do not appear to be converting into forecasted increases in employment rates ? #% The men and women involved in the inshore fisheries sector are calling on you to consider a new Community approach . #% We recommend an examination of the use of living wills across European borders , which are so badly needed . #% It will in fact do damage from a health education point of view , as nutrient profiles are solely based on the composition of a food or food category and do not take into consideration the consumption of the food or food category or consumers ' individual habits . #% This is something which will appeal to the public . #% This not only undermines the founding principles of NEPAD and the ACP-EU relationship , but also means that major problems burdening Africa -- external debt , AIDS , food security , conflict prevention , good governance and human rights -- can not be properly addressed . #% Anything less would be damaging to the public interest and no less damaging to the ultimate sustainability of a proper public service capacity within the Union . #% That is the type of breakdown we need in every area of injury if we are going to save lives . #% However , these European Union Treaties guarantee that the Union can operate effectively for the time being . #% Freezing the budget level in practice means diverting money from the CAP and the Structural and Cohesion Funds into Eastern Europe . #% The fact is that some 30 000 patents for computer-implemented inventions have been handed out by the European Patent Office and indeed national patent offices . #% The European Union showed real leadership , supported to a large extent by the candidate countries , the G77 and China . #% The Lisbon challenge is to delineate policy and methods for redressing these deficiencies and to release this potential dynamic . #% I co-signed this resolution on breast cancer as I believe the European Union can do much to assist Member States in this area through extensive research , benchmarking and sharing of best-practice principles , as well as offering Member States substantial professional , material and technical assistance through European programmes . #% If that is taken out of the calculation , the rate of fraud and error , as best we can make it out , is about 1 % . #% With all due respect to the oratorical elegance and linguistic ability of the President of the Commission , and all of my colleagues within the groups here in Parliament , I would be useless speaking to a German audience with regard to what Europe does for them . #% We need to look at the people who vote for these parties , and understand why this situation arises . #% Fish are migratory : they do not stay in one place all the time , year after year . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Herzog on an excellent report . #% This is an integrated approach which I hope to address in a later question by another Member of the House . #% I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation . #% Mr President , I too have companies in my constituency that are benefiting from this public procurement regime . #% We had the possibility for large amounts of fraud and racketeering through the payment of monetary compensatory amounts . #% It is a privilege for me to be part of a process that can begin to ensure that this protection is provided . #% Controversial areas such as biotechnology must , in my view , be part of this equation . #% I also firmly believe that if the authority is to have the confidence and backing of the people of Europe , it is imperative that it operates and communicates in a wholly transparent and independent manner , dedicated to the assessment of food-safety risk . #% in writing . - The common agricultural policy ( CAP ) has the potential to offer solutions to many of the problems currently affecting European farms , and this is obvious in no EU Member State more than in Ireland , where there is an equal commitment to both secure a fair and full CAP agreement and to move forward by implementing the changes necessary in 21st century farming . #% It is their votes that really matter . #% I feel we can not welcome an Australian proposal which is no longer an Australian proposal on this particular issue . #% With the adoption of this package , business and SMEs will find it easier , as Mr Stubb said , to sell their products - common household goods , bicycles , ladders , tanks , containers etc. - while consumers should reap the benefit of a wider choice of high-quality and safe products . #% So Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority . #% While I appreciate that Britain will not be one of these countries , it is nonetheless important that all countries , even those not participating in the single currency from day one , should be actively involved in the preparatory and planning phases for the launch of the euro because of the potential impact of this currency on all our economies , whether inside or outside the single currency zone . #% The economic and social situations of the EU ' s peripheral and island regions vary considerably . #% I recall that the Nice Council before Christmas set out a number of guidelines for new social policy measures . #% In fact it was one of the first major flashpoints when I joined Parliament in 1984 , yet we still have not reached a satisfactory conclusion . #% I have three messages for the Commission at WTO level . #% I stress this is only the beginning of a process of stricter and more rigorous financial control and accountability . #% In some countries , an NGO can be formed with a membership of less than five people . #% in writing . - I wish to express support for this report and its recommendations . #% We have to listen and allow them to make the decisions , we should not make decisions for them . #% It is short but its brevity belies its significance . #% DCI has formalised structures , recognising the important function that Parliament should play in its role as overseer and adviser . #% The bringing together of the data in their intelligence banks and policy strategy is of imperative value to them in their fight against terrorism . #% It is our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union , to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament . #% She had not intended the interpretation which has been made and I would appreciate it if this could be noted in the record of the House . #% 
Human rights lawyers have been assassinated as well by loyalist paramilitaries . #% The European Commission has brought forward a proposal which is designed to establish a new European Maritime Safety Agency . #% They certainly are a mechanism but we must make sure that they do not have other unwanted effects . #% I have no doubt but that we , in Parliament , will give them the strongest possible support in their pursuit of justice . #% In Ireland some junior doctors work over 100 hours per week , the average being 70 to 80 . #% The sooner we , as a world community , wake up to this reality , the less will be the need to produce and to adopt the crisis-management measures that we are debating and , hopefully , adopting today . #% The elimination of transaction costs and the lowering of interest rates is good news . #% Vacancies in Ireland , for example , include : accounts assistants , building administrators and sales and reservations . #% in writing . - I support this report which focuses on the various aspects of direct and indirect discrimination towards women and men who are responsible for taking care of dependents . #% The more accurate and reliable the information provided is , then the better our environmental policies will be . #% In conclusion , my Group supports the compromise and tabled the full set of amendments involved . #% This is an enforcement directive and one that can not write IP law . #% There is a lot of mythology about what is safe and what is not safe . #% The vessels being built must support local industry and local coastal fishing . #% Now we all accept that fishing activity must be limited in line with declining resources , but the Commission 's proposals are unfair and contradictory . #% Whilst I voted in favour of the report , I must confess to having some disquiet with regard to two aspects contained within it . #% I regret the present unsatisfactory state of fish stocks in relation to technical conservation measures . #% The European Community is optimally positioned to combat transnational health problems , such as the threat posed by epidemics of infectious diseases and food-related incidences . #% That , concretely , is the prescription of the Commission . #% As has been said , Ireland relies very heavily on landfill - I think only Greece is more reliant . #% I and members of my core team also briefed heads of mission in Islamabad on a weekly basis . #% In the light of the failure of the Irish authorities to comply with EU directives , particularly in relation to waste , is there any possibility that the Commission might consider sending in an independent team to investigate the damage that is being done and the irregularities present in relation to waste in this area in particular ? #% Naturally we have the interest of European producers and consumers in higher food quality , rural development , environment protection and animal welfare . #% Unfortunately , when we arrived in Lisbon , our visas were cancelled by the Angolan Ambassador to Portugal . #% Farmers in this sector are feeling the crisis quite acutely , as their costs are rising and the price of pigmeat is falling . #% Since I am responsible to the Committee on Budgetary Control for animal products , I felt it my duty to insert that amendment . #% in writing . - It is extremely important that the EU takes action and becomes a world leader in reducing carbon emissions approaching the Copenhagen Summit . #% I believe the convention method open to the Member States , national parliaments , the Commission and perhaps ideally also to candidate states can provide a very good framework - not necessarily a single-choice menu , but a framework of rational and consistent choices - and an Intergovernmental Conference can then be invited to proceed . #% The reason for Mr Hyland asking this question , and why I am taking it on his behalf , is that over the last few years we have seen more and more young people becoming disconnected from political and civil life . #% You have remarked yourself , Prime Minister , that there is too little risk capital available on European capital markets . #% The bigger EU States like France , Germany and the United Kingdom traded about 30 % of GDP in the 1960s as against 60 % today , but they enjoyed much faster economic growth at that time than they do now . #% Despite all the difficulties , what has actually been achieved in both those countries in the last 12 to 13 years is phenomenal : the change of culture , the change of attitude , the willingness to engage , the openness and transparency . #% The tormented victims of brutal terrorism are largely forgotten . #% We particularly oppose the adoption of the directive under which Member States may , inter alia , adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period . #% However , it is clear from his own report that BNFL can not be trusted . #% In view of the world-wide demand for seafood , it is increasingly important as a raw material supplier to the fish processing sector , with a significant added value and export opportunities . #% Iraq deserves better than the Commission reply . #% I can see the benefits of introducing tax incentives to motorists to purchase vehicles with reduced CO2 emissions and improved fuel efficiency . #% Many of the difficult conditions as laid out by the EU/IMF programme are necessary if we are to restore healthy public finances . #% We want the implementation of commitments in the White Paper on renewable energies , for example . #% They have allowed thousands of illegal dumps right across Europe , including in Ireland . #% In Amendment No 19 there is a call for harmonisation of penalties . #% The budget will have to be increased significantly if the existing common policies are to continue to operate effectively in an enlarged Union . #% We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80 % of these resources are spent by the Member States . #% 25 % of the EU 's and Ireland 's population experience at least one significant episode of mental ill health during their lives . #% Let me conclude by warmly thanking the Irish presidency for the courtesy it has extended to the Groups of this Parliament and to Parliament itself and for taking on board the concerns of this Parliament . #% This has put us all in a very difficult position , because we who are supporters of social dialogue , of protecting the rights of workers and of increasing the opportunities for employment of all the peoples in Europe want to ensure the best possible conditions for those most in need . #% Madam President , Indonesia is an area of the world that has been criticized many times in this Parliament , particularly because of East Timor . #% It is estimated by the British Government that in households where children 's viewing includes a large number of programmes targeted at adults as well as at children and young people , children would see 41 % fewer adverts of food and drink products that are high in fat , salt and sugar . #% The global economic crisis , coupled with major shifts in world trade , has made many workers redundant in Ireland and across Europe . #% Commissioner Rehn reported this evening that it has succeeded in reducing the cost of doing business by 22 % in some areas and will continue to concentrate on this initiative . #% The major achievement of the Irish presidency was to secure agreement on a Treaty that establishes a Constitution for Europe but , allied to this , a key priority was to communicate Europe better to its citizens . #% We all want to find cures for illness and I am sure that in each of our families we have personally experienced the sadness of incurable disease . #% Now that the EU petition has been tabled with the WTO , I plead with the Commission to defend vigorously the vital interests of European and , indeed , Irish agriculture . #% I am aware of the rule which states that the President ' s ruling on votes shall be final . #% I , too , want to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report on the Commission 's second annual report on the demographic situation in the European Union . #% The citizens of that state do not have equal rights . #% The European Council is going to ask the European Commission to develop a broader communications strategy . #% Both the Republic and the North of Ireland seek to continue the derogation agreed in December 1999 , because of geographic and geopolitical reasons . #% With regard to the issue of terrorism , it has been correctly emphasised here that intelligence is the key to defeating terrorism . #% The utmost respect must be paid to the need for social , economic and regional cohesion , and the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of those regions that are highly dependent on fisheries . #% They are not confined merely to Belgium but exist throughout the European Union and much of the developing world . #% You touched on it yourself , Prime Minister , during your own questions concerning economics and other areas . #% In that time I have dealt with 12 cases and almost daily requests for information and for help . #% The Commissioner is right in that we should not get carried away excessively by following every poll but when they are so consistent , underneath it there is a message . #% The EU-15 is dependent on Middle East countries for 31 % of oil imports , on Russia for 30 % of gas imports and 28 % of oil imports , and on Algeria for 22 % of gas imports . #% 
No one had conceived of using a fully loaded , large passenger plane as a weapon . #% We do not need any more over-emphasis on this particular position . #% I do not share the rapporteur 's recommendations relating to the common agricultural policy and I can not support his suggestion to introduce co-financing of the CAP . #% Since this time Irish Equitable Life policyholders have lost their investment , which in many cases means their life savings . #% It is very important that Mrs Müller 's request be voted on by the House . #% But the third came with the thumbprint of Government on it , unlike this request , so it is an inadequate precedent , even if it is a modest step in that direction . #% In the procedures to date , many of the nominee Commissioners were kind enough to , in effect , promise in advance a charter of reform for their own areas and have alluded to specific policy commitments . #% 17 % of all expenditure carried out on improving our roads , water treatment and transport networks under our capital programme originates from the European regional cohesion funds . #% Those are the matters which really concern the fishermen of Northern Ireland . #% My one big criticism of the destruct scheme is that it did not particularly insist that Member States with a problem targeted the older cow , where the real risk cohort still remained . #% Commissioner , considering the huge scale of citizenship granted over recent years in Bulgaria to immigrants from Moldova , Ukraine , Russia and elsewhere , what realistic steps will be taken to control that immigration by proxy through Bulgaria and Romania ? #% It allows us all to bring our best experience to addressing the issues which we all want to address , being the Millennium Development Goals and the needs of very poor people in a suffering part of the world . #% So I accept the principle as reasonable , but when fishermen from a particular region go to exploit these resources , in some instances we should consider whether we should rebalance the resources within our own waters . #% Ireland achieves about 98 % compliance with the current Directive , but it is clear that not enough is being done to ensure proper standards in water quality , and environmental standards generally . #% The European Union works at its best when Parliament , the Commission and the Council are working closely together on the implementation of various EU regulations and directives . #% The Commission must come up with appropriate negotiation proposals . #% It is also important to try to correct the situation where things have gone wrong , but in so doing not to exaggerate it in such a way as to create in the European public 's mind an image of a European Union that is out of control , that is a sea of corruption and can not be trusted with taxpayers ' money . #% The aspect of employment in all sectors of the fishing industry needs to be reviewed . #% The draft treaty is marked by both ambition and realism and is a credit to its main author , Mr Noel Dorr . #% The negative micro-management spiral has to be avoided and the common fisheries policy needs to be fundamentally altered , as the discard issue seriously discredits it . #% I welcome the articulation of ten guiding principles which focus on the needs and requirements of SMEs and aim to help them realise their full market potential . #% We must be concerned about the human problems that arise out of the squeeze-out of excessive labour , but at the same time , we should remember that the cost of food has been reduced . #% I am glad that the overwhelming vote here this morning was in favour of the joint resolution which was drawn up and approved by representatives of all the major political groups . #% Mr President , I want to welcome Mr Söderman this morning and to congratulate Mrs Lambert and Mrs Thors for their reports . #% in writing . - While recreational angling constitutes just a small catch percentage of Europe 's fishing industry , it is an integral economic and social element of many parts of the EU , particularly Ireland East . #% I think it is timely after the security experience gained in the aftermath of September 11th that basic principles can be legally set in stone as to what has to be done in order to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference . #% I believe that there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect all interests . #% The whole area of innovation , research and development is one that we talk about a lot , but in which concrete legislative action to protect design , patents and copyright , and to allow for proper investment in research and development , in financial terms , is still lacking . #% In discussing this matter , we should not create the feeling - which some people have done and have been trying to do - that , in some way or another , the European Union 's treasury is a more leaky vessel than those of the Member States or similar treasuries throughout the world . #% We need to reduce amounts of waste in landfill and incineration . #% Mr President , with regard to the speakers to whom you have given the floor during this debate , I object to the lack of balance among the different Member States . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I wholeheartedly support this question to the Commission from each of the three committees on what I regard as a most important topic . #% Thank you very much for the invitation . #% There should be more structural assistance for technological development instead of heavy infrastructures in the less-favoured regions , especially in the Objective 1 regions . #% All new EU legislation must be subjected to strict tests for its impact on enterprise and competitiveness . #% It would be a good idea by the way if we did something in our new buildings to do with renewable energy . #% They still do not get the levels of support , independence and protection they need . #% She has not made the usual mistake of condemning the whole system . #% A new treaty can not be agreed unless some political flexibility enters the political process . #% We should fight within the European Union because individual States have failed . #% In particular , a panel of experts to scrutinise finances will provide for ongoing rather than retrospective scrutiny allowing a rapid response to any irregularities . #% I thank the President-in-Office for that comprehensive reply . #% We need an EU that allows local and regional democracy to flourish and which respects the sovereignty of Member States and their people . #% The Union must orientate its activities to initiatives such as this if it is to respond to the needs and issues of concern to its citizens . #% Can I say that we fully understand the wish of the Commission and Council to ensure the success of the telecom package in advance of the Laeken Summit . #% According to Kurlansky , the Encyclopaedia of Commerce and Navigation printed in New York in 1858 said that the codfish was a species so well-known that there was no need to explain anything about it , that it was extraordinarily prolific and that someone had counted the eggs of a middling-sized codfish and found that there were 9 835 000 eggs . #% At times , the pressure on Parliament to cave in , to divide , to give up our legislative role , was barely tolerable . #% They skipped bail -- partly put up , it is said , by the Dublin Government -- and now , on the back of a sordid deal with the IRA , and despite Interpol warrants for the three men , they are brazenly flaunting themselves in Dublin . #% In conclusion , I will be supporting Mrs Smet 's report on the basis that the procedure does not seek to harmonise policies or converge policies , but facilitates compatibility , facilitates flexibility and encourages dissemination of best practices and exchanges of ideas . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mr Wynn , all the rapporteurs and Mrs Theato and to say that they are a group of people dedicated to the whole business of getting the Community 's finances in order . #% Increasing crude oil prices are having a detrimental effect on the European economy and are likely to impede our chances of attaining the Lisbon objectives of high quality full employment . #% The international coalition - particularly the United States and not least its President - has assumed that the Northern Alliance is in some ways biddable , that it will do certain things and not others . #% I welcome the fact that the present regional aid guidelines , as they affect my constituency of Northern Ireland , are a marked improvement from earlier drafts , and that the Commission has listened to representations from myself and others . #% Unfortunately this government has had many friends in this Parliament over the years and many EU governments have put the profits of their arms industries above those of the basic human rights of the unfortunate people of East Timor . #% Our role in supporting Northern Ireland has been a major success . #% I am despondent that the European Union has been so impotent in its efforts at seeking to stop this war and to achieve a peaceful disarmament of the Iraqis . #% Enlargement with the current restrictions on our budget would be disastrous for the new Member States and would also destroy much of the success in achieving economic and social cohesion between the existing 15 Member States . #% Its institutions are not imitations : they are unique institutions reflecting unique arrangements of Member States , intergovernmentalism , cooperation , coordination and -- despite what some colleagues may say -- democracy . #% No details were given on the types of arms that would be exported , their value , or the decisions that would likely be taken regarding the other 44 licences . #% It is rather disturbing that we had the Swedish Prime Minister , coming here yesterday urging a `` yes '' vote . #% I am glad to have the opportunity to explain my amendment . #% One of the issues which the honourable Member raises is the question of the Essen strategy which included , incidentally , a report on local initiatives and the contribution they can make . #% With respect to the neutral countries , some of the wording in this resolution is extremely ambiguous in relation to collective defence . #% We should keep control of legislative decisions in this political arena -- even if it means conciliation it is still political control -- rather than letting the courts decide on legislation for us . #% An ILO mission in February was denied access to Aung San Suu Kyi , and the UN Special Envoy strongly criticised the slow progress of dialogue . #% As the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases , owing to their high global warming potential -- GWP -- came to be recognised as a major contributor -- up to 5 % and rising -- to the greenhouse effect . #% 
Like many people , I too , Madam President , was disappointed that the recent Middle East peace talks in Camp David did not culminate in a peace settlement between the Palestinians and the Israeli Government . #% I hope that colleagues will support this resolution and vote with us on it . #% So we will vote against this amendment and in favour of the original recital . #% If it is not removed our great movement will come to a halt because any one Member State can say : thus far and no further . #% On the matter of implementation : Carrying suitcases from summit to summit does nothing . #% For example , today there were 226 in the first vote after the issue of the quorum was raised . #% Certain countries need to apply rules differently : if , for example , a country is an island , or does not have a population to support a large , functioning market , it needs to use every advantage at its disposal to attract investment . #% Following our government 's announcement last night of a new multi-party national forum to explain and discuss the European project in general and Nice in particular , I hope a more informed , reassured Irish electorate will allow our government to ratify the Nice Treaty in the next twelve months or so . #% Finally , can I say that over the past 24 hours I have asked the services of the House to conduct , on my behalf , their own investigation into this question of documentation at a committee meeting earlier this week . #% I would appeal to Members of this House not to pull the plug on an important measure of economic reform . #% Stereotyping of women is much more dangerous than stereotyping of men . #% I am very satisfied that the Finnish Government intends to pursue this matter vigorously over the next six months . #% Also , in the area of private financing for the health service , there must be a risk equalisation element whereby , if you bring in a private health insurer for the health care system , they must take the same risk as existing insurers or the state , which means covering everyone and all sections of society . #% I would refer you also to the fact - I have said this in other fora - that Director-General Lamoureux has made statements on nuclear energy which vastly exceed the brief of the Commission . #% It contained many difficult dossiers and many difficult ideas which many people in industry , in particular , were opposed to but also , uniquely , which a lot of people involved in trade unions were against as well . #% But , even when the profits flooded in , the Lisbon strategy , as our leaders chose to understand it , remained an excuse -- a kind of mantra -- to spend the new and plentiful money on anything but the people who needed it most . #% For example , the Italians have successfully moved into overseas markets , based on their strength and customer service , and they have actually avoided competing head-on with low cost imports . #% He has demonstrated , yet again , that it is quality and vision that count in the construction of Europe . #% As Mr Ford also pointed out , Michael Courtney made a valuable contribution to the current peace process in Burundi and I would hope there will be a full inquiry into his death which will bring those responsible for his death to justice . #% Where a consolidated approach means that the prior approval of all 25 Member States is necessary when formulating domestic fiscal policy ? #% Open Recruitment and Portability of Grants , #% But I realize that a problem exists . #% It is also desirable that the composition of the EU team should not only draw upon youthful idealism and enthusiasm but should also have considerable depth and wealth of experience . #% Under this directive , draconian regulations have been imposed on Northern Ireland . #% More recently the EU Commission took the first step towards legal action against Ireland for inadequate monitoring and control of water pollution from agricultural sources . #% Again , I am assured by the Commission that this matter is now being addressed , and it is likely that legal proceedings will be discontinued . #% Moreover it is not just companies . #% It is quite clear that nuclear power can never be the least cost option and the least cost option must be adopted under the memorandum of understanding . #% Let us not forget that this is not just about those two countries living up to commitments that they made to us under the Copenhagen criteria and under their accession agreements . #% The Council 's 2005 report on human rights is a good summary of human rights activity and aspirations within the EU and the impact that such activity is having outside the Union . #% It is now high time that our policies assisted that agriculture . #% It is a sensible position in helping us to work with business and consumers that we can ensure that court action is only the last resort and we can find better ways to resolve disputes . #% EU Member States need to consider ways in which we could harmonise our laws to exchange or compile registers of serious sex offenders . #% I support the Commission 's assessment that the EU has an overall health situation and health care system that are among the best in the world . #% The time has come when this House must face up to the fact that the fishermen from the North and the South of Ireland , for the first time in history , have come together to face this particular problem . #% I share the concern of the rapporteur over the fact that seven of the fourteen Essen projects are still facing difficulties because their funding is not totally guaranteed and no timetables have been drawn up for their implementation . #% Even if some countries in the developed world are not pulling their weight on this score , I believe that the EU and other like-minded countries should , nevertheless , work for more ambitious action in this area . #% Judging from the keen interest in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , Members are aware that in our very midst people with mental illness are being subjected to the inhuman abuses of involuntary institutionalisation and hospitalisation , compulsory drugging and other medical treatments , physical restraint and force , while also being subject to discrimination in the workplace , exclusion in the community and suspicion on the part of public services . #% Under strict interpretation of the decision which the minister referred to , they would then be entitled to sell duty-free goods on the boat at that particular time . #% The safety and security at the Sellafield plant is as much a matter of concern for the European Union as it is for the Irish and British governments . #% I suppose it is very easy with hindsight to talk about what could or should have been done or what we did not do , but now , with the benefit of that hindsight , we could put mechanisms in place to ensure that this never happens again . #% Indeed , unemployment rates are much higher in some Member States . #% I call on the EU and its Member States to honour the political decision made and to provide this mission with more troops and appropriate financial , logistic and air support , including the necessary number of helicopters , as soon as possible . #% I accept that ; we can not carry the entire burden we have been asked to carry at once . #% However , the Internal Market Committee insists that all legislative proposals be accompanied by a quality impact assessment , a summary and a better regulation checklist on internal market proposals . #% There should be an agreed dispute-resolution mechanism available at local level , which can reduce the cost of settling consumer disputes because , as has been pointed out by many speakers this evening , there is the question of added costs with regard to resolution of disputes . #% The financial task force run by the OECD will be broadened to cover the issue of combating money laundering . #% Madam President , my group voted for the Watson report , which is an excellent and very comprehensive one . #% In terms of creating a fair trading system , the EU has made a significant contribution with its ` everything but arms ' initiative . #% Would he not agree with me that the hype being put forward in the media about intensive farming/factory farming has nothing to do with all this ? #% Do they also imbibe the cultures that they are there to control ? #% At the top of the list were the United States , Canada and then the UK . #% It has been totally counterproductive and every effort will be made in future to prevent similar intrusions . #% There is a proper balanced way to achieve the rights that everybody here wants to see . #% That is the essential point I was making . #% As well , we will always remember you as a person with a good sense of humour . #% One of the most important areas we need to look at is how best we can create a society in which people are protected from the dangers presented to them . #% What we are looking for is more consultation , more interaction . #% I think that if we want to speak about real debate and real engagement then that debate and that engagement must be based upon facts , certainties , not the continuous misconception , myth and innuendo that have been cast about over the last 20 years . #% We should be wearing them every day for the victims of these killer diseases . #% These high standards must not put them at a disadvantage in comparison to third country competitors . #% I am also pleased to note that the Irish Government is most diligent in seeking clarification on the results of the bilateral meetings which took place at the end of the last presidency . #% May your enthusiasm not wane for the next two-and-a-half years and may it prove to be infectious as you represent us throughout Europe and indeed further afield . #% It is basically only a political promise . #% There will be no verdict during our debate on anything that General Pinochet may or may not have done . #% We have come a long way , over a long number of years , in trying to change the view that nationalism in Ireland has of itself . #% 
Maybe the Commission will tell us how they will get out of the dilemma now that they are clearly out of touch with people . #% There was no heavy equipment when we were there yesterday . #% My mother died a month ago . #% The Commission has expressed concern over recent years about the IMF 's macro-economic framework for low income countries . #% But if I choose to spend my leisure time taking excess exposure to the sun , then go into the workplace on a Monday , say , and I am working on a construction site , or in the fields , in a vineyard , at a sports venue , beside a swimming pool or wherever , and I am already overexposed through lack of personal responsibility at the weekend , is it my employer 's duty to ensure that I should not have any extra exposure to the sun on the Monday ? #% Madam President , it is clear that the real objective here is the removal of the Indonesians from the occupied territory of East Timor and the East Timorese right to self-determination . #% That is not the right way forward . #% If that happens , it is the consumers who will be the losers in the end . #% Would it like more information about this study ? #% Why do we not deal with this subject as a whole ? #% We welcome his efforts in this respect . #% You have demonstrated the potential in the world of a small , vibrant and - I remind you - still neutral nation . #% It has established a coordination group to ensure the prompt and effective implementation at political level of decisions concerning all elements of the relationship between Canada and the European Union . #% A lot is riding on that and failure would have disastrous consequences for the region as a whole and for Europe . #% Principle number two is institutions that respect differences . #% What are you going to do about it ? #% Approximately 500 women commit suicide in China every day , and yet the report does not say one word about China 's ` one child ' policy , which denies women the right to make real choices in their lives . #% It is hypocritical , on public interest grounds , for a Member State to prevent other EU online operators from entering a national market , while at the same time allowing its own national online market to grow considerably while not applying those public interest rules . #% We must now consolidate the good will there is , secure agreement with regard to the bottom-line issues and try very hard to strike a deal before 17 June for the new European Treaty . #% Whatever we feel about the rights or wrongs of the conflict in Iraq , the most important thing to do now - and I congratulate the Greek Presidency on trying to achieve a consensus on this - is to bring all of Europe together with regard to humanitarian aid , facilitating the rebuilding of Iraq and ensuring that its people have the right tools to make their own decisions . #% With regard to specific events of recent weeks , I believe that any mention of financially reprimanding Ireland , which is being suggested in some quarters , would be a highly regressive step . #% The Ulster Unionist Party has received so much support from this House time and time again , and at the same time , in the European Parliament , we have the Referendum Party propping up a single Member with # 150 , 000 for the general election campaign in Britain . #% This is a very welcome report for those of us who have worked in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media on this issue . #% So why are we so unable to make headway in this part of the world ? #% I have lobbied for genuine refugees in my own country , largely unsuccessfully . #% I want it to go ahead , but I want to reassure people that adequate measures are being taken at European and national levels to ensure that the SARS virus does not spread . #% At that meeting the Members of the European Civil Aviation Council ( ECAC ) present were told by their legal advisor that they could not proceed under the ICAO Agreement as requested by Airbus and so Airbus persuaded the Commission to legislate where ECAC could not . #% While broadly supporting the guarantee fund , it must be stressed that the success of the fund will depend on certain key tenets being addressed in its structure . #% That not only means improving safety standards of production within the Union but also tightening up rules and conditions for the importation of food products into the Union . #% There should be some visible EU presence . #% It is also important that when we decide to bring in new programmes , we ensure that the voluntary sector and the non-governmental organisations who are working at the coalface , who are there with women 's and children 's refuges to help them , are brought in at the very earliest stage to advise us of what is the most effective way of utilising funding . #% It is also time that the obstacles to the implementation of the Mitchell report were removed . #% In the interests of all industries that rely on the coast we have to take action , and take it now . #% It is unbelievable that it wants its personnel to be free from prosecution if they are involved in human rights breaches . #% If we are now going to insist on country of origin for mince , why can not we have country of origin for the larger pieces of beef from 1 September , or whenever ? #% There has also been increased rigour in the reporting of BSE and increased surveillance generally with new testing regimes . #% Therefore , we need to vote on Amendment No 206 . #% Mr President , the Guellec report does not impress me , for three reasons . #% Similarly , in the case of butter , only 75 % of the butter we produce is sold at market prices . #% On 18 May , there will be protests around the world organised by many groups , including the Tamil Solidarity Campaign , to mark the second anniversary of this bloody war . #% I think that the message this Parliament will give today by voting through these new measures is that we want goods to move freely , we want to increase competition and consumer choice , but we will not compromise on safety and , therefore , we have stepped up enforcement surveillance and given the CE mark the legal protection it deserves , to ensure that importers and manufacturers can be legally prosecuted if they fail in their duty of responsibility to protect the consumer . #% I have considerable sympathy for the workers at BNFL let down by a sloppy management . #% I urge the Irish Government to act swiftly to ensure that these resources are promptly and effectively used to meet the workers ' individual retraining and educational needs . #% We must ensure that support is put in place to allow people to remain in their families and their local communities as much as possible . #% Many scientists dispute this and recommend more research with adult stem cells to achieve the same results in curing diseases . #% Let us at least show the next generation that there is more to life than some of the books that are being produced and sold in all our airports . #% Having said that I support the thrust of what is before us here today and the ability of the Commission to use as a carrot-and-stick approach the Structural Funds to encourage in perhaps the most effective way recalcitrant Member States such as Ireland , to get their house in order in relation to the Natura 2000 sites . #% Talk , goodwill and interest are not enough ; we need serious financial and regulatory catalysts to increase research and roll out the development of pilot projects using cutting-edge renewable technologies . #% There are many Member States within the European Union which are not involved in the arms industry and do not want to be involved in the arms industry . #% His experience at the highest political levels over the years in matters European renders his views particularly important . #% The European Union delegation was given a kick in the face by the Israelis by not being allowed to meet with the necessary parties to try to start a dialogue and bring it around . #% In conclusion , can I say that I am very pleased that the President has , this morning , referred to fisheries . #% I hope it will be made clear to everybody at all times that the concessions expected from us in the World Trade Organisation negotiations have been made and that we will not offer the prospect of any more concessions to the farmers of Europe until the present seven years have expired . #% It looks at the figures and it comes to its conclusion that everything does not fit together and that it can not give discharge . #% I have my criticisms of the Treaty of Nice , but it is important that we be brave enough to say , `` Of course , we have problems , but it is important that the enlargement process gets under way '' . #% We must recall that the Treaties of the European Union incorporated judicial cooperation in civil matters in 1993 . #% Yes , gender equality is one of the major values the EU stands for and it would be very helpful , in selling the new Constitutional Treaty , if we stressed that it is reinforced in the Treaty . #% Thirdly , it sets a very bad precedent if every time an agreement collapses or problems entirely foreseeable arise , we decide to dish out huge sums of European taxpayers ' money . #% It is discourteous to Members and interrupts the debates . #% We have already seen this when dealing with the Services Directive over the last six years , where even now we are only at second reading . #% The cost of both air travel and ferry links has been kept at a low level , partly because of the EU-imposed competition between airlines and between car ferries and partly because of the cross-subsidizing of transport costs through duty-free sales . #% But is it right that European taxpayers ' money should be going into something like this when people all over Europe are crying out for essential social needs ? #% The Commission is certainly aware of the speed and efficiency with which this proposal was dealt with in Parliament . #% No Member of this House can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many Iraqi people find themselves . #% The Commission 's original proposal provided for a derogation whereby the design right could no longer be invoked against such use after a period of three years . #% I come from a Member State which benefits from European funding but I am appalled at its track record on the implementation of the wild birds directive , on the habitats directive and many other directives . #% 
The purpose of the Spring Council was clear at the outset : it was to be an economic forum , an opportunity to review the stage we had reached and also to chart out a new way for the future , in particular by looking again at the Lisbon strategy and establishing what alterations had to be made for us to continue to move towards that target . #% President-in-Office , why did an Irish presidency choose to initiate diplomatic relations with the military dictatorship in Burma ? #% The warlords still maintain their iron grip outside Kabul and women still wear the burka and have no rights whatsoever , for instance to education or primary healthcare . #% It is essential that subsidiarity prevail and that each Member State be free to decide which medicines will require prescriptions . #% Let 's be frank about it ; many of the Member States have or are facing economic collapse . #% In their response , I note that the Commission has already launched a public consultation and has held hearings to exchange views with stakeholders . #% Women have to be two or three times better than men if they are to get anywhere , to actually achieve anything . #% This is a diplomatic issue and one that must be raised urgently . #% I have to say , with the greatest of respect for France and her people , that to load the mission so much towards France verges on the provocative , and I think it deeply unwise . #% It is much better for the international community to invest in peace now rather than having to spend money later picking up the pieces caused by continued conflict and violence . #% I can assure him that he is unlikely to get the kind of shock that other rapporteurs have received the night before or on the day of the vote on the human rights report . #% I call on the Commission and the United Kingdom Government - because in the past they have not shown themselves to be prepared to put up the matching funding - this time to put their money where their mouth is and make sure they give support to these communities . #% Mr President , I am the co-rapporteur for the excise report on mineral oils . #% The plain truth is also that the EU has failed the textile industry . #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to say that I welcome the Commission 's publication of the new telecom directives and regulations on 12 July . #% I am not satisfied that the Commissioner has given a full reply to all the questions . #% We are all aware of the difficulties that the international community has had with the Iranian Government concerning its compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . #% Most importantly , the only by-products which should end up in animal feed , and consequently the food chain , are those by-products which would be fit for direct human consumption . #% The best way for us to present this to the people of Europe is to say that yes , we have hit a bump on the road , but this is not the end of the European project . #% Mr President , There are many things on which Mr von Habsburg and I would not agree . #% Will it interfere with the rights of people who are unhappy with the status quo and want to change things ? #% From an Irish perspective , we view the proposal very positively . #% I know many colleagues agree with me that in future we should work as a European Union and have European Community schemes rather than attempting to latch on to schemes developed elsewhere , in the United States for example . #% I would warn against complacency . #% If this is the way Council and the Fisheries Committee are going to continue they are basically proving correct the cynics and all those who said that the reform of the common fisheries policy was not going to see any achievable result in relation to sustainable fishing . #% It is also crucial that we adopt a qualitative , value-for-money approach with the resources that we have . #% We have also sadly witnessed many tragedies in recent times , as persons seeking to enter the European Union have died in awful circumstances . #% My primary concern today is to ensure that the channels of communication , which seem to be opening for the first time since the onset of the Limet tragedy , are strengthened and that progress can be made to return the children to their home as soon as possible . #% Political lessons should be learnt from this , but they must take second place to Europe offering whatever aid is needed and whatever aid is requested by the United States to assist the people concerned . #% I can not emphasise strongly enough that this is unacceptable behaviour and that the relevant Commissioner is well aware of our views . #% The idea is that cross-border shoppers can contact this address if they have problems . #% I call upon the Irish Government to make this a priority for its presidency of the European Union . #% Mr President , violence has brought neither greater freedom to the Palestinian people , nor greater security for the Israeli people . #% Can he assure the House that whatever is agreed in relation to the reform of Europe 's common agricultural policy will be fully protected in those negotiations , because otherwise the entire negotiating process would be meaningless ? #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I would like to welcome President Barroso and the Members of the Commission to the Chamber . #% Unless we create sustainable employment at regional level and , in the context of this report , employment suitable for women , then the economic and social viability of rural communities will be put at further risk . #% Let us , as responsible public representatives , try to present the truth to our people instead of trying to mislead them and excite them and frighten them . #% It was disappointing that Ireland did not receive an appropriate share out of the additional milk quota despite the commitments that were given to Ireland in 1983 . #% From this , however , some good could come . #% However , Mozambique is Ireland 's biggest destination for development aid money and the reason is that the Irish Government works very closely with the Clinton Foundation in tackling disease , including AIDS , as well as giving education on the ground . #% It is about time that the Commission had the courage to present that report and its scientific findings to Parliament so that we can deal with that particular matter . #% in writing . - I support this report which extends eligibility of housing interventions in marginalised communities to the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) . #% The amendments aim to protect the principles of non-commercialisation of the human body and its parts through voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells , to prohibit all interventions in the human germline which could be passed on to future generations and to ensure that no material from human-animal hybrid embryos or chimeras would be used in research . #% By 2025 , 2 billion more people will be on this planet , 90 % of them born into the Third World . #% We need an equivalent of the Euratom Treaty for renewable energy . #% One oft-quoted example of such a bad patent is Amazon 's ` one-click ' shopping method . #% However , due to dubious and complex ` fine print ' , theses schemes then proceed to harass people for money in an extremely threatening and malicious manner . #% Madam President , if we are ill , health is our most desired object . #% If the Council insists there is a limit , we have to insist that it is 1.27 % . #% We have continued to make it clear to the Turkish authorities that observance of the rule of law and basic liberties is the basis of continued rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey . #% That is demonstrably false . #% Mr Titley is out of step with his own Foreign Minister who said that he wanted to clean up the UK 's international arms export reputation . #% I would like to assure the Members of the House that the refugees are fully aware of , and greatly value and appreciate , the earlier efforts of the European Parliament in drawing attention to their situation . #% In any case , the UK and Ireland will persist as centres of excellence for nonconventional medicine . #% It is imperative that the protection of the health of our citizens is our only priority and that all decisions will be based on the best scientific evidence available . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Hyland for his report . #% This is an integral part of the overall strategy to implement the Lisbon process , so as to guarantee that the European Union becomes the most competitive economy in the world by 2010 . #% Firstly , conditions do not change at all for the animals . #% Mr President , can I first of all apologise to you , your predecessor and the House for my late arrival . #% Next week , I will be travelling to the Hague conference , where the special commission will meet to review the practical operation of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction . #% A second point I would like to raise is the question of the European Union and the coordination of our aid policies and our foreign policies . #% We must all seek to restore Iraq to the international community under an indigenous and representative government . #% We have to ask ourselves what the European Union wants to achieve in reforming of the common fisheries policy . #% If we do , it will not happen by accident . #% In relation to the PNR issue , it is extremely important that citizens have the right to data protection . #% The governance of this historic city must be removed from any nationalistic or sectarian , in the best sense of that word , spirit and this governance must provide for equal access and rule for all . #% 
I take it that his is the correct one , that we are about selfsufficient since the Nordic countries joined . #% - I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said . #% That charted the way forward in terms of bringing about peace and stability not only between Israel and Palestine , but also amongst their neighbours , including Syria , Jordan , Iran , Egypt and Lebanon . #% Have they actually done so ? #% Any family with more than three children , or families with grandparents or other household members , are dependent on bigger cars like people carriers and therefore will be forced to pay the consequences . #% The people appear in certain areas to have resolved to take the law into their own hands in an effort to protect their own children and go beyond the law in some cases . #% I welcome , therefore , the Commission ' s confirmation of my understanding that enlargement can proceed without the ratification of the Nice Treaty . #% Perhaps without Israel 's cooperation the only lawful and effective solution for the EU , short of suspending the agreement , is for the Member States to hold in doubt the origin of virtually all Israeli exports . #% Businesses need to be clear about the standards and practices they must aspire to in order to be able to deliver on this directive . #% There have been some hopeful signs of movement this week from other EU Member States , following Ireland 's appeal for this mission to be adequately resourced . #% I strongly oppose this proposal . #% In all the frayed work to alleviate the suffering and chaos , clear leadership and coordinated assistance are needed . #% What are the subsequent steps planned by the Commission in this area ? #% The mudflat at Stregrennan , which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission , has been completely destroyed at this stage . #% The European Union needs to address this issue . #% In its review both the social and environment legs of the Lisbon Strategy have been demoted in favour of an EU brand of competitiveness . #% Unfortunately , there are still tens of thousands of children who have AK-47s put into their hands and are sent out to war to kill other people . #% It is essential that SMEs are given as much support as possible to play their part in the economic recovery , yet what do they currently face ? #% We should not forget that Al Capone was eventually imprisoned for tax evasion . #% The Chinese must understand that the continuation of nuclear testing is incompatible with implementation of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty . #% Nowhere has this opportunity been more ignored than in the processing of wool . #% They will do so because it will contribute to improving fish stocks . #% Mr President , regarding the order of business I should like to put on the official record my congratulations to my constituency colleague and good friend , Mr Cox , on his election as president of the ELDR group . #% In this debate I will restrict my comments to the issue of coherence and the linkage between regional policy and competition policy . #% It has already completed 22 of its 31 chapters of accession to the European Union . #% Each of us has focused on different priorities and , in many ways , we have ceased to understand each other 's concerns . #% This is a very urgent matter and deserves to be debated as a matter of urgency , because it is a threat to the free market . #% This Parliament also has to ensure that Member State governments stop supplying arms to Indonesia until democracy is established there . #% I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date . #% This attitude of risking the future of the fledgling democracies and emerging economies of central and eastern Europe has fed the eurosceptic vein in Ireland and is reflective of a government which would rather play short-term national political games for the sake of a few votes in an upcoming general election . #% I also welcome the recently submitted draft plan for the police structure reform as it lays down a balanced allocation of responsibilities at all levels , while ensuring transparency in selection of police chiefs and officers and for monitoring their work . #% The question is : can the Commission take an initiative which breathes life and operational content into the aspirations of Article 191 ? #% The parliaments of ACP countries should press for their involvement in the adoption and execution of the country and regional strategy papers , as these are the main programming tools for development assistance . #% I have heard the word ` democracy ' repeated many times in Parliament and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on which I sit . #% The CFP has become a bureaucratic nightmare with over regulation and micro-management plaguing the industry while achieving little in the way of positive outcomes . #% Mr President , this directive underlines the seriousness of our intent to come to terms with greenhouse gases . #% This is an important policy objective because it will ensure that on entry these countries can participate within the Union in a competitive climate . #% I have asked that this be communicated to the chairman of the Intergovernmental Group and the matter is being examined . #% I want to assure the honourable Member that the presidency will do everything it can to advance the sympathies expressed in his question . #% Even at this late stage it is better we know the problems than adopt a head-in-the-sand approach . #% Where we have measures in place to try to encourage young people into farming , we must ensure that they are sufficient to do just that . #% We have made a very good start : we have seen many ministers visiting parliamentary committees and political groups already , and this has been much appreciated . #% The proposal to reduce export subsidies is both misplaced and ill judged , especially since it is aimed at forcing a policy decision , mainly a reduction in the transport of live animals . #% We need to look at the social and economic contribution we make to developing countries , and in relation to fishing agreements this leaves a lot to be desired . #% Another fourth-generation conference must be called immediately to come up with the necessities to protect our troops in the field so that they can go about their important job of protecting refugees . #% On the pyrotechnics proposal we are conducting an impact assessment on amendments proposed by our rapporteur . #% According to a recent OECD survey , the substance has a similar structure and toxicity to PFOS and thus should be phased out accordingly . #% The Commissioner is probably aware that the Irish rail system is run by a state company in which the government is a shareholder . #% Most Member States question the Commission 's approach in making substantial reduction commitment offers at this stage , given that there will be pressure to make further concessions as negotiations proceed . #% I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report . #% To take up the point made by Mr Nicholson : why should young people in the Celtic Tiger economy in Ireland remain on the land ? #% Will the Commissioner pledge that he will not seek to allow a system to be put in place that will bestow a second-class service on rural communities ? #% The Commission must also make effective use of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to intensify contacts and cooperation with Iranian civil society and independent media and to support democracy and respect for human rights in Iran . #% Mr President , I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the work that has been carried out on this very difficult matter . #% Many people in the European Union are trying to tackle the issue of landfill sites situated near homes or the fact that incinerators are being planned in some countries , including my own to try to deal with the waste problem . #% The challenge for us as policy-makers is how to increase food production in a sustainable way , how to produce more from less , how to manage our stocks and how to deal with the issue of stock dislocation that the Commissioner has identified . #% Unless we put in place a proper financial model and basis for securing universal pensions for all , the system is bound to fail because of demographics and other priorities that may arise . #% Our now costly emergency plan to restore consumption and consumer confidence calls for 100 % participation by each Member State . #% This is in line with the Council position . #% Some people may say it is not important but most people feel , as we know ourselves in terms of civil rights and terminology , that language really does matter in this area . #% The protection of intellectual property should be one of your concerns . #% I very much welcome the news conveyed to the House by Ms McCarthy of the generosity of the Japanese people in this particular respect . #% That is why we have tabled a number of questions to the Commissioner to assist in further developing and supporting the SOLVIT network . #% The programme seeks to complement , support and monitor the policies of the Member States and to contribute to protecting the health , safety , economic and legal interests of consumers . #% Because of its closer proximity to Ireland than to most parts of the British mainland , the Irish Government has again raised serious objections to the continued operation of this dangerous plant . #% It secures jobs and ensures cooperation with the third world and the Mediterranean in particular . #% 
The decisions will have a direct and immediate effect on the citizens of the Union , whether our farming and fishing communities , those in industry - large and small , rural and urban communities and those who live in the less-developed regions and islands . #% Very often a laugh is no harm in this Chamber , and you have given us a few this evening . #% This will help to guarantee that all air passengers in Europe are kept fully informed as to their legal rights with regard to air travel . #% Madam President , I am very happy to participate at short notice in this debate and to recognize the contribution that Mr Colom i Naval has made by bringing up this particular report , by his contribution at the level of the committee where he analysed very thoroughly what the problem is and proposed sensible solutions , and to thank him for his contribution here this morning . #% We must bear in mind that more modern advanced microchips are being designed with authentication programmes which will be even harder to change fraudulently . #% Finally , the Israelis and the Palestinians must also calm the situation and de-escalate the conflict . #% In order to ensure food safety , the whole food chain must be flawless and its supervision comprehensive . #% I do not want to oppose the Commission proposal , referred to in the Langenhagen report , to allow industrial fishing to continue in this particular case . #% This new Agency will provide Member States of the EU and the European Commission with the necessary technical and scientific support in order to effectively implement Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and to prevent pollution from ships . #% The Taoiseach has certainly intensified the series of bilateral negotiations with other European Union governments with regard to the provisions of a new EU Treaty , but , as the Taoiseach said himself in Strasbourg in January , this is a job one can not do on one 's own . #% We all know that children under three put toys in their mouths . #% The aim is truth in advertising . #% I must emphasize that we certainly support the tenor of this report and consider it to be extremely important in the opinion-forming necessary before the fifth framework programme . #% We have a great density of institutional relations - we have touched on some of them in the debate already . #% It is clear that to date there has been significant over-fishing and in many cases illegal fishing of EU waters . #% It is to be regretted that some people used the debate on food safety to undermine the profession of farming and the role of farmers as guarantors of a quality food supply for citizens . #% Shoppers who choose produce with the Fair Trade mark play a vital role in alleviating poverty and supporting marginalised producers in a manner that promotes dignity and self-sufficiency . #% Social policy must be tailored to the needs of the individual countries . #% That is the nub of the debate on the deeply flawed Services Directive . #% It is completely unacceptable that far-reaching decisions have been taken by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs ministers when there has been no debate in this Parliament on the subject . #% The family recipe , the local flavour , the hand-made product , the quality and unique character need our protection to keep our regions as rich as they are now . #% Less than one-third of Ireland 's trade is with the probable founding countries of EMU , while 70 % of it is with Britain and the rest of the world . #% Maybe we should now examine how we can bring more people into the social dialogue . #% On the one hand , there is no doubt that simplifying the existing vehicle tax system to remove obstacles and distortions to the free circulation of passenger cars within the internal market is long overdue . #% I would also like to acknowledge the great cooperation and support I received from the head of the EU Mission , Mr Ilkka Uusitalo , all the heads of the EU diplomatic mission as well as the government and opposition parties in Sri Lanka and particularly the Elections Commissioner . #% There is , however , a need for continued detailed debate on one issue in particular , a CCCTB . #% That was unfortunate . #% I would just point out one factor alone : that in the new buildings we have in Brussels it is impossible for a person in a wheelchair to move from the B block to the C block or from the B block to the A block , because the passageways are too narrow . #% We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them , but we are choosing not to use them . #% To generate greater sales of Fair Trade terms for the benefit of more marginalised producers , it is important to involve commercial manufacturers and to encourage Fair Trade supply to supermarkets , where most people do their shopping . #% We are conducting a hearing on the impact of public procurement laws on the internal market . #% This is currently something that we should be concerned about . #% However , the timetable for possible accession lies in Turkish hands alone . #% Studies estimate , frighteningly , that by 2020 neuro-psychiatric disorders , with depression at the top of the list , will be the highest-ranking cause of illness in the developed world . #% European leaders , especially the British Government , can help to restore some balance in relations between Britain and the rest of Europe by agreeing on a framework for resolving the BSE problem at the summit . #% There were some controversial proposals in the Rothley report , particularly as regards EU tax . #% It is no good saying , as the US has said to us , that diversification is the answer . #% In sitting down to draw up our long-term plans we should recognise the interests of the Union , its cohesiveness , its solidarity and its influence in the world . #% We need to stop the export refunds granted in relation to third countries for slaughter , irrespective of whether conditions are being complied with or not . #% We must adopt a flexible approach to ensure that Europe can remain competitive in the world market and global market in which we now live . #% Mr President , all I would like to say is to express my deep appreciation to you and to the Members of this House for the welcome they have given today to the members of the Northern Ireland Assembly . #% The British Nuclear Fuel 's vessel named Pacific Swan is rapidly becoming the pariah of South America because the captain intends to negotiate the treacherous waters of Cape Horn with 90 tonnes of waste vitrified in 192 glass blocks . #% I would appeal to the Commission to soften the severity of these proposals and find a better way . #% The underlying basis of all of this , the polluter pays principle , is one that we should be pushing most of all here . #% I believe that a supply of fresh , cheap seafood can be a tremendous tourist attraction in peripheral regions , particularly for areas like Galicia , the west of Ireland and Scotland . #% There was quite a lot of contention at earlier readings on this directive as to whether all donations had to be voluntary or unremunerated . #% There will be broad-ranging representation at this Convention which will afford all participants a time for real reflection as to the direction that the European Union must take in the immediate years ahead . #% Answering Mr Imbeni , he correctly acknowledged and saluted the adjustment efforts made in Italy . #% Mr President , the College of Quaestors seeks to be neutral in terms of expressing political opinions and I can assure you that it will continue to be so . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , for the purposes of accuracy and updating the facts , as regards paragraph 94 , I propose through our oral amendment the addition of the words ` welcomes , however , the resumption of this aid from February 2007 ' . #% I am opposed to the arms industry but we must not put at risk the economic prosperity of Northern Ireland with ill-conceived and badly researched amendments in the European Parliament . #% I often give the example - as I did at a committee meeting this morning - of the survival of the only cotton-weed colony in Ireland in the south-east corner of Wexford . #% We have an entirely different responsibility . #% Remember that it is the farmers who , through a whopping 9.5 % modulation from the single farm payment in 2006 , are going to be key funders . #% I am also directly concerned with the effects of reprocessing on neighbouring states , such as my own , where radioactive contamination from Sellafield has been found on the east coast beaches , in particular Carlingford Lough , where I grew up . #% To put this into context , more people will die in the European Union from the effects of a strain of TB that is drug-resistant than will be affected by avian flu . #% The political reality is that if we do not get a qualified majority for legal base Article 175 tomorrow -- and we need a qualified majority for a second reading -- the common position will remain : the dual legal base . #% The differences in standards have also contributed to public anxieties - consumers wonder why their countries have a different limit to another country . #% In Africa , in 2000 , at least one species of red colobus monkey probably became extinct due to hunting , and many other species are expected to follow shortly . #% There can be no question of our going back , under pressure from the Americans , on any of the commitments we have entered into with our farmers . #% Very often , delays also occur in relation as the report mentions - to the circumstances of the death . #% If we had done that , Mr Wynn 's control and recovery would be less of a problem . #% Commissioner , in your strategy I want you to prioritise tackling the very disturbing growth in child pornography on the Internet . #% The best thing that we can do today in the European Parliament is to encourage Prime Minister Zapatero in his efforts to bring together what were previously irreconcilable peoples to find a common way forward in the Basque region . #% Is that a fair system ? #% I am appalled at Commissioner Byrne who also bent over backwards to help the owner of the , the world 's biggest pelagic trawler , to get that fishing licence . #% 
The worst thing you can say about that settlement is that it was made on a legal basis which was not in effect when the crime was committed , but was in effect while the case was still open . #% The fact that we export over 90 % of our production makes the Irish sector relevant to other Member States and , indeed , it is often said that Ireland 's beef production is Europe 's surplus . #% He is one of the finance ministers who sought to deny this Parliament its democratic right to control the budget of the European Union . #% When the Budgetary Control Committee interviewed Mr Wessberg on 24 May 2011 , MEPs praised his past performance in both the private and public sectors . #% This has to be a benefit in what we call `` rip-off Britain '' , by driving down high prices in our own over-priced internal home market . #% Any attempt to sully the reputation of the IFI is totally unacceptable and amounts to ill-informed political bandwagoning on the sensitivities of Northern Ireland and are not worthy of this Parliament . #% It is inappropriate for Members to try with this resolution to rewrite regulations which were agreed unanimously by this Parliament and will be up for review in 2006 . #% We all know how the average supermarket likes to present itself to the consumer as a ` slasher ' of prices . #% Creating conditions for early Palestinian elections is a key to progress . #% Mr President , I have been provoked by several speakers but I will not be deterred from what I have to say . #% I have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving . #% The House will be aware that my colleague Mr Ashworth 's report on simplification of the CAP was adopted in this House last May . #% In the case of the that vessel was illegal . #% So really we have to bring an end to European tax-payers ' money being used for the cruel and inhumane policy of live exports . #% Sixty per cent of the world 's population lives in rural areas and the vast majority are in developing countries . #% I welcome this directive . #% Air delays in Europe have reached the worse level in nine years . #% It sets standards in environment , it sets goals for research and development , it helps to add something to the global challenge for European industry . #% With regard to the situation of whether or not the people want Europe or Europe , I would never dare to speak on behalf of all the people of Europe . #% Secondly , only some countries would take up the match funding opportunities which might arise in return for EU regulation and competence . #% The activities of nuclear power stations and reprocessing plants have implications that go beyond borders . #% I would just like to finish by saying that the report itself is excellent and I hope that it gets full support . #% There must be flexibility . #% The committee certainly wants to see SOLVIT strengthened . #% Such a slur on our interinstitutional relationship must not be allowed to stand . #% You see what those weapons are doing to the East Timorese people . #% Madam President , can I welcome the forbearance and patience shown by the Commissioner 's staff during the last seven months . #% I would also like to thank Mr Hughes for his efforts . #% I do not need to remind the President-in-Office of how essential it is to meet the timetable , not only to secure the necessary democratic legitimacy for the Agenda 2000 package but also to allow programmes and policies to be implemented in a timely and effective manner . #% In our individual Member States , and collectively as the European Union , we must exert whatever pressure we can to bring the government and FARC back to the negotiating table , under a real ceasefire agreement genuinely observed by all parties to the conflict . #% Again , as we await the ratification of Amsterdam , the same logic applies to institutional reform . #% It is most regrettable that the Council described the situation in this way . #% It contained an element of exclusivity so that if a family could not afford to support a student studying in a foreign country that student could not benefit . #% No one country can tackle this alone . #% Some of our political , religious , juridical and police institutions have been implicated in corrupt collusion with this evil . #% Cartloads of nuclear waste are regularly stored at marshalling yards in Willesden . #% As well as that , from my own experience in Ireland , over the last 10 years the one key element with regard to the solution of conflict and of discrimination and of hatred , is dialogue . #% The Member has quite rightly taken the empathy which we have , as presidency , with the situation she outlines . #% Turning briefly to the content of Mr Linkohr 's report and the way in which we expect that money to be spent - and remember this is co-decision - some of the European Parliament 's priorities are reflected in Mr Linkohr 's report : our wish for landmines to be investigated , for inter-modal transport , educational multimedia and , in particular , renewable energy - and I must make it clear that the Committee on Budgets made it a condition that a proportion of that extra money would be spent on renewable energy . #% The Mitchell principles have clearly laid down the broad parameters for an overall peace agreement . #% To go to Taiwan , Hong Kong or South America once every five years is not sufficient and nobody is fooled by this any longer . #% It is a recipe for a bureaucratic nightmare with zero safety gains . #% Yesterday I left home at 7 o'clock in the morning and , because of the behaviour of Air France at Charles de Gaulle , I arrived here at 9 o'clock yesterday evening . #% How we can allow illegal bombing like this to continue is just beyond credibility . #% The database and information technology exists to establish the necessary communications between national and regional authorities , emergency response experts and the public . #% Could I ask that Commissioner Kyprianou bring this particular piece of legislation to his attention and immediately ` Lisbonproof ' it ? #% The United States is , of course , one of the countries which owes the largest amount of money to the United Nations . #% Many industries in Malta which export a wide variety of semi-manufactured goods are owned by British , French , German and Italian companies . #% That is why I believe that this proposal - which I support - gives hope to the people who live in these remote communities , where no other hope exists for them and no one seems to want to help . #% The EU needs to show its commitment to the Irish people , including the people of Carlow and Kilkenny , by fast-tracking these relief funds . #% Of course those living in or at risk from poverty are hardest hit . #% Belligerence between Spanish and Irish fishermen and the destruction of fishing gear inside the Irish Box have recently been reported . #% It is most important that we do not point the finger of blame at someone else from the Popular Party or from the Socialist Party , but encourage the main forces of democracy in Spain to unite in finding a solution for all of the people of Spain and not to be driven down the road of division and dissension . #% More R [ amp ] D is needed to tailor selectivity devices such as square mesh panels and sorting grids to make them even more effective in protecting young fish . #% The work of the EU Ombudsman brings into focus the wider debate on accountability -- or , more accurately , the lack of accountability -- within the European Union . #% We have seen that there has been market opening in some countries to 100 % of customers , that there has been an unbundling of network operators in all Member States to some extent , but not completely , and there has been a limited increase in clarity and transparency of regulation . #% Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed . #% I have said before that the Euratom Treaty was a very efficient way of promoting nuclear energy , on which we have varied views . #% As a further safeguard , and to assist SMEs , I have proposed an amendment to introduce an online register where any stricter measures that are compatible with the single market under Article 176 would be recorded in an easily accessible single document . #% Finally , we must mount a serious campaign at the United Nations for sanctions against Burma . #% Commissioner , it appears that you have set your face against the retention of duty-free sales . #% I took the floor to say that it is a shame that we can not now deal with the two items on duty-free that are on the agenda and that some of us have come here to deal with . #% This is not a matter of passengers paying for the privilege of safety ( this is no privilege but a given right ) , it is a matter of states keeping aeroplanes from crashing into populated areas on the ground . #% I am particularly pleased that my own country , Ireland , is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability . #% The mandate of the African Union Mission in Sudan has been extended so that the UN now has three more months in which to reach an agreement with the Sudanese Government on the need for a more effective multilateral force to protect civilians . #% National transport issues are a matter for national governments and , accordingly , each Member State should be free to determine its own rules and criteria on drivers ' licences . #% 
Are we willing to accept a free-for-all approach to the use of angel dust and other suspicious substances amongst Brazilian beef farmers ? #% Mr President , I should like to join with my other Irish colleagues in acknowledging the Commission response in helping to alleviate what was a very serious problem for Irish early lamb producers . #% Hence my amendment , for which I urge support , for a 2011 timetable deadline for Greece , Portugal and Ireland . #% Agriculture is facing catastrophe in Europe , both inside and outside this Union , and it should be at the top of the agenda in this discussion . #% I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her reply . #% However , the European Union must be sensitive to the needs of individual Member States when it comes to foreign policy matters . #% It is essential , as Commissioner McCreevy stated , that we deliver a better Services Directive which will unleash the enormous economic potential of the services sector in Europe . #% Mr Commissioner , deny it as you will , but is that not the truth of the matter that these socio-economic pressures help you attain that goal ? #% The list of these countries is very long , but the traditional ones are Belize , Panama , Honduras and St Vincent and the Grenadines . #% Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report . #% Secondly , in formulating these proposals , have you also looked at the use of alternative industry or energy , particularly with respect to the use of sugar beet in biofuels/bioenergy ? #% First of all , they involve very high pressure equipment , which would present health and safety risks to mechanics who do not have the expertise to service them . #% There is massive repression of journalists and campaigners for justice , for communities and for workers . #% I believe that EU Enlargement will help to build a more effective European Union . #% I would be in favour of looking at an innovation reserve with the appropriate procedures of decentralization and subsidiarity . #% They are there now , as well as the French , Belgians and the Irish . #% On the day when heads of state and government signed the Constitution in Rome , I happened to be in Bratislava , Slovakia , where I was privileged to participate in the opening of the House of Europe . #% Accordingly , it is fitting that the passing of such a sporting colossus should be noted in this international parliament . #% Mr President , thank you Mr Soulier for your introduction . #% Fish farming offers prospects for the disadvantaged regions . #% There is a world of a difference . #% I know , for example , that it is extremely difficult to find an airline 's complaints department . #% The livelihoods of many of my constituents are dependent on the marine sector and a coherent safety policy for all facets of maritime transport is an urgent necessity . #% My work in the area of children and children 's rights clearly indicates that this is an important and very vital extension of the role Mr Söderman has been fulfilling so splendidly . #% It is a major blow to the public 's right to choose alternative forms of medicine , the right to try and avoid relying on pharmaceutical industries and their products . #% Madam President , since July 1997 , the European Parliament has been a staunch defender of the autonomy of Hong Kong under the ` one-country two-systems ' policy . #% Ireland is somewhere in between at EUR 11 000 per capita . #% I wish to thank the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , and particularly its chairman , Hedy d'Ancona , for accepting my amendment calling for appropriate facilities to be provided for pregnant women in prisons . #% I also support the approach taken by Commissioner Byrne in guaranteeing that all interested parties are given due representation with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations under the White Paper on food safety . #% That is the essence of the way democratic control should work in the area of liberty and security . #% I believe it is possible . #% Mr President , as parliamentarians we have a duty to uphold the democratic will of the citizens we represent in keeping with the laws and the constitutions of our sovereign Member States . #% Could you confirm , however , that there will be an opportunity for those two commissioners to report to us on the important negotiations at Doha and whether the EU 's views were accepted or not . #% You say there will be no further funding . #% Gas is increasingly becoming a more popular form of energy used in both residential and commercial set-ups . #% There must always be confidence in the fiscal framework that underpins the European Union . #% The fight against unemployment must be put on a par with attainment of EMU . #% On the question of China , it is neither wise nor indeed feasible to believe that we can ignore or isolate China . #% Oil is a costly , non-renewable energy source , which should not be used wastefully . #% This figure must increase to at least USD 10 billion a year if we are to combat the disease effectively . #% We do not want peace here and wars in other parts of the world . #% Gama is , in my view , in breach of the anti-discrimination directives . #% I want to compliment Mr Bruton the Taoiseach , Mr Spring the Tánaiste and Mr Mitchell all of whom worked extremely hard and contributed immensely to that success . #% It is a tragedy that the Irish Government failed , and in fact , did not even try , to have adequate safeguards included in the draft changes to protect Irish neutrality and did not propose that the objective of disarmament be written into the Treaty . #% Consider , too , a Member State 's commitment in relation to the basic regulation which was reviewed last December : again , they took out the opportunity which was used by the Spanish in the past to ban driftnets . #% The Commission currently contributes financially to the creation of European biofuel projects . #% The international community has no option but to cooperate in helping these unfortunate people . #% On a personal basis I would like to wish him some short period of relaxation in one of the many beautiful Greek islands which some of us had a opportunity of visiting in recent times , during the presidency . #% We also feel that the Council should wake up and join the real world , because it seems to think that this is unnecessary . #% However , we do not have sole responsibility , and countries such as the United States should be reminded that they have a responsibility too . #% Turning briefly to the reports , the proposal from the Commission to allocate an extra ECU 1.4 billion to the beef sector is very welcome but I can not accept the method of funding proposed , namely to reduce aid to cereal farmers by the same amount . #% I also feel that inorganic substances must be handled differently to organic chemicals . #% This regulation demonstrates the added value that the European Union can provide in terms of rights for European citizens . #% While I welcome this Parliament ' s contribution , I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the European Commission over the years , and in particular former Presidents , President Delors , our colleague and former President , Jacques Santer , and now President Prodi who , in his statement yesterday , committed himself to the continuation of funds towards the various programmes in Northern Ireland . #% They should work with the clubs to inform and educate the general public , and especially sports fans and supporters , about the scale of the problem of forced prostitution and trafficking in human being . #% We must remember , as Europe integrates more closely , that it is very important that we seek to protect and promote our different cultural and linguistic diversities within the EU itself . #% Changing the essential balance between human activity and our environment led to the loss of this precious ecosystem . #% We had a fundamental reform of the CAP in 1992 . #% This forum is also part of the debate on the overall future of Europe that is ongoing in all 15 Member States of the European Union in the run-up to the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 . #% President-in-Office , in dealing with a sovereign government , is it not important , unlike the initial questioner , to always keep a sense of balance ? #% Having listened to the extent of plans that the Commission has in relation to animal welfare , I can only wish that they had similar plans in relation to the welfare of children . #% Mrs Wallis has failed to provide compelling evidence of the need for an optional instrument . #% However , the way to do that is not by legalisation . #% A final matter which gets very little attention is what is done with the vessels . #% There must be a strong commitment by all governments to ensure that equivalent telecommunications are provided in both urban and particularly rural areas . #% I believe - after an 18 months ' investigation by a UK newspaper , following your investigation - that time is running out and the car industry now wants to find a settlement to this issue . #% 
On human rights questions , the politics of the issue should be secondary to the need to outline concerns and criticisms -- if they are warranted -- based on credible facts . #% This anger was fuelled by the massive disappointment at what was perceived to be the intimidation of the minority with the participation of the police force and the British Army in that exercise . #% The effect would have been to end the British measuring of bottled milk in pints and would change the size of our standard loaf . #% Hopefully this Eurobarometer poll will be reflected when the Irish electorate next have an opportunity of making a decision on the issue . #% In this respect , I hope the Commission will continue its efforts on the international scene to impress upon the US the necessity to come on board on this vital issue . #% I departed only once from that list : to show support for what was available . #% He has given undertakings that once the children are returned to his custody their mother will continue to have visiting rights as before , thus restoring the children 's right to have a relationship with both parents . #% In rural areas , for many years , even before the Irish Free State came into existence , we sometimes had this service of a post office . #% There can be no enlargement unless the applicant states are fit to join the single currency , posing no threat to its integrity and status , and are willing to join so as to avoid making the present two-tier Union even worse . #% Mr President , I support the cooperation which the European Union and the United States have undertaken for the fight against terrorism . #% The provisions of these conventions must be honoured and we can not arbitrarily throw them out of the window when it does not suit us . #% In principle the Liberal Group believes this is wrong and in practice we will not be a rubber stamp . #% However , even if we achieve the increased budget sought in this report , increasing it to EUR 54 million , we will still be only scratching the surface . #% This was the case in the seventies and eighties but it is no longer with our screening and sterilisation process . #% In a world of such bad news , it is good to hear such good news from time to time . #% As Mrs Flesch said , we have worked very closely on this report . #% in writing . - The Basel Committee seeks to reform the Basel II framework in order to strengthen the resilience of the banking system . #% In particular , we need to be vigilant where workers are exposed to dangers and to risks and where they are less well represented by trade unions . #% The European Union must ensure that the interests of each individual citizen are protected at all times . #% Who could have forecast 60 years ago where we all are now ? #% It calls on the Commission to provide the European Parliament with a quarterly list of cases listing Member States taken to the Court of Justice in the field of waste management . #% My farmers in Northern Ireland are facing a reduction of EUR 60 million because of mapping . #% In this respect , it is imperative that we encourage a preventive approach and I welcome a number of recent Commission initiatives in this area . #% All the applicant countries are in need of substantial help to develop industry and infrastructure . #% In all countries we have a major problem with more and more oppressive legislation being introduced . #% The health problems associated with obesity are well known : heart disease , strokes , high cholesterol and diabetes top the list . #% Colleagues , if you want Europe to matter to the people in your constituency , choose subjects which interest them . #% We are lucky to have even ordinary railway links . #% Furthermore we should seek balanced agreements with our partners in developing countries where we are fishing at present and combine this with expansion in aquaculture , thereby protecting their fishing resources and providing new sources of production within the EU . #% We have already had the example of 11 September . #% We must involve the countries that suffer from those scourges in the research . #% I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions . #% The live export incident involving Germany and the Lebanon this summer resulted from the inexperience of the German authorities , as they are infrequent exporters of live animals and had no prior veterinary agreement with the Lebanese . #% There is , however , a necessity and an urgency for the state to be involved in the protection of workers and the social protection aspects . #% Having said that , we have a population of 4 million people , and we export 90 % of our production . #% In all our deliberations we have to remember the victims of terrorist violence and , today in particular , the victims of ETA violence in Spain over the last few years . #% It is not simply a matter of training for particular job skills , although people with a low educational base face a higher risk of unemployment and such inequalities of education need to be particularly targeted in the case of both women and men . #% Many of these may not in fact be cases of parental abduction , but may be simply criminal abduction . #% However , there are some questions which remain unresolved and these issues should be viewed in a new context following the prolonged closure of European airspace . #% If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success . #% I have a couple of questions , Commissioner . #% The announcement was made today in Ireland . #% The quality of our agricultural products is something that needs to be capitalised on . #% The President-in-Office will recall the reticence , concern and even fearful response of many British and , indeed , Irish citizens to the decimalization of our respective currencies during the 1960s . #% It came about as a partnership between the local county council , the Romanian Government and two Irish NGOs -- Focus on Romania and the Aurelia Trust . #% We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year , but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with . #% In the case of Ireland where I come from , it is estimated that it would take 10 billion euro to bring our road networks up to the average EU standard , even if we have just enjoyed six years of very generous structural funds . #% The purpose of this draft framework decision is to ensure that the results of laboratory activities in one Member State are recognised as being equivalent to the results of laboratory activities in other Member States , thereby guaranteeing legal certainty to the suspects and improved judicial cooperation where evidence of one Member State is used in proceedings in another Member State . #% It seems the only thing they are willing to listen to is the threat of fines . #% Why did you not tell it between March and December ? #% In practice , nuclear decision-making in the UK falls far short of democratic standards . #% As someone from Northern Ireland , I would just like to say that the people there were very envious of the cohesion funding received by the Republic of Ireland , because it certainly helped that country . #% These measures will be of significant help to SMEs . #% If the quotas are being observed , surely it is in the interest of the fishing communities of the regions and the individuals involved to go out and catch these fish with the smallest possible number of fishing vessels . #% That is not to say that it is not a factor . #% Had these decisions been fudged , the entire EMU project would have been undermined . #% I would like to ask the Council to comment on the fact that a growing number of Member States have expressed serious concern regarding the success of the regime , and that the Commission 's recent statement that there is unanimous agreement that the current legislation ` provides a clear , simple and easily enforceable solution ' is totally misleading . #% You can not be a terrorist by night and a politician by day . #% Commissioner Nielson must come to this House and explain his use of PR men and spin doctors in this disgraceful display of neglect . #% That is the sort of thing we have to look at if we are going to get rid of corruption . #% EU leaders had extended an invitation to you , Madam President , to attend the meeting : a recognition of the importance of the European Parliament as an institution . #% In the common position antibiotic-resistant genes would just `` be phased out '' in the future , and only if `` they may have any adverse effects on human health and the environment '' . #% It is important that negotiations between Israel and Syria should resume quickly and that the Lebanese track of the Middle East peace process should also be addressed . #% As a result , the Commission ended the last day trying to exclude us from the press conference , albeit very politely and diplomatically . #% Many key European policies are being re-evaluated in the context of the Agenda 2000 programme which is to be put into place to take account of the impending enlargement of the European Union itself . #% It is very important , in my view , that there is a clear definition of terrorist acts , as a national can not and should not be extradited from one country in Europe to another unless the specified crime is a crime in his or her host Member State . #% 
It is important that all EU institutions work together to ensure the development of a coherent European strategy against organised crime . #% This suggestion is an indication of the obsession of the europhile leaders of Europe , an obsession that knows no bounds . #% This greatly concerns the Irish fishermen as Ireland has experimented with alternatives to bottom trawlers and so far no success has been achieved . #% Especially for island states in the EU including Ireland , it really warrants particular attention and I wonder what the Commissioner is actually afraid of by refusing to carry out the study that so many people have called for . #% It is my belief that this aid programme continues to make a valuable contribution towards the promotion of the economic developments of the disadvantaged within South Africa and I hope that this programme will be continued after 1999 . #% How can we cooperate to effectively deliver assistance to the countries we are trying to assist ? #% While the European food chain remains one of the safest in the world , recent scandals have damaged our consumers ' confidence in the food we eat and the methods we use to produce it . #% I am pleased to see that in Amendment 14 , along with other vulnerable groups , women with disabilities were specifically mentioned as being particularly vulnerable to violence . #% In this regard the role of farmers and processors is crucial . #% The Court of Auditors ' report - and Parliament supports this - draws attention to the fact that we should perhaps utilise our resources better in a way that might encourage greater consumption of dairy products on our European markets , rather than subsidising unused quantities . #% We must now prepare for the time when donations turn from a flood to a trickle , once the glare of the media is turned away from Asia . #% We do need to take the public with us and if that was his point it is a valid one . #% This was an answer to a question I tabled on 11 October 2000 : ` the Commission , following extensive consultations with all parties concerned , concluded that detailed harmonisation of national rules in this area , over and above those that already exist , is neither desirable nor necessary and would not be justified from the point of view of subsidiarity or proportionality ' . #% There will always be accidents . #% The best way to defend the Tamil people is through a united struggle of Tamil and Sinhala workers and poor against the current government and its new liberal policies , and through the socialist transformation of Sri Lankan society , under which the marvellous resources of that country could be used for the benefit of the entire population . #% This is on the IGC agenda as well , but so far all we have heard about is a European Commission action plan for enterprise -- which received a very lukewarm reception indeed and was accused of lacking focus and tangible recommendations . #% I realise that a number of amendments which are good amendments in their own right are going to be rejected here tomorrow , but the Commission and Council should bear in mind that they are being rejected in order to facilitate this agreement , not because we disagree with them . #% I fail to see the need to reopen this debate in the context of this report . #% It has been proposed by the umbrella organisation -- an alliance of 115 NGOs and civil organisations in Colombia -- which is seeking to engage the civilian population in finding solutions to the 40 years of conflict . #% I believe that this agency should be established without delay . #% It has never been demonstrated that this can be achieved and technical advice from engineers involved in microchip design and manufacture indicates that it will never be easy or even possible to achieve . #% Like others , I urge the Council to fast-track the statute so that we , as MEPs , can fight our next election under the politics of Europe and not the politics of expenses . #% Again , what seems to be forgotten in this whole discussion and debate is that in July this House gave its endorsement and its confidence to Mr Barroso . #% I am glad that mercury , which is probably the most neurotoxic pollutant of them all , comes under scrutiny in Mrs Ries ' report . #% Where it has been hit and miss , I have heard some very bad reports of the attitude of some people in the Commission in relation to annual action programmes . #% This House must support freedom of speech and freedom of media expression . #% In the end , OLAF might have the political leverage and power to demand as much money and staff as it wanted . #% It is not , as Mr Mote said , that the Irish were kept in ignorance : they were treated differently . #% If we are to succeed in bringing communities together from both sides of the sectarian divide continued funding for the PEACE programme is crucial #% The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining stationary applications . #% So , it is a good resolution . #% However , I am bound to say in respect of the issues under review to do with fraud , corruption and mismanagement that tonight 's contribution fell short of being a tour de force . #% The restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances , on the one hand , and the prevention of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the other is what we are talking about here in the two directives before us . #% I listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said . #% At the same time I would point out that in doing this we have to take special account of the concerns of developing countries , which might not be able to meet the requirements in the same timescale . #% We also have an obligation to maintain the European model of agriculture , which is based on family farm units and keeping a vibrant rural community . #% We in Parliament have made the whole drugs issue a top priority . #% Mr President , Commissioner , many questions have been asked today and time does not permit me to repeat them , particularly those questions asked by my colleague , Liam Hyland , and indeed colleague De Rossa in relation to the proportionality of the response . #% We must send a signal to counterfeiters and pirates that we are serious about closing the enforcement loopholes that they exploit . #% It is obvious that Syria , Iran , Cuba indeed , and North Korea are also on the agenda . #% I ask the Commission to bring forward further programmes along these lines to tackle this life-threatening problem that faces all of Europe . #% Cooperation between Member States is the foundation of this Union ; however , that cooperation has always been based on mutual consent . #% However , I welcome the response , as now set out by the Commission President . #% Let us hope that those disagreements , in the future , will only be in the WTO , over steel or on trade . #% The Commission considered that for costly , long-lasting , complex products , such as motor vehicles , protection of the design relating to individual parts could exclude or limit competition , creating a captive market in spare parts in the absence of an appropriate derogation . #% I would like to take the questions on behalf of Mr Andrews , Mr Hyland and Mr Fitzsimons , who are at an ongoing Constitutional Affairs Committee meeting . #% I have to say here today that we must also stop blaming workers , workers who are now under sentence of death for the illegal and criminal activities of the nuclear industry . #% Presently , many of the more difficult chapters of discussions still remain unopened , and these include agricultural issues , the free movement of persons , the implementation of EU social and employment legislation and the incorporation of many EU directives and regulations in the field of environmental matters . #% Is this also a situation which is governed by market forces or is there , in fact , a problem with its legality ? #% There are a broad range of projects which we can support , involving the promotion and protection of human rights and support for democracy and good governance in developing countries . #% It is , in fact , an international agreement and a trade agreement . #% This may not be music to the ears of the proponents of sweeping CAP reform but that is the reality of the conclusions of the Brussels Summit . #% Could I ask you to include Frankfurt ? #% The only way , in my view , in which you can demonstrate your commitment is to extract the ` country of origin ' principle , which directly attacks the European social model and which directly attacks the solidarity and approach to the development of a European single market . #% I endorse wholeheartedly the decision of the European summit to give its support to Yasser Arafat as the leader of the Palestinian people and I condemn without reservation the misuse of the Security Council veto in blocking the appointment of international observers to the Middle East conflict . #% However , we should not imagine that this was an ideal world in which to live . #% The fishing industry is being held accountable for the damage it wreaks on the marine community . #% A colleague spoke about it earlier . #% Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members , rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent ? #% It is only by ensuring peace and security , democracy and political stability , that Nigeria can haul itself out of poverty and create a wealth and social justice which will in turn lead people away from violence as a method of conflict resolution . #% I have to say that today was a victory for Laeken , for the Commission and Council on the telecoms package , but it was not a victory for democracy in this House . #% There is always a dilemma between humanitarian aid and the political dimension . #% It is therefore an extremely important responsibility of your presidency to ensure that the documentation of the Intergovernmental Conference is made available in public , as well as all responses to that documentation . #% This means that educational training in the field of information technology is also changing all the time . #% Today , as the Prime Minister has remarked , we are all Americans , we are all New Yorkers , we are all Washingtonians . #% How it is funded hardly makes it more or less ethical . #% 
In introducing a general clause on fair trading , the detail of the directive will be vital if it is to work for the benefit of consumers and not to be perceived by businesses as more red tape and bureaucracy . #% In many cases it is a whole family transaction . #% Experts from the EU accounting industry said that ` it could never happen in Europe ' , but then we had Parmalat , which had an audit committee -- as did Enron -- made up of eminent independent professors . #% The answer to difference is to respect it . #% It argues that a better understanding of the relationship between employment ( paid work ) and family obligations ( unpaid work ) is essential to enhance economic independence of women and consequently gender equality . #% From numerous media reports , it appears that the Commissioner with responsibility for trade is calling for restraint in this affair and has made a plea to avoid what he calls protectionist thinking . #% It is important so that Cambodia can move forward into the future that those responsible for heinous crimes against the Cambodian population be brought to justice . #% Agreement on the final contents of a new revised Treaty must be accompanied by an agreement on the future direction of the major common policies and on the framework for enlargement negotiations . #% Whatever the reform , it is vitally important that smaller Member States retain their right to nominate a Member of the Commission . #% Can I ask you specifically whether the debate on the services directive in the Council over the next couple of months will be open to the public , and whether the decisions made by the Member States individually will be available to the public ? #% Mr President , the Danish presidency set itself an extremely ambitious agenda for the Copenhagen Summit . #% Since Ireland joined the European Union - I only mention Ireland because I am very familiar with what happened obviously , but you can draw lessons for other areas - our many small farms were reduced gradually in number . #% Once properly implemented and extended to include all the other sectors , Kyoto will provide a flexible , market-based mechanism to spread the burden of paying for global warming equitably across all sectors . #% I also hope that it will force the UK Treasury and Miss Knight , as Economic Secretary , to pay their bills on time . #% We should not claim that a single currency will resolve unemployment . #% Think again , Commissioner . #% If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence , the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs . #% I understand that was what the money was actually used for . #% For example , from an Irish perspective , Aer Lingus is highly dependent on transatlantic travel . #% What is the situation concerning our immunity in other Member States ? #% Fishermen must also be more involved in the work of scientists in order to establish mutual confidence . #% The issue of pensions , future contributions and necessity of securing pensions , is partly financial , no matter what anybody says . #% However , what is more alarming is the projected sea-level rise , which is more than twice the three-inch rise that occurred during the latter part of the previous century . #% I did not believe that Turkey would change overnight because we had a customs union . #% But within the House there is a committee responsible for incorporating the substantive work . #% But let us ensure that the debate is based on fact , truth and the written text and not on misconceptions . #% If people think owners do not influence newspapers think again . #% I should like to know : if Parliament approves our amendment for an independent mid-term review , would the Commission accept such a review ? #% Have you any estimate -- at Commission level -- of how long it will take Romania to tackle what is a huge problem for the country ? #% Mr President , I welcome this debate and I welcome very much the Commission 's communication on which it is based . #% I support the enlargement of the Union , but such a process can not take place until key EU institutions , including the Commission , the Council , and of course Parliament , reform their internal decision-making operations . #% However welcome some of these developments may be , more needs to be done . #% The opening of negotiations with six applicant countries this week in Brussels constitutes an historic step in the evolution of the European Union . #% The Statute we are dealing with , taken together with the Statute of Members of Parliament and with the very positive outcome of the Convention , indicates a coming-of-age for the European Union . #% She has pointed to cases of deliberate cruelty and mistreatment of animals which have occurred in some Member States . #% But the present numbers of Spanish vessels in the Irish Box hoover up more fish than the whole Irish fishing effort can do itself . #% They did not receive funding from the European Union and they could not receive it unless they were part of EWL , which claimed to be the only voice for women throughout Europe . #% This regulation was based , curiously and questionably , on design criteria rather than performance criteria . #% Will it be a general clause for comitology , or a more specific rule which allows comitology only within a set of fixed aims , as it would appear the rapporteur prefers ? #% Waste from electronic and electrical equipment is now one of the fastest growing waste streams in the European Union . #% Liberalisation leads to a dash for gas , forcing us to import gas from some very fragile regimes . #% I agree with Ms McKenna that so far the free sale of these products - which , I repeat , I do not regard as food supplements - has not caused any problem , and I see no reason to interfere with that sale . #% Mr President , cooperation in the field of education in Europe has brought many students together from different parts of the European Union , as well as students from the accession countries . #% It is not and can not be ! #% The government has responded positively to Commission comments with regard to nitrates in groundwater and has in fact established that phosphorous represents a greater threat . #% In the same period there have been profound increases in the extent and quantity of habitats and natural resources that are formally recognised and protected . #% However , I am disappointed that reductions are being made in the overall budgetary allocation but I hope that the European Council , when it comes to reviewing the second reading of the EU budget for the year 2000 , will take on board the recommendation of this Parliament that it should increase the funding for the programme to EUR 67 million or IEP 53 million in next year ' s allocation . #% To remove Sunday as a day of rest puts yet another obstacle in the way of successful family life . #% The biggest engine of growth and employment in economic terms should be given extra support . #% There seems to be remarkable consensus in the House today but I would like to make a few points . #% There are plenty of criticisms to make of Nice with regard to qualified majority and the role of smaller states , but for people who are fair-minded and rational , none of the criticisms should be that it went too far . #% I have looked at some of the other programmes that we have funded before this , and there seems to be an indication that there is a much greater percentage of the funding going towards male workers that have been made redundant . #% There are 700 of us . #% You have represented us all with very great dignity and at all times showed great respect for all the Members of this Parliament . #% The EU should financially support that endeavour . #% At this very moment two shipments of nuclear fuel which were rejected by Japan because of the falsification of safety data by BNFL are approaching the shores of Europe , and will enter the narrow confines of the Irish Sea . #% This is because , if that young child needs the constant reassuring presence of its mother , not having her will have an impact , despite all the very worthy reasons for her absence . #% Training can not replace a poor education and there is considerable risk that those with a strong education base will benefit further from lifelong learning and those without it will become even further marginalised . #% I therefore today in the votes in the Parliament opposed any further reduction in stocking density as such will inevitably severely affect the economics of broiler chicken production within Europe . #% The pace of reform is the main issue . #% At the moment , Germany has a massive surplus in its balance of trade with the rest of the Union - something like 25 billion . #% That is something that we should be considering seriously at European level . #% The Green Group can not , however , agree that nuclear energy is safe or an acceptable replacement for oil . #% We are all very concerned about the impact on employment of the beef crisis . #% However , serious allegations have been made that the Israeli defence forces were involved in extra-judicial executions and the use of human shields . #% I strongly support their flexibility . #% 
This is quite appalling because it represents a failure to recognize that European fleets are far too large and need to be reduced . #% The difficulty is that everyone has some justification for taking action , but there is no acceptable justification for displacing tens of thousands of innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians . #% When will they reply ? #% Breast implant advertising specifically - indeed implant advertising of any kind - should be regulated . #% Mr President , sometimes it is important to explore the background to a situation . #% It goes back to colonial times when the British came back from the colonised countries and hung their trophies on the wall . #% I would like the Commission to clarify this particular matter this evening . #% Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties . #% The deadly cycle of attack and reprisal has to be broken . #% The Conference of Presidents took on board his opinion , as expressed in that letter , that there was nothing to substantiate the allegations made . #% This directive will have major implications for waste disposal throughout the EU and especially in Ireland where waste management has tended to focus exclusively on landfill . #% Harbouring terrorists is a crime in itself . #% It has become too large and divided . #% This must be achieved by ensuring greater enforcement of our road safety legislation and improving the quality of our road driving . #% Their concerns are rather more basic . #% Madam President , it being the last day of the pre-Christmas season , Mr Evans will be happy to hear that we are totally in agreement with him . #% This charter spells out responsibilities and entitlements , such as full recognition by the home university of academic achievements , as well as credits to be obtained by students during their term on Erasmus . #% The Commission will not obtain their cooperation unless they are given the support they require . #% It becomes more urgent because new freedoms are emerging even as I speak , as we can see in the television pictures from Kabul . #% We can only , in conciliation , go as far as amendments allow us in second reading . #% If there is one area in which we should demand subsidiarity from the national states to the European Union , it is here . #% It should look at setting up an EU trust mark or an EU quality assurance scheme to give the consumer the trust and the confidence to use these services which respect consumers ' rights and working rights . #% We in this House watched murder and rape in Bosnia . #% Denmark and other Nordic states are also concerned at the radioactive contamination of their seas and fishing grounds from reprocessing at Sellafield . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I know that this is not one of our most headline-grabbing reports , but it deserves to be , because this Prospectus Directive has actually been crucial to regulating European firms ' access to capital . #% The public at large does not understand the tactical manoeuvring behind these battles . #% I welcome the concentration on a select number of priority areas under the forthcoming programme . #% This is an issue which affects aspects of everyday life . #% Mr President , I was there in Lisbon , representing Parliament when the Energy Charter Treaty was signed . #% We should return to that at a later stage . #% That is why the Commission must set in train open procedures to transmit up-to-date information on the whole range of regulations , directives and international accords being discussed and enacted by the Union . #% Another bombing of Iraq would be mass murder . #% In relation to services , however , we have had over 50 years of Member State protectionism and restrictive practices , from complicated bureaucratic hurdles and time delays to financial penalties to obscure qualification requirements . #% That is a separate question but I can assure the Member that Ireland has not experienced any difficulties in this regard . #% It is no coincidence that practically the only area that has experienced substantial reforms is that of child protection , to some extent due to the interest taken in this by the European Parliament . #% This has resulted in some very good publicity for Parliament . #% We need to lift the moratorium and have a rational regulatory approach to GM technology to allow consumers to make informed choices . #% This will ensure that enlargement negotiations can be concluded by the Copenhagen Summit of EU leaders in December 2002 . #% As has been said by Mr Verhofstadt , there should be no taboos in our debate and the idea of federalism and a constitution for Europe could guarantee the role of the citizens in small states better than any other form of governance . #% I am not sure whether the directive covers private aircraft , I feel that it does . #% Certainly one of the key results of this new broader EU policy has been the broadening of powers to Europol . #% The very existence of the Ombudsman 's office , I believe , is a deterrent to maladministration , and the 10th anniversary of that office deserves a review of the statute . #% The primary motive of much organised crime is financial crime . #% We must protect fishing regions where our fish stocks are under threat and the Irish Box and the Irish Sea is one such region . #% I have been taken aback by the willingness of fellow MEPs , at times , to give other institutions carte blanche in this important area , so long as some little interest of theirs or influence was not lost . #% The process of enlarging the Union will be difficult both for the applicant countries and for the existing Member States . #% Could we please have less regulation ; better regulation ; simpler regulation ; thoroughly vetted regulation ; risk-assessed regulation . #% But let us reflect that in most parliaments a vote of no confidence in a single member of the government results in the entire government resigning , not just the individual minister . #% However , the increased over-representation of women in ` non-standard ' employment is extremely worrying and I would like to repeat the report 's calls on the Commission to encourage Member States to ` exchange best practices and make full use of the cofinancing opportunities offered by the Structural Funds ... to ensure broader access to affordable , quality childcare and elderly care facilities so that women are not forced to undertake these duties on an informal basis ' . #% Some Member States within the Council feel that Schengen should have a treaty base , others that it should not and they do not want to sign up for it . #% We can not disguise the fact that the decision of the Israel security cabinet to remove President Arafat from the Occupied Territories has led to a deteriorating situation in the Middle East . #% I believe she has crystallised a lot of the hard work that has gone into this subject . #% Traffic has to come off the roads . #% The trouble is that we have large quantities of poultry meat in storage . #% The objective of this directive is to ensure that the injured party has a right of action against the insurer of the person who caused the accident . #% The European Union constructively facilitated the UN agreement breakthrough in Bali last December , with all parties now recognising the urgency of action . #% This is very loose but effective cooperation . #% The work programme submitted by the presidency suggests that efforts will also be made over the next six months to make progress in the negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy . #% The manufacturers will increase the price of their cars , so our consumers may not benefit from the abolition of VRT . . #% However , I also realise that it is necessary to have cuts in order to ensure that we have sufficient resources for this generation and , indeed , future generations . #% If one considers the problems we have in EU waters , one can see the potential of an EU coastguard . #% Then they warned them not to cooperate with the authorities . #% Mr President , I find it interesting that Mr Killilea quotes scientific evidence . #% America and Europe can achieve so much across a range of measures when they work together , as opposed to working against the interests of one another . #% The only merciful thing was that neither her husband nor her children were in the car when it blew up savagely within sight and sound of her own home and the school where her little daughter was playing in the playground . #% I believe that the guidelines offer the flexibility that Member States need in order to draw up those programmes . #% 
I am sure there are similar programmes in other countries , but the OECD report on local development in Ireland is one which I would commend to Members of this House . #% The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated . #% It is not civil servants who are to blame for the problems , but their political masters . #% Mr President , the Green Group welcomes the decision that was taken in June to get rid of driftnets for albacore , tuna and certain other species . #% In this capacity I can clearly state that under no circumstances should the EUR 20.3 billion currently being proposed by the draft regulation be reduced . #% Human embryos should not be created for research purposes , but this has indeed already happened in the US this summer . #% I would like to ask the two people who accused me of voting on Mr Hyland 's card to withdraw and apologise . #% The European Union is at the forefront in protecting and upholding the human rights of all its citizens . #% Such a practice is in breach of established international conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights . #% For example , has anybody done a study on the recent reform of the sugar industry in the EU to see if the decimation of the EU sugar industry has benefited those in Third World countries or if it has just benefited the sugar barons and landowners while leaving the small sugar growers in poverty ? #% My other points concerns the motion for a resolution . #% The Internet is a vital part of our interconnected information society . #% However , it is not acceptable that so many farmers are given no alternative but to withdraw from farming because of the impossibility of making a reasonable income . #% Even then the EU ' s institutional response has been largely focused on the issue of sexual abuse and trafficking and not on the wider set of EU issues that affect children . #% They feel they have nowhere to turn , that they have been heavily penalized and hammered by a large country and squeezed out by multinationals . #% I fail to understand this , and with respect find it a discourtesy to colleagues . #% We can not hope to closely examine every injury but we should and must create a system of data collection that more closely examines the injury determinants of all fatal and seriously disabling injuries , to prevent them more effectively in the future . #% Principle number one of the European Union is respect for difference . #% I believe that these funds have made a major contribution towards the peace process and that Mr Dell ` Alba should familiarise himself a little more in detail with these funds . #% Those without fishing waters or enough fishing waters of their own , must not be allowed to plunder those whose fishing grounds have already suffered at the hands of the so-called expert conservationists , who have been proved wrong on many occasions . #% As rapporteur , I am currently weighing up whether to accept a reduced programme which will actually happen or whether to argue for what should happen . #% As an Irish MEP , I am acutely aware of how we are being told to implement austerity measures and the real fear is that this will smother any opportunity for growth . #% The big difficulty is , as always , the trust of the fishermen . #% The new Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Alaa has international credibility as he is one of the Palestinian negotiators of the 1993 Oslo Accord . #% Mr President , I should like to start by complimenting Mr Bowe on his objective and balanced presentation . #% The European Parliament has worked hard in implementing legislation which reduces the use of CO2 gases . #% In relation to agricultural expenditure , I fully agree that more emphasis must be placed on the environment , food safety , traceability , animal welfare and consumer information . #% We must ensure that we do not leave the people of Europe to the likes of Mr Bonde and his ilk in other parts of Europe . #% None of us have any problems in supporting the points he made and we hope very much that the effectiveness of voluntary regulation will be demonstrated as soon as we get the first report . #% In an ideal world , responsible businesses would respond to consumer needs . #% Those who peddle that deception are best exposed by the Constitution 's own most ardent and more honest proponents . #% That is what we are doing here today . #% After the most recent enlargement that diversity is even greater and has expanded across the whole continent . #% I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her contributions , not just today , but over the period of the Finnish Presidency of the European Union . #% I also hope that a genuine and significant decision will be made in relation to the Turkish application for membership . #% Ideally our children should have both . #% I congratulate the rapporteur on his report . #% This discriminates against other fishermen and ship owners . #% The farmers of Europe and their incomes are our responsibility . #% It makes it virtually impossible for us and is not a fair procedure . #% Your job in promoting the Plan D -- debate , democracy and dialogue -- is being undermined by the fact that the Council continues to refuse to make law in public . #% Since the Tampere Summit , and following the September 11 and March 11 atrocities in the USA and Madrid , there is an understandable wish to take action against alleged criminals and terrorists . #% The energy/intensity use in most of the European Union is worsening . #% Many have to pay to sink their own pump in Ireland and pay the electricity charges . #% I would suggest that France and the Netherlands might consider establishing national conventions of Europe , to consider exactly what kind of Europe they want . #% It is no good carrying out studies which we are not going to follow up . #% Mr President , Commission proposals for a mid-term reform of the common agricultural policy have led to a very difficult debate . #% What is urgently required is a stronger policy of denial of EU funds and a facility to recoup them in respect of any company which relocates production to another Member State . #% All speakers in this Parliament are entitled to speak in their mother tongue whether that language is spoken by many or by few . #% If we really want to protect children then surely those people would have voted to ban the use of fragrances in baby products . #% For a shining success story of the power of immunisation and the need for development aid in general , look no further than the example of measles in Africa , where , largely due to vaccination programmes , deaths from the disease fell from 90 % between 2000 and 2006 . #% I also extend my compliments to Mr Whitehead on the thoroughness of his report . #% This must be the overriding consideration of European Union leaders as they search for agreement on the key aspects of future EU policies under the Agenda 2000 programme . #% Mr President , what has been proposed here is a very dangerous situation in which immigrants and asylum seekers are being treated like criminals in that they are to be fingerprinted . #% I think if people reflect on that they will find it deals with the matter raised by the honourable Member . #% They will not cooperate . #% It is still not clear whether the introduction of biometric identifiers really does increase security or whether it is rather a threat to security through the risks of abuse , technological flaws and lack of transparency and sound data protection . #% That is my understanding : there will be a resolution , but not immediately . #% We must not take from poorer countries in destructive and disabling ways . #% This merely corrects an oversight in the original text . #% The setting up of an Internet charter would be a very sensible idea and one which would be for the benefit of consumers . #% Let us hope when it is up and running that we will finally be able to produce films which people want to see , will enhance our bank of cultural products itself and also be films that other Europeans want to see and will go to . #% Given the crisis in Germany , we need more food labelling , we need more standards ; we need more quality control . #% I do not believe that the present proposals constitute a reasonable basis for negotiation . #% The age of consent varies between countries : 13 years in Spain and the Netherlands , 17 years in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland . #% Many of them have lost their children for ever . #% 
Senegal presents another problem . #% Mr President , I welcome this regulation . #% Mr President , Darfur continues to be a humanitarian crisis . #% Firstly , there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that . #% In my own city , Dublin , we have seen whole communities devastated by the scourge of drugs . #% Secondly , establishing special labelling requirements for products which have been fully tested and found to be completely safe , seems wrong to me and makes bad law . #% The American administration is preparing for war on Iraq , with unpredictable consequences that no one will be able to control . #% Mr President , the current World Trade negotiations are important to the future development of the EU , particularly in the context of enlargement . #% I can point to three individual small firms from Ireland that went into liquidation because of the late payment by the Commission for contracts those firms completed in Russia . #% I believe this must continue . #% Scientists who deliberately ignore these safeguards are doing a disservice to science and are acting contrary to the common good . #% I welcome the focus on better research in Europe , especially as we know 85 % of research today is without EU coordination . #% I come here every month to table questions but they are never reached . #% Mr President , this report , by my good friend Mrs d'Ancona , has both positive and negative aspects . #% He has made a real campaign out of this and a real mission for himself . #% The European Union should now become party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , a legal step made possible by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty . #% Cash flow is also a problem for new industries . #% Biofuels must be introduced , targets met and the work of Member States ' governments strictly monitored and evaluated . #% I welcome our political support in this regard but any future actions which are taken on this issue must be strictly dealt with under the auspices of specific United Nations mandates . #% Is it because the Commission realises that if GM agriculture goes ahead it will destroy organic farming unless we redefine ` organic ' ? #% However , the White Paper mentioned by Mr Bowis that the Commission brought forward outlines a raft of directives and regulations that need to be updated and modernised so as to make the food chain in Europe safer . #% Finally , does he agree that rural development policy will not achieve its full potential in isolation from integrated regional policy ? #% This might not look like a problem , but I am told that it is the most serious way of exporting Asian bird flu to Europe . #% This is an important factor in her report . #% I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety , public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission 's work programme for 2000 . #% We are trying very hard to change his mind on this issue with a very important report going to the ECOFIN ministers , which has just been completed by the Commission . #% The people were disappointed . #% When he started off in this job many years ago , he came forward with many legislative proposals which many people in this Parliament said were pie in the sky and would never be achieved . #% I supported this report which establishes a common register for lobbyists ( transparency register ) between the European Parliament and Commission . #% Profitability can not be at the expense of consumer rights and welfare . #% Secondly , with regard to the whole patents area , there must be protection of the ideas and creations that come from that innovative strategy and policy . #% We do not need another array of regulation or army of inspectors . #% I agree with the principles of transparency and public accessibility which are at the heart of the proposal to amend Article 40 to include a provision for public access to paediatric clinical trial information . #% She was charged with providing secret information to foreigners and is believed to have been sentenced to eight years ' imprisonment at a secret trial . #% It is a first modest and cautious step in an EU-wide commitment to fight counterfeiting and piracy . #% Certainly it would be extremely difficult and impracticable to secure the support of the European public to introduce unanimity for tax harmonisation changes or for decisions concerning foreign and security matters at European Council level . #% It is very important that consumers are aware well in advance of the actual physical changeover of currency of the real worth of the euro compared with the punt . #% That is part of the problem that exists . #% With the forecast growth in electronic shopping over the next few years , heavy bank fees for money changes will be a serious disincentive for consumers to shop over the Internet . #% Having congratulated the Irish presidency , I should also like to extend my congratulations to the commitment and professionalism of the Irish civil service and the diplomatic corps , without whose support it would not have been possible to make progress . #% The Fischler proposals cast a great shadow over rural Europe to begin with , but at the end of the day we have to appreciate that the outcome , while not totally satisfactory , certainly is not disastrous by any means . #% The question of safety of nuclear fuel shipments is an urgent one . #% We are delighted that Mr Gusmão has received this award . #% There are 16 individual directives dealing with the purchase , marketing and presentation of fertiliser for sale . #% I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point . #% In my view , there is a key question to be answered . #% The EU had its chance to give such equality of funding to Northern Ireland for necessary infrastructure but it failed , by making national statistics instead of regional need the threshold for access . #% After the summit failure , the immediate need was for a period of calm reflection by Member State governments and EU institutions . #% If he is not aware , I would strongly suggest that the Council familiarises itself with this situation . #% As many speakers have mentioned , we know that in many situations there are problems regarding access to legal representatives before and during trials . #% It is a disgrace that only 47 Members voted in favour of my amendment which criticized Member States which transferred their vessels to third countries which are already overexploited by the fisheries agreements or transferred their vessels to countries like Britain . #% If European citizens are to support the EU , they must be assured that the EU will deliver for them and their families . #% Does he agree that the contribution of farmers to a society can not always be evaluated in purely economic terms and that their role as environmental managers and guarantors of food security and quality puts them outside the economic realm of other professions ? #% This will not serve the best interests of our poorest communities , with deliberate misinformation and hijacking this debate for narrow party political advantage . #% How can we then claim that our products are unique , that they are our rich regional flavour , or that they are from our region at all ? #% They were obviously monitoring the progress of this report through the committee , and I am pleased that they have rejected a proposal to allow unlimited quantities of herring into the Union , quantities of fresh , chilled and frozen herring at preferable rates of duty . #% While it is desirable to create a level playing field it may also be necessary to provide subsidies for certain types of energy in order to promote other objectives . #% We all agree that the EU budget must be framed in such a way as to meet its objectives . #% A 1 % per annum improvement would be very easy to achieve . #% Naturally there is need for close , transparent cooperation between the NRAs and the Commission . #% Yesterday I voted against the joint resolution on the findings of this special Committee of Inquiry on BSE because I do not believe that any British minister is answerable in law to this Parliament or any of its committees . #% It is worth noting , however , that we have heard this argument since discussions about Directive 90/220/EEC first started in 1989 . #% There still is , as Commissioner Kallas said earlier , a problem in certain areas of human rights . #% Mr President , groundwater is a priceless natural resource , not a national resource , and it should be treated as a resource without which humanity can not survive . #% Does the President-in-Office believe that the European Union could channel aid to alleviate starvation more effectively than is now the case ? #% I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended . #% 
Mr President , it is pleasant to renew acquaintance in this forum with Mr Pearson , who served with effect for some time in Northern Ireland , as did Commissioner Mandelson . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I think it is important for us to have this discussion in the light of the upcoming adoption of an ILO Convention on Domestic Workers . #% Or check whether they have been toasted on both sides at Torremolinos during the previous fortnight when they were on holiday and say ` Sorry , you ca n't go in the sun this week at all ' ? #% I would like to know exactly how many people you counted in the chamber today ? #% Many people can not make those investments of their own accord . #% I believe it would be good if the Commissioner , on behalf of the 25 Member States , would engage in the campaign to get an international agreement on standards and rules in regulating eGambling . #% I was in the presence of a cult . #% To do otherwise would be to fail in providing security for its citizens and that must be the prime concern of any government . #% We can sit back on our laurels and wait and see . #% Sensitive and sensible implementation must be encouraged to ensure political and public cooperation and understanding of what we have to achieve . #% Parliament recently voted to maintain and increase funding for the SAVE programme . #% Mr President , I would like to read a section from the April 2001 report of the Scientific , Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries . #% How does the Commission evaluate , from the perspective of a fair and efficient working of the internal market , the situation within the European defence industry , where in different Member States a significant number of highly skilled jobs appear to be at risk ? #% However , I do not believe it is to the best advantage of the European peoples . #% I should like to relate an anecdote . #% This reference , which was accepted by the Culture and Youth Committee as well as Parliament , referred to the need to examine the role of the family among those factors which have promoted and hampered the social integration of young people . #% Despite a short six months in which to work , Ireland sponsored positive initiatives like the ` Communicating Europe ' initiative . #% They , despite their pain , have opted to try and prevent others facing the same trauma in the future . #% There was particular emphasis at this summit on the European area of research and innovation , following the excellent communication from Commissioner Busquin . #% I want in particular to assure my colleagues here that the vast majority of men would support them fully in ensuring that they have full equality of rights , parity of esteem and protection against any violence whatsoever . #% In one of the slums there I visited a school which has 1 690 students and 22 teachers . #% However , with Urban II coming to an end , a similar need in highly deprived areas in East and South Belfast remains unmet . #% Amendments were adopted , however , which attempted to underline the fact that stricter national measures are allowed under single market measures , provided they are proportionate , non-discriminatory and not purely economic in nature . #% Madam President , my group does not have a copy of this amendment , nor does it exist in the actual amendments which have been tabled . #% Another aspect I want to highlight is the changing role of the family and community . #% Obviously it was not tabled within the deadline and I have yet to receive a very clear explanation . #% We have to do everything we can to try and stop the forced labour and the human rights abuses . #% I want in particular to pay tribute to Commissioner Bonino who , over the weekend , made statements which were so incisive and so transparent that the people of Europe - I am sure of it - saw for the first time a commissioner coming out and saying exactly what needed to be done ; saying exactly what the people of Europe wanted to hear . #% It argued that there is no crisis involving hake and completely removed it from the proposal . #% Next October governments will hold a special meeting to consider the establishment of a European area of freedom , security and justice . #% I repeat the call that the godfathers must not be allowed to remain outside European laws . #% Only last November the European Parliament voted in favour of a proposal which I tabled calling for a universal ban on the cloning of human beings . #% Let us make no mistake about that . #% But I do not want a market where competition rules supreme . #% Is there a policy to deal with such chaos in the mind of the Commission ? #% It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem . #% It is the least we can do for the parents and families of all the children who have been abducted , including Julie , Melissa and Lubna . #% Under this draft recommendation , each plan should define the geographical area which it covers , cover a defined period of time , include specific provisions for its revision , identify the specific sites or types of installations covered , prescribe the programmes for routine environmental inspections , provide for and outline the procedures for non-routine environmental inspections , provide for coordination between the different inspecting authorities . #% I find this extraordinary . #% It moves money as well as infiltrating business , politics and worldwide legal and police systems with impunity . #% Would it not be wonderful for us if a Member of this House were to become the constitutional Head of State of Ireland , especially since it is someone who is committed to the ideal of European integration , breaking down barriers , sweeping aside old enmities ? #% However , whilst there is a strong international commitment to revise the Basel framework , it is crucially important that such revision strikes the right balance between various business models , investment and traditional retail banking , different legal forms and predominant financing of the corporate sector through bank lending in Europe . #% The concept of crisis management systems needs careful handling . #% If nuclear safety and nuclear energy are so safe , why are not the majority of these installations located near the population centres of the south-east of England ? #% A huge amount of damage has already been done to consumer trust and consumer confidence in the recent past . #% I am particularly annoyed and vexed by the fact that in the UK it is said that its record employment rates are second to none in the EU . #% In Ireland last year , 1 947 women and 3 269 children were admitted to refuges . #% I would like to underline to you , as I have done in my report , a number of points that I feel strongly about . #% We are never there when it counts . #% One concerns the Middle East . #% I urge Members of this House to give it that time and to give it every means at the disposal of this Parliament to complete its work . #% I also welcome the proposals in Mr Lage 's report relating to the structural funds . #% We now have an opportunity to encourage diversification . #% Let there be no ambiguity : the Irish people are a generous people . #% In conclusion , mechanically propelled vehicles have become weapons of mass destruction on our roads and we have become somewhat immune to that destruction . #% We must also make clear that adoption and reproductive rights ( including assisted human reproduction ) are not within the scope of the directive . #% If we are going to ask consumers to choose organic , we are going to have to ensure that what they buy is actually organic . #% Unfortunately we have not yet ratified the Aarhus Convention in my own country , the Republic of Ireland , unlike most of our neighbours in the EU . #% I should like to draw your attention to paragraph 9 , which says that Parliament ` believes that the Members of the European Parliament who are part of the EC delegation have an essential contribution to make and expects , therefore , that they will have access to EU coordination meetings in Punta del Este on the basis at least of observer status ' . #% Mr President , I am pleased indeed that Commissioners Lamy and Fischler will be going to Tokyo for the mini-ministerial with an approved position . #% I should like to point out to the Commissioner that he meddles in the tax affairs of Member States at his peril . #% Could I remind my colleague , Jonathan Evans , that the decision in Lisbon was for the most competitive European economy in the world based on social inclusion , social cohesion and territorial cohesion . #% All that has been gained is that this issue ends up in conciliation and brings us no nearer to achieving the real goal of securing information and consultation for the employees of the European Union over the running of their companies . #% Not only have southern African countries been unwilling to exert pressure on Mr Mugabe , they have also allowed him to dictate the terms of Africa 's relationship with Europe , and that is worse . #% Finally , an important element of this debate should be the future of EU production . #% In relation to Laos , we call on the authorities to release political prisoners and prisoners of conscience , develop a multi-party system where all views and opinions can be taken into account , respect religious minorities and their rights and allow UN agencies unrestricted access to all parts of the country . #% 
It is essential that recognition , not only of third countries ' systems and procedures , but also of their continued compliance , be , for a substantial initial period of time , strictly monitored at European level , as such recognition will be global in nature . #% It has broad support from social platforms and civil society . #% The Greek Presidency is also making illegal immigration in Europe a priority . #% We have in Mr Barroso the ideal candidate . #% I would say to the Commissioner , please accept our amendments in relation to this area . #% Let us stick to the facts . #% It would be good if communism could co-exist with religious beliefs , and people should have the right to express their religious beliefs if they live in a communist country . #% Under the Irish presidency , Minister Roche set up a working group in the Council to look for better ways in which to inform citizens of the benefits of Europe . #% I suppose , very much like motherhood and apple pie , everybody in the European Union , the Member States , all the political groupings , rhetorically at least , share a commitment to social solidarity , social justice , social cohesion . #% Mr President , I come to this debate with divided loyalties . #% I would ask the President-in-Office to foster a coalition of nuclear-free states within the European Union . #% First of all , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response . #% The motion insists on the protection of the population of Western Sahara generally and in a manner consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , specifically in the area of freedom of expression and freedom of movement and calls for any final political resolution to be consistent with international law and the relevant UN Security Council resolution . #% But there are dangers relating not just to individual actions taken by Member States but also to the question of tax harmonisation , about increasing taxation . #% However , several studies have revealed the long-term limitations of this arrangement . #% He has done an outstanding job in establishing the role and function of the Ombudsman as the first person to hold this important post . #% These organisations in fact pay for membership of EWL and they do not have permanent financial aid available to them . #% Strategically , air transport is of critical importance , particularly for peripheral regions and islands such as Ireland . #% in writing . - The draft regulation is intended to ensure that third-country nationals who are legally resident within the EU and are in a cross-border situation concerning at least two Member States are subject to the same rules for coordinating social security entitlements as EU nationals under the abovementioned regulations . #% As a European federalist without reservation , I have every confidence in the Irish Government in its intention to help guide and develop this Community in every possible way for the benefit of its citizens . #% As I have repeatedly said , without the core business of farming most rural development projects can not be successful , because they can not stand alone . #% Something which concerns me greatly - and I mentioned it during the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy 's debate - is the use by some nuclear utilities of contract workers for the more dangerous aspects of decommissioning and accident work . #% We must try to rebuild this relationship as a matter of urgency . #% I would like to put on record my disappointment at Mr Allister 's comment on Mrs de Brún speaking a language ` no one cares to understand ' . #% In the short time available to me I wish to correct a remark made yesterday in plenary by my constituency colleague , Ms McKenna , and reported in the Irish Times today . #% There can be no peace without justice . #% The great prize which it offers is political and security stability across the wider continent . #% We believe in a strong Europe , we believe in a strong Commission and we believe we should be natural allies - let us work to that end . #% It is a pity that the US has not lived up to its responsibilities . #% Mr President , I welcome this report and the three main elements to it , of which we are already aware . #% We need to get to grips with the United States and persuade them that a law-based world order is far better than a Pax Americana . #% The 290 million citizens within the existing 11 EMU countries have the right to know what the European Central Bank intends to do to maintain and enhance the value of the euro now and into the future . #% The Sellafield complex in Cumbria has been the largest emitter of radiation in the UK , discharging radioactive gas and liquid into the Irish Sea . #% Mr Chichester recognises the limited role Parliament can play in energy policy , given that it is essentially a Member State competence . #% The Railway Infrastructure Package agreed by the Transport Council last December was the result of some very difficult negotiations . #% . -- Mr President , I will start my presentation on promoting more environmentally friendly fishing methods by reminding Parliament that in recent times fishermen collectively have been seriously under attack . #% I also believe it is important that Kosovo leaders speak out clearly against the violence that is taking place in the former Republic of Yugoslavia . #% I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety , Mr Byrne . #% We can not have a race to the back of the queue as Member States scurry to avoid attracting outside investment for fear of getting a rap on the knuckles from Brussels . #% I was prevented myself from going there . #% However , it has to be acknowledged from the outset that there is little the EU can do to resolve the situation . #% The Exchequer has collected EUR 3.5 million since March this year . #% We know the people of Europe want high-quality public services , we know they want them at an affordable price and they want them delivered universally . #% There is nothing whatsoever in this storm in a teacup that is trying to be wrapped up by the Social Democrats against Commissioner McCreevy . #% In the last month alone , there were two cases where three Latvian workers and four Polish workers were killed in two separate road accidents . #% A failure to do so would effect our attitude to their eventual accession . #% On the issue of uptake Mr Gallagher is perfectly correct : the uptake is not a reason for trying to slow things down . #% The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community . #% I hope the IGC will redress this anomaly . #% Commissioner , we welcome the efforts you have made and the backing you have had to get this implemented . #% In addition , employees of the institutions called on to testify must speak ` in accordance with the instructions from their administrations and shall continue to be bound by their duty of professional secrecy ' . #% I would now like to turn to some of the key provisions of the agreement . #% However , no credible measures are proposed to improve scientific knowledge even though the shortcomings in this area are well recognised . #% The Agreement is a vital tool in ensuring that the EU is well equipped to combat illegal , unreported and unregulated ( IUU ) fishing in our waters . #% We can not inhabit the weird minds of terrorists , but we can pay the high cost of protection . #% We are debating human rights issues right across the world and we can not ignore what happens in our own Member States . #% Amnesty International has estimated that almost 2 , 000 people were arrested for political reasons in Burma last year . #% When will action be taken to protect the citizens of the UK , as well as the citizens of Ireland and elsewhere ? #% The public needs to know , the national parliaments need to know and the European Parliament needs to know the debate that is going on in the Intergovernmental Conference . #% However , it is unfortunate that the Russian authorities - the health and agricultural inspectorates - were giving mixed signals with regard to the issue of meat imports into Russia from the European Union and trying to divide the unity that exists within the European Union concerning the whole question of health and food safety , after we fought long and hard within the Union to create a common standard of good quality and guaranteed quality produce . #% This morning when we were discussing the Lamassoure report on the competences of the European Union and defining the competences , I thought that we should from time to time re-examine the various competences of the Union . #% We need to look at this situation urgently . #% Some progress has been made for some people with some disabilities . #% The European Commission has already given approval for marketing support to small regional airports because of their importance in creating tourism and economic development . #% In the UK , the legacy of a Conservative government is an acute shortage of doctors . #% However , we should not allow such a high failure rate to discourage us in our efforts to create new jobs in what has been a much neglected area up to now . #% 
The whole globe shares the same ozone layer . #% As far as Cyprus is concerned , I am glad that Cyprus has made considerable progress and that it has been recommended to us . #% Is it soft law or hard law ? #% Do we have a view on the psychological impact , not just on farmers , but on the entire EU population , young and old , of the non-stop display on our television screens of truckloads of dead and decomposing animals ? #% If we fail to act quickly we can anticipate humanitarian disaster in the Balkans next winter . #% We need Europe-wide action and the involvement not just of the police and politicians but also of the Football Association , clubs , and the fans themselves . #% Recent developments in the United States are alarming indeed , but we can not allow experimentation with , or a market in , human life . #% Four European treaties in less than 15 years have resulted in many undoubted European successes : the single market , the euro , the accession of eastern European countries , rising environmental standards , greater equality between women and men , and anti-poverty and full employment strategies , to name but a few . #% Because people do not necessarily agree with every word that others say , this does not mean that they have no right to say it . #% The investigation is focusing in part on the possible payments of secret commissions to intermediaries with a view to securing contracts . #% If the revision of the TEN guidelines were to concentrate just on existing bottlenecks as announced by the Commission in its work programme for the year 2000 , this would focus the funding on the more economically developed central regions of the Union , perhaps to the detriment of the outermost regions . #% We all wish the IGC could have concluded in December . #% But you are doing yourselves and this House a disservice by shooting the messenger , which is what you are doing here . #% We must remember that the CAP is not just for farmers : it provides us with a safe and secure food supply and wide-ranging public goods and environmental benefits . #% But , if you are going to bring this scheme in it has to be mandatory and it has to be introduced in every Member State . #% If we look at the dates of the various pieces of legislation that Mr Cashman has mentioned in his report , we see that they are all at least 30 years old . #% I also note my disappointment that Fianna Fáil TDs voted against this modest motion on media ownership in Italy . #% The aim of the new centre is to overcome the problems of the present arrangements and to develop and implement projects more coherently across the territories of what will be the 25 Member States of the EU . #% I thank in particular the Nigerian Ambassador to Ireland , His Excellency Mr Elias Nathan , who has publicly appealed for mercy on behalf of this mother . #% The kind of conditions they have to endure in large vessels are not acceptable , so if new vessels are being built we should ensure that the best standards possible are complied with and that measures are taken to ensure that , where live animals must be transported by sea in large vessels , all measures are taken to optimise conditions for them . #% Sound , factual information is in the best interests of the industry . #% I believe that the internal market will benefit most from a joint and coordinated approach by all three institutions to improving the entire regulatory cycle . #% To the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government and the many hundreds of civil servants who have been involved we say a very sincere thank you and we are very proud of you for a job well done . #% Mr President , I would like first of all to congratulate you on your wonderful statement with regard to the celebration of International Women 's Day . #% Countries - particularly Belgium - are in breach of human rights standards . #% As far as research and development is concerned , let me be positive . #% in writing . - I am opposed to nuclear fission power on the principle of safety , while I support ongoing research into the potential of nuclear fusion as a possible safer alternative in the longer term . #% Many colleagues have also raised questions about the desirability of separating the ex ante responsibility for budget control from the ex post responsibility for budget implementation or formulation within the Commission . #% The rapporteur has advanced the options of charging Heavy Goods Vehicles ( HGVs ) for the pollution they cause and including noise pollution caused by rail transport under the provisions of the report . #% Mr President , along the same lines as Mr Allister , I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that , during the summer , we witnessed the return to Dublin -- to the Republic of Ireland -- of the so-called Colombia Three . #% I also hope that the Commission will understand from this debate tonight that we are not willing , as a Parliament , to lie down and be walked over by anyone . #% You can not have a dialogue when one side does not explain its reasoning for what it is doing . #% The Member States , as well as the Commission , have clear responsibilities in this area . #% But to fail to provide information requested by the Commission under Article 10 of the Treaty in a timely and proper manner is inexcusable . #% Nuclear energy in the United States has cost US$ 1 trillion , one million million dollars . #% This is what we need to do : to assess if what we now have is an improvement or otherwise . #% They can not afford not to work ; they need the two salaries to pay the mortgage . #% On the other side , there is the current Prime Minister Abhisit and his party , who represent other sections of the elite . #% In particular , we must think of the women and children , whose suffering is not something that has occurred just because of the Hamas takeover in Gaza , or just because of a lack of negotiation between the Palestinian and the Israeli authorities , or just because of the cancellation of aid from the European Union and the US ; their suffering goes back 30 years . #% The fact that it remains in place is a good thing , as also that it can be altered and changed to adapt to changing circumstances . #% In the Thyssen report Parliament has made it clear that it wants to see an extended impact study in this area . #% The Commission should provide much more resources because the task that they are doing will certainly improve the lot of fishermen throughout the EU . #% How decisions are made is all-important . #% We would welcome that . #% In so doing , we must ensure that we show the deepest respect to the different religious traditions in this country and to this ancient civilisation which has contributed so much to the world . #% Peripheral and island regions have their own specific and geographic characteristics which require European Union responses , particularly with regard to infrastructure and employment needs . #% Only in this way can fact rather than fiction govern our decisions on food law and food safety in the future . #% The basic objective of the 6 to 12 miles coastal zone regime was to protect fishery resources by reserving access to small scale coastal fishery activities . #% Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this . #% It is not just a catastrophe , it is also a man-made tragedy . #% In this case , as in so many other policy areas , the EU has touched in a positive way on every aspect of the lives of our citizens . #% But I also believe that we have a responsibility to seek to improve the draft directive presented to us , a view shared unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% The present system , whereby there is at least one Commissioner from each Member State , has worked well in the past and should be maintained . #% Mr President , it is very clear that there has to be clear labelling . #% Please tell us what the options are and where you stand on this , Commissioner . #% We must not interfere with the rights of individuals to a fair defence , trial , or prejudice the doctrine of presumed innocence . #% While we want to be positive about many of the changes that are taking place in China , we can not , and indeed must not , turn a blind eye to the continuing abuse of human rights , in particular the scandalous treatment of political dissidents and members of religious faiths . #% The cold-blooded murder of an Irish journalist , my friend Veronica Guerin , by one of our drug barons whose identity is known but who is evading prosecution is only one recent case . #% Could I ask that Mr Prodi be given the opportunity to come and explain in more detail his views on these very sensitive issues , because interference or ill-judged comment at this stage will not be helpful if we want to get the present constitutional treaty through in the 15 Member States , let alone in the 25 . #% Both the US and Japan are pulling out of this research completely . #% It is , however , important that the Commission addresses some of the concerns of Members of the European Parliament and of my political group on the issue of sales below cost in particular . #% We have all got to work together to overcome this problem and prevent the civil unrest and misery that could arise from it . #% There is a happy medium and a balance between both , which must be maintained . #% Equally , it will ensure that the common agricultural policy will be properly financed and that many social and regional aid schemes will continue for the poorer Member States of the Union after 1999 . #% Similarly , installation aid for young farmers is a key component in ensuring the future of farming , particularly in the more isolated regions which have a structure of small family farms . #% That is how we need to do our business , to put a drive , a focus and an energy behind it . #% 
Some years ago , the Chief Rabbi in Britain , Jonathan Sachs , wrote a book called . #% However , as I said , women work , and we must do our best to at least ensure that if someone other than the primary care-giver is taking care of the child below the age of two years nine months , that it is someone who can give the child as nurturing a care as possible . #% Democracy depends on the public being informed . #% Extra-territorial legislation to convict those who travel abroad to abuse children is absolutely vital . #% Mr President , I think Members should realise what an excellent negotiator we had in Pascal Lamy . #% The report also reflects the massive amount of work required in this area if we are to bridge the gap between rhetoric and reality . #% Mr President , I also want to congratulate Mr Pettinari on his report . #% A lot of vessels are used for transporting live animals . #% There now exists in Ireland a total absence of any trust in relation to reassurances about the safety of the nuclear plant in Sellafield . #% We are committed to limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases to 13 % above our 1990 levels by the year 2010 or so . #% As a Member of the European Parliament , representing Leinster , which is along the Irish Sea , I am deeply concerned at these revelations . #% Nature is a very powerful force . #% Madam President , I want to point out that this report basically accepts the whole idea of globalization , the internal market , absolute free trade and the free movement of capital . #% What specific steps does he have in mind to safeguard against private entrepreneurs creaming off the easy and the profitable aspects of the postal services , whilst leaving rural residents as the poor relations ? #% Legislation governing the health and safety of workers throughout the EU is a prime example of how the EU has made and can make a positive contribution to raising the quality of life for millions of the Union 's citizens . #% I submit , therefore , that we need a specific directive in relation to any potential water pollution in the aquaculture sector . #% If consumer confidence is to be restored , Britain must implement an eradication programme that will leave no doubts in the minds of consumers . #% Does the President-in-Office agree that rural tourism must be prioritised in the context of the broader EU tourism package and that agri-tourism must be promoted and developed as a means of sustaining farm families and rural communities ? #% I fully agree on the need to simplify the administrative procedures and to make the programmes more accessible and relevant to national agencies and participants , in particular the proposal to develop the Symmetry information management system . #% It is not a question of interfering with the Commission 's right of initiative in relation to the treaties , but a question of quality control . #% I shall refer to the European Union 's response to that shortly . #% It does not propose a specific solution to these questions as such and it does not suggest that global regulation should be introduced for the Internet or that new international entities should be created . #% This need is also a result of the establishment of OLAF and indeed the fact that , quite shortly , we are hopefully going to ratify a constitution which contains a charter of citizens ' rights and which will clearly enhance the role of the citizen in Europe . #% I hope our officials , ministers and others who agreed to the targets and timetables did so realistically , because we should not commit ourselves to something we can not deliver . #% The only Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms which can be utilised in the Member State courts or even in the Court of Justice , as authoritative rather than binding , is the European Convention on Human Rights which is a Council of Europe document . #% The fact that 1.7 million citizens have died as a result of sanctions and bombings since the Gulf War makes one wonder how much a barrel of oil is worth . #% Mr President , sorry for taking up your time but I just want to put on the record as a point of order my objection to the fact that on the agenda for this week we have Question Time to the Commission at 5.30 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon and at the same time we also have committee meetings . #% As I see it , we have a good piece of legislation : the framework directive requesting employers to mitigate health risks for employees . #% I hope they will , because there is a clear need for a long-term constitutional framework for the new Europe of 25 countries , which may well become even larger during this decade . #% As mentioned earlier , many organisations are eligible for this funding . #% Finally , I welcome the Dublin Declaration on Employment . #% But what about a bigger industry , the Irish beef industry , which will not be allowed to stand in the way of global corporate farming either ? #% Madam President , we know what this is about : basically it is a technical debate . #% And please , tell us what your many benchmarking exercises have shown . #% But there would be some amusement in some of the more rural parts of Ireland at the tone of the debate . #% Through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service known as MABS in Ireland , they provide access to credit for individuals who are often seriously in debt and otherwise prey to illegal money lenders providing loans at impossibly high interest rates . #% It is also important to tighten up the definition of `` self-employed '' . #% Streamlining VAT procedures for these businesses will enhance efficiency and encourage increased activity within the internal market , feeding to the Lisbon Agenda , which is supposed to be the focus and aim for all of us at the moment . #% Ireland is presently experiencing strong economic growth and part of our resources must be invested in alternative waste management schemes . #% We accept the importance of a debate in Parliament on food safety but the proposal made was for an urgent debate on the question of whether a Member State has the right to decide for itself in accordance not with Community policy but with what suits its own political aspirations at a particular time . #% Average EU tariffs are now less than 4 % , while some industrial tariffs in Asia and South America are as high as 30 % . #% The Irish people will resolve their own problems . #% As is indicated in our question , the committee certainly believes that the online problem-solving network can find pragmatic and rapid solutions , which do not have to end up in the courts or as infringement cases . #% This system has served Europe well and can , if correctly used , eradicate BSE completely from the British herd . #% It is quite absurd to have two separate Treaties dealing with something as fundamental and complicated as energy . #% The question of the Structural Funds has to be looked at in depth . #% They are in my prayers . #% I hope Mr Trichet will be in a position to respond to this report and , in particular - not today , but perhaps over a certain period - to consider my suggestion about an ECB formula to equate with the Fed formula so that there can be a true and accurate measure of the likely knock-on effect of interest rate increases on house prices in the Member States of the eurozone . #% I appreciate the honourable Member 's kind compliment . #% The situation changed again in September 1998 with the elections and change of government , so the application has been reactivated and is before us again this evening . #% It would be very difficult to water and feed those animals unless the vehicle is equipped to make that possible . #% In relation to coastal zones it is extremely important . #% We should not jump to any rash conclusions about the need for the harmonization of tax in order to create equality of competition . #% Mr President , this is an extremely interesting debate . #% Sri Lanka depends for its economic recovery on foreign direct investment and on EU economic support . #% I can not understand the priority it has been given , but I accept that there is a general need to have harmonisation at upper safe levels . #% The export of small arms in particular to third countries which do not uphold values of democracy and human rights creates greater instability , not just in the regions to which the arms are exported , but for the world as a whole . #% What we need is both a marketing sales ban and a testing ban and we must do that now . #% Mrs Malone is quite correct when she says that our birth rate is rising but , unfortunately , it is rising in areas where the children do not have the best possible advantages for the future . #% Nuclear safety in the enlargement process is a major cause for concern . #% Farmers who are , in the main , the custodians and managers of the landscape are responding in a positive manner by conforming with changing environmental guidelines , many of which have a cost factor for which they deserve to be compensated . #% This is due , at least in part , to the conflicting nature of some of the objectives of the CFP as laid down in Regulation 3760/92 . #% I do not want to say or do anything which might upset negotiations which are at a delicate stage and where the Council will endeavour to take a common position within two weeks . #% The conditions in the prisons have to be addressed ; also access of prisoners to basic human rights , access of NGOs to Indonesia , freedom of the press , freedom of movement of people , and the right of people to live in a society where they are not persecuted by their own government . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I shall be brief . #% Finally , fanatical terrorism is difficult to defeat , but we must be prepared to be determined and vigorous in the counter-terrorism measures that we introduce . #% 
That is not acceptable . #% Is there a difference between DG Enterprise and DG Environment on this issue , and has DG Enterprise won the battle ? #% Smaller Member States must be strongly represented within the overall EU institutional structure . #% I am absolutely amazed that the Commission and Council can so easily agree on taking away the role of Parliament . #% This would , I believe , be the remit of the Commission and I would expect that to be the intention . #% Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States . #% I look forward to seeing these reflected in the final regulation . #% The European Union must aim for greater coordination of employment policies and a growthorientated macro-economic policy . #% I appreciate his very open and honest attitude to this . #% As far as the mobile air conditioning or MAC Directive is concerned , I am of the opinion that a balance has to be struck between , on the one hand , being technology-prescriptive in relation to the global warming potential of the gases to be allowed according to the directive and , on the other hand , promoting the development of alternative environmental technologies . #% Our efforts to combat ` brain drain ' and establish a ` brain network ' will be enhanced by proposals which minimise bureaucratic obstacles and increase social security support for researchers . #% I find it bizarre that at the beginning of the 21st century we are still arguing for common sense with regard to health and safety . #% There are millions of Muslims living within the Union who are fully integrated within our societies and who contribute positively to the development of the European Union . #% In this regard , I wish to say to the Council that my Group deplores the continued failure by the Council to agree a legal base for a financial protocol with Turkey . #% Pro-democracy campaigners and political activists are often detained without charge and , in some cases , charged with inciting subversion . #% If it is not accurately reported , then you should immediately correct it . #% Last week , in Brussels , we heard the Commission 's latest economic forecasts and on the basis of these projections , Commissioner de Silguy told us that up to eleven Member States will take part in EMU from January 1999 . #% They will have to fend for themselves , because governments will not have the money , after privatising their nations ' resources , to satisfy large corporate interests . #% An early step will no doubt be the revision of the investment services directive which provides for the possibility of choice of systems for post-trading activity . #% Key to these directives is that the requirements we are now laying down are stricter than those laid down by the SOLAS 90 Convention , thereby ensuring that accidents of the magnitude we have experienced in the European Community will be much less likely to happen again . #% The European Union itself , as I have said before - given that it is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution - might begin by creating a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation , backed up by a department of peace and reconciliation , which could be sent to areas of conflict with the principles of conflict resolution that are the heart of the European Union . #% This is an old story . #% Developed countries must take the first meaningful steps in reducing emissions . #% This trade is worth over EUR 150 million annually . #% I would end by saying to the President-in-Office that the jury is out , the ball is in his court and that he has all our support . #% The reality is that very few young people kick the habit of smoking during their lives . #% That is why we , as Socialists , have asked for the European Parliament to be associated with the anti-dumping investigation , for Parliament to have a role in terms of transparency and accountability , and not for the Commission to take unaccountable decisions counter to subsidiarity . #% The main purpose of granting aid is poverty reduction . #% We know what the barriers are to accepting such a common sense solution . #% Firstly , more than EUR 2 billion came from revenue . #% Neither the `` no '' campaign nor the `` yes '' campaign made an issue of enlargement . #% This is now the codecision procedure on the regulation which implements that agreement . #% As parliamentarians we should have acknowledged Green Week and the biodiversity loss focus by having a debate on that issue . #% However , the value of the benefit in changing a microchip identification number in a pet animal is unlikely to ever be so great as to warrant the effort and the cost involved . #% It is for this reason that I really welcome last week 's decision by the Commission . #% We have set out our solutions in paragraph 44 . #% If we are serious about the attainment of equality , we must , on an ongoing basis , not only guarantee equality of opportunity across those categories , but we must be in a position to measure accurately and adequately outcomes as against each of those categories . #% In other words we can get more from the carrot than from the stick . #% That is why it is important that there be a review of cooperation so that we can determine how the resources of the European Union and the Member States can best be deployed . #% We believe that ab initio this kind of process , which , as I said , was a minority pursuit , to be a sign of weakness and not of strength . #% We need to give them the skills and training that they require to work in the so-called digital economy . #% We must remember this and similar cases and the plight of all women under Sharia law in the African continent . #% So the long arm of the European Union 's excess capacity reaches out even as far as there . #% I was disappointed to note that certain Member States continue to oppose the inclusion of a chapter on employment policy in the new Treaty . #% The European Union is an evolving Union , it will only evolve as far as the Treaties allow it to evolve . #% I have to ask how long will the European Union and the United Nations drag their feet and stand back before they increase the pressure for the early release of those held in prison ? #% Canada 's tar sands have become a playground for big oil companies like BP , Total and Shell . #% Mr President , I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for his ongoing and diligent work on this issue which may not grab the headlines , but is of extreme importance to each and every one of the people that we represent here in this Parliament . #% The rapporteur 's proposal for regular progress reports on joint actions will lead to ongoing evaluation , thus ensuring maximum value in respect of funding and , more importantly , greater effectiveness of the programmes themselves . #% People are moving across borders to take up jobs , some people are retiring to other areas and an increasing number of people are working for periods in other Member States . #% To be condemned to death by stoning for having a child out of wedlock is a breach of internationally agreed human rights . #% Secondly , is it possible to remove the blockages which have been put in place because of dependence on Article 235 by Member States , particularly in programmes that relate directly to alleviating the poverty traps which disabled people have fallen into because of the lack of work at national level ? #% I am surprised that they continue to charge supplements to single people who sometimes simply find it difficult to afford this . #% I hope that in Göteborg the Council will find the wisdom lacking in the statement of the General Affairs Council to include the European Commission in the search for a way forward . #% The two directives were very carefully calculated to ensure that there would not be huge and sudden job losses - approximately 250,000 jobs have been lost in this sector , with more to come - and secondly to allow those Member States which had invested heavily in , for example , nuclear energy to do some strategic planning and not leave them with too much in the way of stranded costs . #% We would like to see that happen during the Irish presidency and we would like to see the Commission come on board too . #% Now I understand that one Member State - although perhaps I am being unfair in this - raised some objection to that . #% She obviously listened during the debates in the committee on her report and has incorporated many of the ideas which came up . #% I am very confident that , if proposals are included in this plan to deal with our waste problem in a novel manner , the European Commission will financially support alternative waste-disposal methods during the next round of EU Structural Funds . #% It is essential to find a balance between the needs of the fishing industry , the management of resources and the needs of the people who make their living from fishing and its associated industries . #% The danger is that when the EU bureaucracy and red tape get to work , the system that emerges could be unwieldy , excessively burdensome and very expensive . #% They want to support the young producers and directors who are making these programmes , very often grossly under-financed . #% For the past 25 years I have been a Member of this House , elected at the top of the poll from Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , with your permission and having discussed this with Mrs Hassi , who tabled this amendment , and indeed my colleague Mrs Corbey of the PSE Group , I would like colleagues to consider a very brief oral amendment . #% I would like to appeal to all groups in this House to lend their support to the package of amendments now proposed and let us from Thursday onward ensure that we transcend partisanship , if some perceive it to have existed . #% It is a sensible and workable decision , through which we have limited the scope of this directive . #% 
It then took the Irish Government six months to apply for the EGF , and seven more to answer to the Commission 's request for clarifications . #% We place a very strong emphasis in the Liberal Group - and I am glad to say the rapporteur will take our only amendment to this report - on recalling the necessity as we develop our thesis about universality of service , quality of service and so on - and these issues are extremely important - of not abandoning our commitment - and , indeed , the treaty requirement - to have regard to competition . #% I think people need to be told that the European Union is an unprecedented success , compared with anything that went before at any time in history , following unprecedented consultation . #% Like its predecessor , the Constitution , it foundered on the rock of democracy . #% We need millions of people to make decisions which do not seem obvious to them . #% The Irish people are well capable of looking after themselves . #% They refuse to admit that they subsidise their agriculture in a much less transparent way than we do . #% In Ireland , we have our own problems with media ownership that we must regulate . #% I should like to thank the rapporteur for grasping the importance of the information technologies in reducing the environmental burden of development actions , for example by reducing the need for mobility or the need for transport infrastructures . #% In the past , high profile genocidal outrages like Srebrenica provoked sufficient anger to galvanise the international community into action . #% Children spend their whole education in Portakabins . #% It is also welcome that the Council agreement in Brussels in October 2002 brought stability and predictability to farmer spending up to 2013 . #% Procedures for establishing Houses of Europe in all Member States are under way . #% Please answer me , but do not tell me that as President-in-Office you had no option but to negotiate on behalf of the EU . #% The role of legislators and their enactment and enforcement of food and public health regulations are also central to a safe food industry . #% It wants a specific directive on clearing , on the one hand , and settlement on the other , laying down common rules on authorisations , supervision and a common framework amongst others . #% Despite considerable advantages in using renewable energy sources , consumption remains at below 6 % in the Union . #% There will be enormous benefit to both Europe and Korea on the signing of this deal . #% I agree with the rapporteur that as the single biggest donor we would like to see the Commission fly the flag more often . #% My group supports the resolution . #% The events that led to Robert McCartney 's murder show clearly the collusion that occurred . #% Mr President , behaviour which is apparently irrational usually has an explanation . #% I said to Commissioner Flynn last year and I am repeating it here to you , Taoiseach , that I want to see us getting to the point where unemployment is at the bottom of our agenda , not because we are not interested in solving it , but because it has been solved . #% I trust that both my colleagues in this Chamber and those working throughout the European institutions will consider these principles in the years ahead . #% A political group , the Referendum Party , that is a meaningless party in Britain , is interfering in internal Irish politics . #% I , along with other Members in the House , have full confidence in the Commission ensuring that there is an innovative and new way of guaranteeing security for this domain in the future . #% Continued rural development in my country is therefore vital . #% I was beginning to wonder if I was the Euro-sceptic or was he ? #% As Jim Nicholson stated , the situation is exaggerated in Northern Ireland and the UK because of the strength of sterling and there is a new and very obvious reluctance by young people to embark on agriculture as a career . #% The most important of these issues for Ireland related to improved market access , or the reduction of import tariffs . #% But it is equally important to bring the governments of the Member States along with us , because , as has been seen from the use of Article 235 , certain governments felt this was an imposition on them , and that it interfered with their democratic rights under the rules of subsidiarity within the Treaties . #% The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution : the first half of the last century was the worst in the history of the world -- 50 million dead . #% Farmers , especially those in major exporting areas such as Ireland , have suffered tremendous losses . #% Is it not clear that the EU undermines its credibility as regards taking a stand on international terrorism if it acquiesces in Member States harbouring wanted and convicted international terrorists ? #% I believe that we as legislators have a duty first and foremost to ensure the highest standards of public health protection . #% I therefore agree that the discharge should be given for 1995 . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome our Taoiseach , Mr Bruton , here and congratulate the Irish presidency , including our civil servants , on the hard work they have put in . #% It is not something that has been copied from some other model . #% The bottom line with regard to the reconstruction of Iran from an EU perspective is the following : it is going to take months and years to reconstruct the city and help to rebuild the lives of thousands of people which have simply been destroyed by this horrific earthquake . #% We have to remind all the peoples of Europe that our best self-interest , as well as our best collective interest , lies in understanding our interdependency , not only in relation to single market economics , but also to our human responsibilities to each other across the European continent . #% Israel , as a democratic state , needs to ask itself questions . #% The provision of and access to such services is the essence of what sustainable rural development is all about . #% The Liberal Group , however , is disappointed with the sluggish and begrudging progress to date on a number of the liberalization dossiers , especially in telecommunications and postal services . #% It will be the Irish taxpayers who will pay the penalties ! #% I wish to give my wholehearted support to the McCartney family in their quest for justice for their brother Robert . #% Those three levels are complementary and Parliament , being the only institution directly elected by the European citizens , should strive to have a greater say in all three of them . #% Secondly , we are in favour of helping the people around the world who are dependent on growing drug crops because of the economic conditions in their own countries . #% Member States must be obliged to communicate new legislation to citizens once it is agreed . #% Tax competition within the European Union has been healthy for growth and has been beneficial and of assistance . #% Mr President , I welcome this report on organic food and farming . #% Increased worker participation helps to achieve a happier , more highly motivated and more productive workforce . #% Technically it covers the period up to 30 June 2002 , but since Parliament is not going to do a report on the final situation as at 31 December , I will make some comments on the situation up to that date . #% Many new Member States have been pressing the Commission for some time to deal with the availability problem , taking particular account of the unique situation of horses . #% We also have a recent RPII report , which I would recommend the Commission to study . #% Perhaps here we see the long arm of Mr Blair , but the falsification of such data is of concern to Europe . #% I thank the Minister for his consideration in undertaking to reply to the questions in writing . #% We can not have a situation such as that which arose this summer , when the sale of 80 to 90 million items of clothing and textiles was blocked in the warehouses of Europe , paralysing European businesses and damaging their trade relations with Chinese counterparts . #% This example has already been proven in certain areas by voluntary agreements in Irish waters and by maintenance of these non-fishing areas - so-called set-aside areas , to give the analogy with the common agricultural policy - for a certain period of time . #% They are living in the past , looking through rose-tinted glasses and looking back to a time that no longer exists . #% While the number of incidents proportionate to the volume of quality food produced is minimal , the negative impact on consumers is considerable . #% I welcome the compromise reached and support the provisions relating to the possible lifting of the feed ban , because the provision is based on sound science . #% That is why I welcome the presence of Mr Prodi at this early stage and the dialogue we start . #% The welfare of our animals deserves regulation that is based on best scientific practice . #% When Ireland joined the European Union it had 59 % of the Community average . #% Junior doctors play a critical role in patient care . #% Both of those propositions are utterly discredited and if you look at the figures for poverty , for homelessness and for social dislocation in this Union , you will understand why . #% 
Furthermore , I believe it is of utmost importance that the region of AJK has proper representation in the Pakistani Government , which it does not yet have . #% The report examines how universal , accessible and affordable health care systems can be set up and how we can share best practice from the European experience . #% In Ireland the Commission is regarded as an honest broker - someone who can always help when there are delicate textual and substantial political issues to be considered . #% Under the next CAP , the excessive bureaucratic burden on livestock farmers must be addressed and reduced . #% Mr President , a feature of the current situation is the anger and the frustration of the men and women of all our Member States . #% Nations , cities , towns and most of all people are the victims of terrorism . #% We can not undermine this policy in order to create or finance another objective . #% Mr President , I would like to ask the Commission when they propose to deal with the report which was commissioned by DG XIV - reference PEM/306 - concerning the physical interaction between grey seals , fishing gear and the abnormal predatory conditions of the seals in the North Atlantic , the North-West Atlantic and now penetrating into the South Atlantic . #% The Commission and the Council sought to change the status of the workers in that Foundation and we had to negotiate considerably to try and find a solution to that . #% The Irish navy has the responsibility of policing some 20 % of EU coastal waters . #% Rather than repeat some of the comments made about these reforms , I just want to say that I have some concern about the severity of the price cut . #% This should also be reflected in EU competition policy . #% If you are not going to invest capital in new machinery , in training , in new plant , in new equipment and so on , how do you expect to employ more people ? #% Sweden spends EUR 200 per person as a proportion of GDP , compared to EUR 100 in Ireland , yet Sweden is the third most competitive economy in the world , compared to Ireland 's position at 26th . #% That is not under debate , although those matters should be debated in the UK and elsewhere . #% But when those elements are set , it is the role of the Central Bank to call the monetary policy mix , and we need not at this stage reopen old debates . #% There is a clear need to lay down a strict , enforceable framework of rules governing the nature of the products we are discussing . #% I have some concerns about an overbureaucratic system coming into place because , at the very least , there would be more documentation required of Member States . #% We all recognise that this is an ambitious timeframe , but it is one that can be met . #% In fact , a trinity of events has taken place which has guaranteed that the pace of EU enlargement has accelerated and is now an unstoppable process . #% In short , there is need for more research #% The proposed directive , which requires an environmental assessment before the adoption of a regional or county plan , makes good environmental and economic sense . #% This combination means that there would be a minimum threshold of 500 combining with a Socialist upper threshold . #% It will be above the threshold and that would leave our current strategy in tatters . #% In the context of the WTO talks , I am concerned primarily about agriculture . #% I strongly support the reinforcement of the consent principle so as to give the maximum protection to donors . #% We must not allow recent events to continue , or ferment or destroy us . #% We must not underestimate the challenges we face in the run-up to the accession of the ten countries to the European Union . #% I hope this will have the wholehearted support of the House . #% They have been forced off their islands to live in exile in other places . #% I voted against the Brejc report for the very reasons that some of my colleagues have outlined . #% Many Irish workers would see that they are in that position at the moment . #% What are the options for implementation ? #% The promises made must be kept . #% That is why the Commission must take some sort of initiative to bring in legislation to ensure that this issue is wiped out . #% It matters because of the potential in our own European Union and in the whole of central and eastern Europe . #% in writing . - I support this report which seeks to extend EU maternity leave to 20 weeks on full pay and to introduce two weeks of paid paternity leave . #% I think the euro will succeed . #% Indeed , we are working towards achieving a ban on it . #% This will cause delays for many badly-needed projects throughout the European Union and in my country , Ireland . #% It is positive that the regulation avoids a one-size-fits-all approach . #% We need more flexibility to manage unforeseen changes in global trade . #% On behalf of the thousands of beef producers I want to appeal to the Commission and the British Government to act together to pay more attention to the real scientists and less to the biased commentators who are continuously getting it wrong . #% We are still only paying lip service to the whole area of energy efficiency , which has an enormous contribution to make . #% In his book , ` The European Dream ' , Jeremy Rifkin comments on the remarkable recovery of European countries following the Second World War . #% CITES is a global conservation agreement on trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna , which is implemented in the EU through the even stricter EU wildlife trade regulations . #% I would like to thank the rapporteurs on behalf of my group and on behalf of Parliament for the tremendous work that they have done on their joint reports . #% Last week a report by Mental Disability Rights International caused huge concern and outrage because it outlined serious abuses in Romanian institutions . #% Simplification is the key : not complication . #% We need to address it . #% We must cut the lifelines that are fuelling the destruction in Darfur , lifelines like Chinese oil money and Russian weapons . #% These funds will alleviate the obvious infrastructural deficit that occurs in regions like mine and indeed in other regions that are lagging behind in Europe . #% It is extremely important that we take note of the situation and seek to find emergency solutions because this is an emergency . #% It is essential that Member States pay for the cost of new security mechanisms and short-term special measures . #% It is also regrettable if the Irish presidency is being forced and pressurised into finding some agreement on this during its term of office . #% Why should this be agreed in view of the recent economic expansion there ? #% author . - Madam President , as an international socialist , I strongly defend the right of each individual to freedom of religious belief and practice , on the basis that the fundamental rights of others are not transgressed . #% However , I want to point out that in voting for the agreement and for the joint resolution , this is what the agreement says we are voting for : ' All participants to the agreement accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organizations ' . #% Everything is decided in Dublin at central government level . #% She did not come down on one side or the other or make any such suggestion . #% The CAP post 2013 should support active producers and reward them for the food they produce and the many public goods they provide to society - including high animal welfare and environmental standards . #% There was a very notable case where a German child had been abducted to Western Samoa and there were others abducted to France and North Africa . #% While the eradication of poverty is the primary development policy objective of the EU , many policy initiatives undercut this purpose . #% Commissioner , may I say ` more power to your elbow ! ' when you see the recalcitrant Member State in court , because we can not have one Member State playing a different game from the others . #% In Northern Ireland it has been discovered by the largest transport operation called Translink that 60 % of black smoke and 40 % of carbon monoxide has been wiped out by using this product . #% I would imagine that it will take at least a doubling of the present structural funds to finance a new regional policy for the new and wider Europe if we are not to create immense dissatisfaction in the countries which join and if we are not to alienate many of the citizens already in the Community . #% 
in writing . - The EU-US relationship is one of the most important relationships that the EU has . #% One of the most important issues we need to stress here tonight is that this Parliament has the ability , the innovation and indeed the skill to meet deadlines . #% I would like to wish you well for the future . #% Furthermore , bags and containers used for waste selection must also use the same colour codes and symbols in all the EU member countries . #% However , when it comes to the crunch -- when a treasury may face large claims -- does the regulator protect the market or protect the investor ? #% A consolidated tax base would have the effect of placing the fiscal policy of Member States into a straight jacket . #% I think it is good that tonight we are debating in less emotive terms than we would have ten years ago , but I would urge that people look at the science of the debate , rather than the emotion of the past , when they are voting on this very important report . #% Madam President , the Commissioner finished his speech by saying that not that many consequences can be drawn from this case . #% May I point out that the Moscow mechanism is not for the Council to use , it is for the OSCE to use . #% Anyone who has been subject to the lobbying from both sides in this debate will have heard convincing arguments for and against the common position proposed . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office a question in relation to this important issue that is before us today : would he look also at the Scotch-Irish language in Northern Ireland ? #% I say this having visited in the United States last week the Institute for Missing and Exploited Children . #% The Commission must implement all the recommendations in our report and this must be done efficiently and immediately . #% Today is a watershed in the reform of the European Commission . #% Secondly , transport workers : when we already have tachograph legislation in place , why do we need to bring in a separate and new directive on transport workers , in particular lorry drivers and so on ? #% While the Commission may not have been proactive enough to date in using its infringement powers , I hope that its recent case against Denmark will be a sign of things to come and will assuage the worst case scenario fears of industry with regard to the single market . #% Let me conclude by saying I welcome the speculation that the Feira Council will endorse the concept of a rapid reaction police force which would swing into action after completion of military tasks . #% Today in the budget vote we rejected three amendments that would have removed EU development funding from government and organisational programmes that included coercive abortion , involuntary sterilisation and infanticide . #% Currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed . #% These conditions are binding , however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period . #% Yes , there are issues relating to competition for self-employed , but this legislation will not deal with those matters . #% I am especially pleased with the inclusion of animal welfare . #% I am glad that has been tackled . #% It is really an important issue and , unless the Commission deals with it as a matter of priority , we are going to see a deepening crisis in Europe . #% This resulted in over 400 massacres in 1999 . #% It is deplorable that our own government is trying to force people to change their minds . #% Despite the fact that some of those issues continue to create difficulties , I believe that some progress has been made . #% They are entitled to have their taxes protected but the best way to protect the taxpayers and the taxpayers ' interests is at the national level . #% It is my belief that if the European Union is to work , we have to strengthen and deepen the relationships between this Parliament and the national parliaments . #% Quite truthfully , a lot of what Mr Titford said resonated very strongly with me . #% His detention is part of the most severe police crackdown in China in decades . #% I only have two points I want to make . #% Mr President , I should also like to congratulate Mr Sturdy on his report . #% Those who are concerned about human rights , animal welfare and the environment have a much better prospect of securing improvements in those areas within a legal framework and a World Trade Organisation than they have in a free-for-all , law of the jungle . #% In so doing he said : ` Linking cities and villages into this busy network will not only give new jobs to Ireland but will provide the one-stop media shop for local services in health , education , tourism , business development and all public services ' . #% So why generate a battle about some EUR 300 million that , in the end , I do not think that we will have to call down from agriculture ? #% The Cardiff Summit has been more a stocktaking exercise than one in which major decisions have been made . #% This package of proposals amounts to the most wide-ranging and fundamental examination of all the major political issues dealt with at European Union level : budget and financing , common policies , the process of enlargement , as well as the prospect of economic and social cohesion . #% As an exercise , I logged onto one of the more popular websites a few minutes before I came down here and I found 1.8 million references to citizenship . #% In view of the statement given by Commissioner Frattini during the debate on Monday and his commitment to look at the effects of this regulation and the civil justice laws for parties domiciled in third countries , in particular the States of the European Economic Area , the groups have agreed not to insist on Amendment 1 . #% The House will be aware that banks availed themselves of the transition period to cream off excessive exchange charges and , to some extent , this is still happening . #% It has been repeated here so often that is what is needed . #% We have to find a middle ground between those who see a need for a unipolar world and those who see the need for a multipolar world . #% On the issue of Palestine , I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement . #% We have to go back to the drawing board and ask ourselves what our priorities are . #% Some of those issues need clarification , and at the same time , the raison d'être of the development round are the needs of agriculture in developing countries where , proportionately , it is of far more importance than it is in the European Union . #% Mr President , my congratulations to Mrs Roth . #% Consensus building - which is at the centre of policies being pursued by the Greek Presidency - could not become a reality because of the polarised viewpoints on the war in Iraq taken by different countries in Europe . #% I voted against that agreement , which was blocked by Parliament out of concern for the privacy rights of European citizens and companies , put at risk by unregulated bulk data-sharing arrangements . #% We need to exclude imports where we have any doubt whatsoever . #% The market for more than half of our autumn beef exports has been lost and the collapse of pig prices in Ireland is partly due to the fall in demand from Russia . #% As a person who has always encouraged the promotion and safeguarding of lesser-used regional languages , I am pleased that this has been included in the report as a proposed amendment to Article 151 of the Treaty . #% Yet in spite of the smallness of the budget that we spend there are , generally , quite a number of voices talking about reducing spending . #% The European Union stood by and watched the genocide in Yugoslavia ; I hope we will not do the same in Kosovo . #% Although the directive is an improvement on the Commission 's proposal which we rejected in 1996 , it still does not go far enough to protect the environment and public health . #% Parliament has a commitment to continued investment in Objective II-type areas and has requested two additional Community initiatives for urban and industrial areas . #% The EU and European nations must be willing to give shelter and resources , too . #% On the VAT question , I agree in substance with what the rapporteur has said . #% Healthcare should never be treated as a commercial market service . #% It is important that this Parliament recognises that over the last year and a half , tremendous progress has been made in Turkey and this should not be forgotten . #% Future EPA negotiations , as well as eventual implementation , should be the subject of closer parliamentary scrutiny . #% The main problems which exist with its implementation are the slowness of the procedures , the lack of free legal aid in some of our countries , and the excessive recourse to the use of the exemption clauses . #% Whilst it is essential that we try to encourage peace and democracy in the Mediterranean , it is absolutely clear that the strategy behind the European Neighbourhood Policy has so far failed . #% It is however my view that EMSA should not be given responsibilities for combating terrorism : these must continue to be the responsibility of the Member States , and I welcome the clarifications contained in the report in this regard . #% Mr President , first of all I think it is outrageous and very irresponsible of the Commission that it should actually pursue something without first having an independent assessment of its consequences . #% Adults are twice as likely as previously thought to develop cancer after being exposed to tritium and this particular tritium was discharged by a factory . #% 
In reality , however , we also have to realise that a lot of oppressive legislation has been brought in recently just one of the things mentioned tonight is the European arrest warrant and at the very least we need something to counterbalance that to ensure the rights of suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings . #% I ask you to look at that issue , particularly as broadband means the Internet is on all the time . #% These rules will form a blueprint that can be followed in the event of any new scientific information being made available or if more radical action is required . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , Famagusta is being held hostage . #% The Commission has claimed that it is unnecessary for it to investigate the UK 's national implementation since it finds that the UK is compliant today . #% There is also a belief that the objective of a common policy on immigration should be enshrined in the proposed new treaty . #% One of the greatest challenges facing us in the European Union today is to ensure that we do not have a knee-jerk reaction to every horror or outrage . #% We need to discuss with each other - and this is not an attempt to interfere with the right of initiative of the Commission - is the law necessary ? #% I wish to quote from the letter that Gillian Shephard wrote to you in which she says : ' We do not wish to go down the path suggested by the Commission . ' #% The creation of a European company has long been seen as essential to a comprehensive body of European company law which promotes business . #% Progress on Europol will be the litmus test of proving how serious Member States are in relation to delivering on their promises . #% The Commission initially sought to introduce criminal sanctions , but faced with the Member States ' unanimous opposition to this approach , the Commission wisely decided to settle for a statement on the matter . #% We must engage with all of our citizens and seek to integrate them . #% One of the concerns for many Irish people was the issue of whether the Nice Treaty would jeopardise Ireland 's traditional neutrality . #% The Union must ensure that European companies remain competitive in the international marketplace and that our countries remain attractive destinations for mobile investment and job-creation projects by overseas companies . #% Too many sectors are excluded , which creates gaps and inefficiencies in the market , which risk pushing up the cost of doing business . #% The number of people living in poverty has increased dramatically . #% To achieve this we will require radical rethinking of how we have conducted our relations to date within the Commission and Parliament . #% If Mr Soulier 's paragraph 18 which says ` there is no alternative to nuclear power ' is passed , we will vote against his report . #% These workers were willing to work for considerably below the going rate when the airline started , recognising that the company could not afford the higher wages at the time . #% Where , then , does that leave this decision by Parliament , and would the Council suggest that all Member States would need to put such a framework in place immediately ? #% The efforts of all involved in this great institution need to be duly recognised and lauded . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Böge on his report and especially his highlighting of the importance of investment in research and development with a view to meeting the Lisbon Agenda objectives . #% As the Commissioner has said , it constitutes almost 14 kilograms per head and is growing by at least 3 % to 5 % every year . #% I have said here before that the poor are used far too often in far too many negotiations . #% If we stop that trade , animals will still move to Lebanon , perhaps from Australia and other areas . #% Surveys carried out within the EU have shown that banks are confident that all ATM machines will have all the necessary stock of the new euro currency notes . #% When we come to vote on this report tomorrow , we will support the candidature of the 11 candidate states . #% This is an EU peacekeeping mission and therefore concerns all EU Member States , whether they are participant countries or not . #% I support economic coordination , but everybody playing in the same pitch must play according to the same economic rules . #% Credit is certainly due to the Commission , which has consistently supported the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages . #% He highlights the fact that 15 % of the legislation adopted on the single market has not , as yet , been transposed in all the Member States . #% Mr President , there is great concern , and justifiably so , surrounding the extremely grave situation in the Middle East . #% In this case , the EU and Egypt have an association agreement that has been in force since June 2004 . #% We must give the inspectors more time . #% As tax havens and off-shores deprive developing countries of multiples of the amounts raised through ODA , inaction in this field is unacceptable . #% Uzbekistan is a large and very influential country in Central Asia . #% No one can convince me that we have got it right at present . #% If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future . #% In this regard I have to say that the work of the special committee and the views of Parliament were also significant . #% How do we deal with the contradiction between the different articles in the Treaty ? #% The opponents of monetary union have already come to this conclusion and are actively engaged in bringing their case to the electorate in many of our Member States . #% In this context a proposal such as the guarantee fund , which puts in place a fourth building block in the development of the infrastructure of the Community audiovisual market is to be welcomed . #% It is about ensuring that the world itself is a better place for future generations . #% We have a right , in this Parliament , to demand that there ought to be real action right across the European Union to put into place a strategy to defeat this terrible disease , should it again break forth . #% It is very important that a declaration is agreed by all European Union leaders , spelling out in unequivocal terms that Ireland 's military neutrality will be respected now and in the future . #% Finally , despite the problems therefore , I welcome the very positive approach taken by the rapporteur . #% Northern Ireland is an example , with all terrorist prisoners from both sides released while not one murder weapon has been decommissioned by either side . #% Liberalization of gas markets in Europe must not mean higher prices for the consumer , which is the fear of many consumer associations . #% Two of them clearly came through the transmission mechanism where there was no argument on competent authority . #% I think you would acknowledge , Commissioner , that the Court of Justice decision against the French Government was a landmark decision which will help you pursue the policy you agreed at the Amsterdam Summit . #% Why should we in Europe hand over this opportunity and this potential to New Zealand and Australia . #% The same goes for interpretation and translation for many defendants . #% Mr President , I welcome the efforts being made by President Santer to focus the work programme of the Commission on a small number of priority areas . #% Now you have heard the repeated calls here today that something be done about unemployment and we are used to this in these types of debates . #% The very fact that the law is still called the Package Travel Directive shows how outdated it is . #% Now that we have a High Representative who is a Vice-President of the Commission , that person must be more visible on issues of this kind . #% I have asked our Minister for Justice for an explanation , as I understand the person in question has walked free . #% Let me begin by welcoming the moves made by the Irish presidency so far towards garnering consensus for the draft Constitutional Treaty . #% My own Group , the ELDR , strongly believes in a wider and deeper political Union . #% I congratulate the rapporteur and the committee for bringing it forward . #% Their health and safety is put at risk with fake medicines , foodstuffs , toys coated in toxic lead , flammable children 's clothing and fake alcohol containing high levels of methanol which has led not only to people being hospitalised but also , in one case in Scotland , to the death of a woman . #% Fiscal discipline and retrenchment must not take the place of a job stimulus plan , yet that is happening in many countries , including my own , Ireland . #% The pressures on young women today in my country , for all its economic success , are such that they can not afford a second child . #% No part of this Community has a better health record and no part of this Community has done everything in its power to conform to what this Commission has said . #% I would ask the Commissioner to take on board the compromise suggested by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , which gets the balance right in this area , because the Commission proposal has caused major problems in many countries , particularly the UK and Ireland . #% 
Given the cross-border dimension of this issue , I would urge the Commission to carve out an effective and strong role for itself in order to protect minors and halt the trafficking of players . #% It is important that we inject a new political dynamic into the enlargement process . #% I believe that if we get it right it will be a victory for parliamentary democracy and a boost to jobs and growth for future generations of Europeans . #% If the overall social , human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be secured , then the standards laid down by the EU ' s recent directive on vehicle emissions and fuel quality must be strictly adhered to . #% The use of cadmium should therefore be banned . #% It is disappointing that these issues are not dealt with as a whole and cohesive strategy . #% At the same time existing Member States will have to prepare the way for the accession of up to 10 or even 15 new Member States from Central and Eastern Europe . #% This situation I have no doubt is reflected in other Member states and surely it is not the way to engage citizens to feel politically concerned at local , national and European level . #% I am sure all our colleagues will share our great joy and pride in this unique honour paid to John Hume and to David Trimble . #% The situation in the Irish Box will remain unchanged for 10 years , despite the fact that it is recognised that there is a crisis . #% The local bishop , who is the chairman of the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission , recently said , and it is very telling : ' what we are experiencing at the moment is a reign of tyranny and oppression that surpasses anything that we have encountered in the days of oneparty rule . ' #% This , of course , encompasses the equality of all people , irrespective of gender , race , ethnicity , national origin , age , marital or family status , sexual orientation , disability , socio-economic status or indeed political or religious affiliations . #% in writing . - I voted to reject Amendment 20 , second part ; Amendment 69 , second part , as this had been recommended by both S&D voices on the Culture Committee , on which I sit as a substitute member . #% You mean more bureaucracy and red tape ; more paperwork for the farmer and more inspections , which is what they do not want . #% I too regret , as previous speakers have , the failure of Member States to insert an energy chapter during the discussions in Amsterdam . #% I did vote in favour of the motion for a resolution , as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is raised many times . #% When someone touches that symbol , they touch us all deeply , because it is part of our common , human , democratic bond and inheritance . #% There are four particular points that I want to support : first of all , the use of funds to encourage new entrants , to assist the essential transition of farm families from one generation to the next ; secondly , the prioritisation of funding to allow for the modernisation of farms and help with meeting higher animal welfare and environmental standards ; thirdly , maximum regional flexibility on the implementation of the rural development programme must be secured and built upon ; and fourthly and finally , the proposal for village renewal and the preservation of rural heritage is vitally important in revitalising and sustaining the rural communities . #% One has only to look at the BSE inquiry in the UK and the Philips report which stated that breakdown in risk communication was a major factor in exacerbating the crisis there . #% What I said in reply to the question was that the expenditure commitment ceiling in Heading 3 , internal policies , will be raised by ECU 1 billion over the period 1997-1999 and will be mainly intended for priority transport infrastructure networks . #% Mr President , I am somewhat intrigued by the background giving rise to the oral question before the House . #% There are people out there with all kind of agendas and nobody knows exactly where the truth lies . #% That industry wants to expand this year , next year and the year after . #% This reform will have major political significance , not just for our future relations with East European countries , but also for our rural areas , for food policy and for the millions of farmers and workers involved . #% There is no bureaucratic replacement for the knowledge and experience of fishermen . #% I should like to deal with some aspects of the common agricultural policy for the moment . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner . #% On average , the Latvian fleet is some 20 years old , whereas the EU vessels which will be transferred can be as young as five years . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , for her excellent report and , more importantly , her consistent and energetic efforts to achieve a consensus on the Community patent in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market . #% That is something that we have to take up because it could result in a long-term discrediting of regional policy . #% I am in favour of cutting costs related to the European Parliament . #% As the British Government addresses the final details on this issue , it should be remembered that there is no safe level of radiation . #% They must be tackled . #% The French Government is being extremely cynical in this case by having their own lawyers advise the fishermen on a case which the French Government itself knows will fail . #% If for example a terrorist attack using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons were to be launched at sea , a coastguard could be the first line of response . #% I hope the Commissioner will do some work on this . #% Does the President-in-Office of the Council understand that the ending of duty-free contrary to the majority view of the Member States has undermined the strategy of airports , airlines and passenger shipping companies aimed at keeping fares at a low level ? #% We should not forget that the European Union and its institutions were unique in building the foundations for a unique situation and we can continue that evolution of unique institutions for the future development of Europe . #% Finally , the European Union should look again at its policy of supporting NATO and the Western European Union . #% I note in terms of the future that the legislative proposal for regional policy from 2007 explicitly embraces an urban dimension and , within the competitiveness and employment objective for which my region will qualify , there is a commitment to concentrate on areas which have the most serious problems . #% I also thank the scientific community , which was not slow in giving us advice and in pointing out that its needs were for simplicity , faster administration and financial care . #% Another petition also raised very serious issues . #% We have to think about this . #% These ships are not capable of withstanding a terrorist attack , and they are not capable withstanding a fire . #% The whole question then of human rights sanctions was also considered by the Reflection Group . #% The delegation included lawyers , politicians and trade unionists . #% Companies and institutions must be forced to adapt their services to suit the needs of the consumers and particularly those consumers to whom the Internet and the telecommunications revolution could open the most possibilities of all by bringing them into the real world and bringing them into dialogue . #% The Argentinian Navy is presently on alert to intercept a British ship carrying enough nuclear waste to give off twice the amount of radiation as the Chernobyl disaster . #% The rights of consumers must be of paramount consideration for the European Commission and the European Parliament at all times . #% Finally , I think that if we have a level playing field and if we end the subsidies particularly for nuclear energy , we will see the other forms of energy coming forward . #% Such an act would be a clear infringement of subsidiarity . #% There is growing public concern about the long-term environmental impact in general of landfill sites . #% We believe that government debt in Ireland will be reduced to around 25 % of GDP by the year 2003 . #% As usual he has crystallized this whole idea and put it very well . #% As far as the environment and jobs are concerned , renewable energy is extremely relevant - I am not so sure about crime ! #% Some of the Euratom aspects are missing , as well as research , structural funds , MEDA and large aspects of PHARE and TACIS . #% These proposals were published so late that it is not going to be possible to commit money to projects until February 2004 . #% References to the struggle against fascism fall particularly ill from the lips of a President , one of whose predecessors expressed condolences upon the death of Hitler . #% In the broader political field , the European Union and Syria have yet to agree on a new EU-Syria economic association agreement . #% I want to add my voice to those who congratulated Mr Mulder , the chairman of the committee , Mrs Schreyer and the expertise that we have all around us . #% Solidarity within the EU will be vital in securing equitably distributed supplies from outside our borders , through the completion of a competitive , integrated , internal energy market . #% If we wish to hold on to an open and tolerant Europe , we must defeat these organized criminals . #% That risk , which I hope has disappeared , can not be taken again even if it means postponing enlargement . #% I am glad to see it and to be able to take part in it . #% I attended a meeting this afternoon with some Israeli citizens talking about their aspirations for peace . #% Third is the question of our commitments to Kyoto and to a clean fuel technology , using wind , water , air and solar energy . #% 
In the canton of Geneva , for example , there is a model contract which is automatically entered into by all employers and employees : it deals , inter alia , with issues such as the minimum wage , family allowances and holidays . #% Everybody is entitled to their democratic point of view , but certainly it was intimidatory to both Members and guests , hundreds of whom were trying to get into to Parliament at the same time . #% Fifty years ago or more there was no limit and we know what the results were of allowing scientists to discover anything they wanted to . #% The enlargement negotiations are broken up into 38 different chapters . #% So therefore what people really need to see is certainty . #% My group is strongly opposed to the actions taken by the Council with a view to bringing telecommunications interception capabilities into line with the new technologies . #% The enlargement process itself is essentially a political process and we must not lose sight of that , notwithstanding the many technical dimensions that attend it . #% Giscard d'Estaing said the same thing and that if the Irish people vote ` no ' other solutions will be found . #% I am not satisfied that these loans are for safety as opposed to plant construction purposes . #% Mr President , as a politician representing a very rural constituency highly dependent on agriculture , I want to say that the outcome of the Berlin Summit of Agenda 2000 was not as disappointing to myself or my constituency as we first thought . #% I would argue that if the European Union admits third country nationals for the purpose of servicing the specific needs of individual Member States ' labour shortages then it would be repulsive to adopt a ` revolving door ' policy by taking no responsibility for the tangible economic input of workers from third countries . #% It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent . #% I was delighted that Commissioner Patten was here yesterday because his is a role that we must respect and support as well . #% However , I am disappointed that there is no further evidence of any development in regard to digital literacy . #% In the Commission 's proposal there was a technical omission under Article 2 , dealing with the transposition of the proposal . #% It is , however , essential that we have a rapid system of intervention in order to reduce impediments to free movement and , wherever necessary , to provide compensation for losses for those adversely affected by such actions . #% The strengthening of our long-standing transatlantic relationship is to our mutual benefit . #% We abstained on the two Christodoulou reports and we did so in order to signal our political differences with other colleagues on one central issue . #% This will ensure a higher quality of education and will also ensure that a stronger foundation is laid to entice new information technology industries to be set up and located within the territories of the European Union . #% I support the idea of concerted actions between the Commission , the Member States and other partners in the field of education to examine national experiences and to promote best practice regarding the use of eLearning and fighting the digital divide . #% Security cover was indeed finally provided for the second half of our mission , but it came from the provincial governors and not from the federal authorities . #% Even if the gross registered tonnage of the fleet does not increase by transferring vessels , such a substitution of younger vessels for older ones will lead , inevitably , to an increase in the effective fishing capacity of the Latvian fleet . #% This is a new world with a new economy where fair distribution of wealth and tackling climate change are new priorities . #% in writing . - Labour Euro MPs believe the focus and priority for EU spending must be the funding of economic investment and research which boosts the economy and creates jobs . #% The Commission , instead of submitting a proposal to Parliament and discussing with Parliament how to overcome this problem , referred the matter to the quango of unelected , unrepresentative officials from Member State governments , to make a decision in secret and not refer it back to Parliament . #% One option which must not be implemented is a possible renationalising of the financing of the common agricultural policy . #% Mr President , the German Government has assumed the presidency of the European Union at a challenging time . #% Human rights clauses have had some success in the past . #% EU vessels fish hake and other species in waters off Morocco , and Morocco has no legal jurisdiction in these waters . #% The Irish had always voted ` Yes ' to Europe , so this time they thought it would be the same . #% Countries that have serious internal hostilities and all the terrible reaping of that where the innocent go to the wall and countries encouraging displaced persons to return home ought to be helped . #% Furthermore , around 900 million people worldwide are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty , while up to 2 billion people lack genuine long-term food security due to varying degrees of poverty . #% Some EU Member States ' services have colluded in those renditions , either passively or actively . #% The people who really suffered in this were the farmers who were not actually involved in any way at all . #% Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today 's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past ? #% I endorse the decision to update the 1984 directive which will protect people from ionizing radiation during medical exposures . #% I know that my own country has yet to appoint a woman Commissioner , and I hope that when it appoints a new Commissioner , the government will take this into account and appoint a woman Commissioner . #% Mr President , let me say that I am shocked and horrified at the Commission reply on the issue of Iraq and the dismissive way in which they dealt with it . #% Because this is an automatic mechanism , and if we have surpluses in the Community and a policy designed to get them out of the Community to sell them to markets where prices are lower , then it is obvious from day to day and month to month as world markets change that we need an order to get these surpluses out of the Union . #% However , further measures are required , including restrictions on the length of gear and measures to prevent the stripping and dumping of nets at sea . #% We are all aware that the internal structures operating within the European Union must be modernised and by 1 May next we are hopefully going to be living in a Community of 25 Member States comprising a population of over 500 million people . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for their contributions so far . #% You mentioned in your speech that you do not see the issue as a clash of civilisations . #% The Member refers to a particular case in relation to accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and Freedoms , which the Court ruled on . #% The proposals will cost an extra six billion euros and make farmers a lot poorer . #% I think it is not a Parliament decision but a Commission decision . #% The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer : the producer has been forced to bear all the cost . #% Members of ICAT , including the EU , have agreed to prohibit the importation of big-eye and blue fin tuna from Equatorial Guinea . #% In November 2001 the UN General Assembly expressed concern at the very slow progress of talks between the State Peace and Development Council and the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi . #% I know that there are concerns in Greece in relation to the Olympics due to take place in 2004 , and that various discussions are taking place on this matter . #% We have to be vigilant . #% Would the Commission consider setting up a study ? #% It will destroy the market for producers , it will ruin consumer confidence and it is something we should seek to avoid . #% The Commissioner has the support of the European Parliament in pushing forward Altener II . #% I would urge the Belgian presidency and those that follow to maintain that pace , focus and commitment . #% I would therefore like to thank Members for all their individual contributions during the time I had the honour to be rapporteur . #% So it was clear that the 1984 legislation had to be updated , and I agree with the proposals . #% In fact , in my own country , we deal very effectively with this matter through the tax system . #% The badger-spread disease was first discovered on the day he was due to leave on a two-week holiday last June , and he has since lost 64 of his 82-strong herd . #% For me this has been something of an exercise in bringing a directive to Parliament that , by the time I go for re-election will , I hope , be effective legislation . #% Let us ensure that we have consensus in the Council before moving forward . #% Indeed , in Ireland , we continue to run a budget surplus which affords us some room for manoeuvre . #% I have to say also that given that the DCI was only approved last December and it is very much a new process for all of us , Parliament has hit the boards running . #% The extent of the pressure which can be put on politicians is known to us all and can be seen in the results of the annual Council meeting where TACs are decided . #% The actions taken must guarantee compliance with data protection laws . #% In one sense , we tend to forget what it was like at the end of the 19th century when the elderly , the sick or the unemployed had no protection whatsoever until a miserly amount of money was introduced in the late 1870s to try to give some protection to older people . #% 
The Presidency of the European Parliament has to reflect the views of all its Members and I am more than satisfied that you , Mrs Fontaine , have worked exceptionally hard during your term of office to ensure that all our views were represented on the many occasions on which you had to fulfil this responsibility . #% The question is how do we respond ? #% Finally , since Mrs McCarthy has referred to her region , I can not resist referring to my own region and the importance of the film business there at the moment . #% Parliament has a wonderful President . #% So this argument is not important all . #% Enlargement of the Union will promote and consolidate democratic structures in Eastern and Central Europe . #% This proposal has serious implications for Ireland ' s dairy sector and will result in a serious loss of trade , particularly in the area of the reprocessing of dairy products . #% Furthermore , there are even in-built safeguard clauses in this derogation which would cause the whole derogation to lapse should any new entrant to the rail markets of Ireland or Greece appear . #% We have been very lucky in a lot of ways in that , at those times of crisis , many of our leaders have been able to stay calm and wait for the intelligence information to come through before responding to the threat . #% We need , therefore , to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives , to address , not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy , the apathy which you identify . #% In Brussels , there is a Members ' bar - as is traditional in parliaments throughout the European Union . #% It is now incumbent on those who have influence in Northern Ireland and those who have influence on these members of the IRA and other political organisations to give them up to the police service and the prosecution ; to allow for justice to rule and prevail . #% However , we also need to prevent the dumping of CAP-supported goods outside the European Union , which drives down world prices at great cost to the developing world and effectively prevents the most needy farmers from accessing European markets . #% Over the next five years of the mandate of this Parliament , we should be striving to ensure that , in every aspect of our working life , we can give that respect and tolerance to differing viewpoints . #% Unless crops are grown , harvested , processed , eaten , and even the waste disposed of in laboratories , it is inevitable that there will be contamination . #% As regards principle number two , institutions , a proportional assembly and a proportional government will involve all sections of society . #% Once again suicide bombers attacked in Israel . #% Nevertheless , we do have a fall in incomes . #% I do not see it this way at all . #% Mr President , I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on attempting to find a compromise between the different points of view on this issue . #% The two human rights concerns on which I wish to focus briefly are freedom of expression and the ongoing Kurdish issue , which needs a new approach . #% President Bashar al-Assad specifically recognised that Syria would not stay in Lebanon once the Lebanese people did not want them there . #% In order to rebuild this trust , there has to be a complete crackdown on illegal fishing . #% First of all , unlike many other speakers , I am not happy with the decision taken on Monday and , Mr Solana , as a former pacifist turned militarist , I would actually feel that your role within the WEU is a further compromising of neutral states . #% An open skies agreement , reducing stacking and taxiing time through better air traffic control management and improved scheduling and coordination within a single European sky policy must all be part of a comprehensive policy mix . #% We have the opportunity to lead the world with good patent law , but are we up to the task ? #% These people are suffering doubly : they are also suffering from the consequences of climate change . #% I therefore welcome this proposal to establish a fisheries control agency . #% Moving to the future , for the future we must double our efforts to eradicate the last remnants of this disease and restore public confidence in the high quality of our food products . #% No doubt there will be an appeal , but I support that for those countries for which it is relevant . #% How are dead animals going to be removed from the vehicle ? #% Children are our future . #% All the institutions of the Union , as the budget increased , tended to participate in the creation of regulations which did not facilitate the best and the most efficient distribution of the resources which were at our disposal . #% This brings us to the point of the difficulty of these regulations . #% It is always there , but local and national bodies can stand up to criticism better perhaps than this younger institution of the European Union , which is less accepted . #% They help impoverished regions . #% In mid-February Chief Inspector Laurence Williams said that he himself would pull the plug on the THORP reprocessing plant if his safety recommendations were not acted on . #% I support it as does my group and , along with Mr Spencer , I commend it to the House . #% We are a proud people , proud of our long-term record of peacekeeping and peace-enforcing by our defence forces throughout the trouble spots of the world . #% Producers need to be responsible for their own products to ensure that future products live up to a more environmentally responsible design . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Coveney for his extremely comprehensive and well written report . #% Madam President , first of all I want to thank you for chairing this session and also to thank the Commissioner for coming along . #% The consumer has a right to know this . #% He can not talk to journalists and he is also barred from going within 100 metres of foreign embassies . #% We can not seriously undertake a programme on energy efficiency with the budget which they scornfully suggest as being appropriate . #% The directive which is before us today has two principal key objectives : first , to harmonise national legal provisions on food supplements so as to reduce and eliminate considerable problems facing the free movement of food supplements ; second , to establish an appropriate level of consumer protection in the use of food supplements in the European Union Member States . #% We , in Parliament , want to be involved in translating the Eurospeak into real action and we look forward to the final draft of the European spatial perspective which we hope will be agreed at a future Council meeting . #% Obviously forestry will become very important commercially in Ireland but there is resistance from a social standpoint to replacement of the small farms on the marginal land by tracts of woodland . #% The other questionable aspect of the report is the whole issue of wanting the Commission to promote aquaculture . #% Why not battle groups ? #% Ireland is facing the prospect of closure of its only processing plant . #% In conclusion , the provision for banking 2005 to 2007 surplus allowances into the 2008 to 2012 period effectively reduces the number of allowances available for allocation in that period and will act as a constraint on Member States in applying force majeure . #% I believe that a country seeking to join the European Union must clearly comply with all aspects of the Copenhagen criteria . #% We can not ensure the support of the electorate of Europe for the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference unless people are fully engaged in the debate that takes place there . #% We are dealing with an ideal that we would all love to see : a shorter working week , more money , less taxation , more leisure time . #% It is five minutes into its new programme . #% Mr President , it is appropriate that we have a debate here on those events ; they are very significant events concerning an issue which we have been concerned about in this Parliament for over 20 years : human rights . #% Many people feel that these two differing groups can not be reconciled . #% However , I have to register our concerns about the financing of agriculture . #% Finally my main question , Commissioner , is : who decides ? #% We all agree , for example , that energy is the largest contributor by far to the emission of greenhouse gases . #% The Austrian Presidency has proven over the last few months that when you deal with a particular issue in a certain way you can achieve success . #% I was very disappointed when President Bush earlier this year stated that he wanted to renegotiate the Kyoto Accord . #% The way in which Roisín McAliskey , an unconvicted prisoner and expectant mother , has been treated in Holloway Prison is outrageous . #% Different Group motions were debated and a compromise common text was agreed and a decision taken by plenary . #% Without the agreement of the UN Security Council , this war would be a breach of international law , would have no legitimacy and would be wholly immoral . #% 
Legislation must be based on sound reliable data and all the scaremongering about self-employed drivers working 86 hours per week and causing accidents is just that : it is scaremongering and is not based on any reliable data . #% But I wish to state that it is very unwise to selectively highlight any one issue which is already covered quite comprehensively in the agreement . #% The EU must take a stronger lead in gathering essential research on any possible harm from EMFs and to recommend guidelines for its citizens . #% Mr President , I too would like to compliment Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her report . #% We should use all our influence to ensure that a role for the United Nations is accepted in this respect because there is no other way . #% That is the civilized conduct of statesmanship , it is the civilized conduct of diplomacy and it is the civilized conduct of politics . #% Another thing that is exaggerated is the transfers of money . #% Indeed , their vigour , their enthusiasm , and most importantly , their all-round good humour in dealing with difficult issues should be recognised . #% In order to help address the Parliamentary Assembly 's concerns regarding the repercussions of the current crisis on the developing world , we need to work on additional sources of financing , especially an international financial transactions tax . #% I hope that more funds will be available for renewables in the future . #% However , at the institutional level and on the question of flexibility , we are disappointed that more progress has not been made . #% Terrorism is wrong wherever it occurs . #% I would like to urge the presidency , particularly the incoming French Minister , to make this dossier a priority to help to resolve the crisis in availability , especially for what we call minor uses and so-called minor species , which include sheep , horses , bees , fish and many other animals that are not so minor in many of our countries . #% With the pressure on the various Member States from ordinary citizens , the Commission will just have to concede that a study will have to be done in this case . #% I understand the United Kingdom is looking at it . #% Combined with unemployment and poverty , drugs are laying waste large parts of our cities and destroying the lives of our young people . #% I noted recently that a colleague in this House suggested that there should be a tax on texts and emails . #% There is no point in lamenting over the basic economic principle ; there is no point in arguing that we do not have a means of competing with the global economy . #% If it is not watertight it means that certain countries will find ways of carrying out nuclear experiments and producing absurd arguments about how they are essential for world peace , just as Mr Chirac did during the debate on the French testing in Mururoa last year . #% Why should a business have to set up four offices and pay a EUR 500 000 deposit ? #% It would leave British ports vulnerable to takeovers similar to the takeover of various electricity firms by Electricité de France . #% I would like to tell the House that on learning of his appointment he told me and some parliamentary colleagues that he had a premonition about going there , but he brushed that aside and set about fulfilling his mission there . #% I believe it is right and just that the accession countries should have a decisive say in when they feel they can reasonably implement this directive , remembering that they have to face the implementation of so many directives and regulations in the . #% As we all know , that is highly unlikely . #% I should like to refer to the question referring to ` misuse of the budget to fund abortion ' . #% In the case of the Irrawaddy dolphin , I recognise that the proposal has some merit . #% Delaying enlargement would have a very negative effect on the development of the Union . #% These are good , decent , nice ideas but they are simply not working . #% I would further like to point out that the derogation for Ireland , Northern Ireland , Greece and Luxembourg only covers those elements of the package where implementation would serve no real and practical purpose . #% Specific preventive and protective measures must therefore be taken so as to reduce workers ' exposure to PVC . #% Commissioner , I have a personal dilemma : I represent a country that is pro-enlargement but a region that is urging me to vote against Bulgarian membership . #% We must respect differences in climate and soil type . #% You , Mr Prime Minister , more than any of your predecessors at any of these international meetings , went out of your way to meet people , to conciliate , to provide people with places to stay . #% I welcome the opportunity to have this debate . #% This in an impressive list and the Commission , ECHO and the various aid organisations involved deserve credit . #% Many factors can contribute to relocation decisions . #% I am also glad that Commissioner De Gucht is going there and that he will report to the Committee on Development when he returns on Monday . #% They are going to be asked to pay for this so that the police can , without warrants and without any justification , bar this bland statement by yourself , say that this is done to fight crime . #% Legislation is in place in Ireland , as part of the health and safety legislation , to ensure that large companies put in place codes of practice to deal with bullying . #% We would say to Mr Balkenende and the new presidency that there is more to do to bring greater protection to vulnerable people , to bring about equality and respect among nations , to bring help to suffering countries like Sudan and to bring democracy and transparency to the EU project itself . #% While it is important to put things right and to give people confidence , nevertheless it does not help their confidence if we exaggerate the extent to which abuses occur and money is lost . #% Would the flexibility foreseen for small artisanal slaughterhouses be defined by marketing only regionally as a result of requiring the presence of official veterinarians during every slaughter process ? #% They are allowed in there at the moment . #% I am asking that , as an amendment , the Bureau should be presented with the report as soon as possible rather than to have it at the outset of the examination of the 1998 draft estimates . #% In order to do this , we must grasp the difficult nettle of forging a way forward in the Israel-Palestinian problem . #% Madam President , in the tension between totally free market access and the preservation of indigenous national employment , I unapologetically see the priority as protecting local jobs . #% This is an area of legislation that can change rapidly . #% So we probably only expand the market a little bit and give a bigger opportunity to the cheap labour areas . #% Short-term financial assistance simply is not enough . #% There has been a certain diversity of views , Mr Prodi , among your nominee Commissioners about their personal political accountability in the future . #% I suspect , Mr President-in-Office , that we lack courage to tackle this major problem . #% No-one has yet mentioned that people create jobs . #% Too many people see us now as working against the Commission , and I want to warn that is not a healthy trend . #% Madam President , I have a point of order on the aviation industry in Europe , and in particular the national airline in Ireland which will be bankrupt within a matter of weeks unless the Commission relaxes its guidelines on state aid for the airline industries . #% As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter . #% But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where , when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union . #% I have often said it is important that we as a European Union should not just make regulations telling people what they may or may not do , but that we should extend what appears to the European public and to the regions of the Union to be tangible benefits . #% Although she was actually speaking to Mrs Ahern , I hope that whatever happens to Kyoto , we would pursue policies on a no-regrets basis , which , apart from helping the climate , make complete business sense . #% Or maybe he thought I was too hard a nut to crack because - let me make it very clear here tonight - in the future , Commissioner , I have to say to you that you in the Commission are no longer going to tie the hands of the farmers of Europe behind their backs on meat standards which they meet every day of the week and then come here and lecture us about the WTO and everything else . #% The common fisheries policy has failed . #% The new instrument must primarily fund measures which fulfil the criteria for ODA ( Official Development Assistance ) as defined by the OECD Development Assistance Committee . #% Can I just raise one typical example of an area in which we have no comeback : that of a Member State failing to act on a European Union directive . #% Good company law and good corporate governance are essential to the job security of all employees and to the protect the future of members of company pension schemes . #% The difficulties being experienced by the existing Member States in relation to reaching agreement on a single currency are nothing compared to the broad range of issues facing future enlargement to the east of which the future of the common agricultural policy and the structural fund review are but two . #% Those EU countries who have faced the might of terrorist destruction and who have succeeded , and are succeeding , against the terrorists should be encouraged to take a lead and help others who might be faced with a similar situation . #% On welfare , therapeutic and economic grounds , it is essential that European veterinarians have access to the fullest possible range of veterinary medicines to treat all food-producing animals , while at the same time keeping consumer health protection at the top of all our agendas . #% 
It found that in the three large harbours which carry on the fishing endeavour - and I refer to Kilkeel , Ardglass and Portavogie - all the fishing is carried on within a family system . #% This framework must naturally take due account of national practices . #% The Irish rate of VRT has been sanctioned under EU law . #% As regards the role of the common foreign and security policy , it is clear that Parliament and the EU institutions are obsessed with the development of a common defence policy , yet the question of whom we are defending ourselves against has never been clearly answered . #% I appeal to the House to consider this when voting tomorrow . #% I demand an international force in Gaza . #% We in the neutral countries are being told that collective defence is not going to be part of it , but of course when we get in so far then there will be no going out . #% We should look at modifying and solidifying those tachograph requirements . #% I would support you one hundred percent . #% The fact that the Americans are indebted to us for the solidarity and the support that we provided when they needed it should mean that we are entitled to a reciprocal response from them . #% It is already there and we need to be a lot more progressive . #% But , regrettably , politics is not exact and we are here today discussing a measure which is more practical than ideal . #% It is ridiculous . #% The unique role of farmers as environmental managers must also be fully recognised , appreciated and rewarded . #% That idea has been turned on its head by the economic realities of existing Member States - also by the performances of other Member States , such as in my own country in particular - Ireland , where an aggressive reduction in taxation policy , reducing the cost of labour and the income tax levy and ensuring that business can survive in a harmonious industrial relations environment with the majority of the earnings that the workers are getting going into their pocket and not going into taxation ; while at the same time , increasing the levels of protection that are available for those who are most vulnerable within our society and increasing investments in education and health . #% The arms embargo should remain in place until we can see a justification for lifting it . #% It is of utmost importance that Europe gains economic stability . #% Over the past twelve months , in relation to the conduct of affairs with this House , Jacques Santer , unerringly if unwittingly , led his Commission to last week 's crisis-in-the-making . #% Last night in Parliament we had a discussion with Commissioner Oreja on comitology , the proposal coming from the Commission . #% Mr President , my Group voted against this agreement . #% It draws attention to the fact that overdraft rates in the euro area vary from 7 % to 13.5 % and asks that the ECB evaluate this . #% Apart from that , it is not just the people of East Timor who are persecuted but the Indonesians themselves . #% My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today . #% I am slightly disappointed in the answer to the question . #% I speak in particular of people with disabilities , those who have hearing difficulties who could have text messages brought to them , or those who are blind who should have access to voice-activated messages . #% Many of these people who are suspects do not have the right to proper interpretation or translation and , therefore , these people can not be guaranteed the right to a fair trial , or the right to be assumed innocent until proven guilty beyond any doubt . #% I can confirm in the several months that I have had the privilege of leading my own group the courtesy which you have shown to me - which I acknowledge here today - and also confirm the extraordinary openness with which you do your business . #% We can not continue to export our problems . #% We also need to look at how people are educated . #% The Irish Government is monitoring , and will continue to monitor , all aspects of Ireland 's position in relation to eligibility for structural funds especially as a consequence of an increase in Ireland 's GDP per capita as a percentage of the European Union average . #% It was not possible to schedule a debate on this report ; there are no amendments ; we are voting because we want to now open discussions with the Council and the Commission . #% Our current system is complex and reflects the fact that the issue was fudged 20 years ago with direct elections . #% The present enlargement is bringing with it loads of difficulties , generally in the economic field and particularly in the agricultural field . #% It is rather disappointing that the Member of the Commission responsible for this issue is not here and that someone else is here who is not responsible for this portfolio . #% I believe that when this study is completed , it will confirm the worst fears of many in this House that 140 000 jobs will be lost throughout the EU , that air and ferry fares will increase and that EU tourism and regional policy will be undermined . #% The influx of Bhutanese refugees into Nepal began in late 1991 and the fear of diminishing international attention , therefore , is always present . #% In fact the Commission proposals represent a reduction on existing grant rates . #% If we want the next generation to be enthusiastic European as well as national citizens we must be prepared to put our money where our mouth is and invest in high-quality education . #% By tying the two together - salary and expenses - we are avoiding the fact that the system needs to be changed . #% Madam President , I am not going to make this into a debate but since the question has been raised , I want you to confirm that it will be on the agenda and that we will have a statement from the presidency . #% The traditional social partners - the unions and the employers - are certainly central to the process , but they have been joined by others : farmers , women , people with disabilities , the unemployed and other marginalised groups . #% No part of this Community has a traceable system like the system in Northern Ireland . #% I should just like to ask the President-in-Office if there will be compensation available because of the cuts and what effect this will have on the livelihoods of fishermen ? #% It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time . #% The responsibility for securing a successful outcome to the second referendum rests with Ireland 's pro-European parties and social partners . #% All of this begs the question : what can the European Union do ? #% I think that stands as a testament to our determination to protect the health status of our cattle herds in Ireland . #% Madam President , Mr Wynn 's report is consistent with the very high standard we have come to expect from him in this House . #% In the committee we are told that it is our job to ` sell the Treaty ' , that we should restrict the debate in our home countries , that referendums should be scheduled to maximise the ` yes ' vote . #% The target in SAVE II is not ambitious ; 1.5 % increase year-on-year is not ambitious . #% Mr President , this debate on the future of European road safety takes place at a time when mobile phone usage in Ireland and across Europe is rapidly increasing . #% We must not facilitate that process . #% Our group will be supporting this report . #% If not , the blood that flows will be on their hands as surely as on the hands of those who pull the triggers or plant the bombs . #% We must also remember that she is not the only woman in these circumstances . #% People are focusing on the wrong aspect . #% Some people will say that Vietnam is being singled out on its human rights record and that the other ASEAN members are free from this kind of human rights conditionality . #% The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has recently stated that it has become more difficult to obtain information on Sellafield from the British authorities over the past couple of years . #% Some people condemn globalisation , but if there is one good thing about globalisation it means that the world becomes interdependent and we have at least some pressure we can apply . #% However , we are not discussing a normal country or a normal part of the world . #% The Foreign Ministers in Vienna last week were correct when they said it was wrong to call this document a Constitution , because it is not a true Constitution in its right form . #% Mr President , I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Lamassoure 's excellent work as rapporteur . #% It should be given much more emphasis in our strategy . #% Mr President , first of all our group did not sign this resolution for a number of very important reasons . #% There would be no custodians of the rural environment , and I would caution people to take that particular matter into consideration . #% Mr President , I am not absolutely convinced that the developed world needs free trade with the rest of the world in order to make economic progress . #% 
I trust neither national government nor Commission will be found wanting in financially contributing to the great success that venture can be . #% If we in the European Union are to be taken seriously in promoting high standards of human rights in the world , we must make sure that our own house is in order . #% We certainly know it in macro-economic terms with regard to EMU . #% The proposed European Aviation Safety Agency will need this kind of data if it is to carry out its work effectively . #% What people were asked to decide on in Nice are new ways of running the EU , which are unacceptable . #% Let them verify whether or not weapons of mass destruction were there . #% Furthermore , as the sea is the ultimate sink for much industrial material from the shores and rivers these sources must be included within the definition . #% Member States , at the next revision of the Treaties , must adopt a clear legal base on the EU Treaties to promote the best interests of the child . #% This is someone whose life is going to be terminated and his right both to produce new evidence and a fair trial has been denied . #% Mr President , the assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and the seven other Palestinians was a clear breach of international law . #% Mr President , the murder of Rosemary Nelson sent a shiver through the whole of Ireland . #% The brutality with which she has been treated in the English prisons is outrageous and I ask you to intervene with the British Government so that something can be done . #% The practice is amoral , unethical and completely unsustainable and results directly from the Common Fisheries Policy , which criminalises fishermen for landing by-catch , thereby forcing them to discard - fishermen who are desperately trying to make a living while faced with ever-depleting levels of fish stocks . #% But what do the people in the gallery , what do the men and women in the street care about in terms of their own television ? #% It would therefore be premature to draw any conclusions on the outcomes of the deliberations of the Conference . #% Do the amendments actually violate EU law ? #% It is a day when parents like to be with their children , when grown up children visit their parents ; and in closely knit communities it is the day when people can find time to visit the sick , the aged and the lonely . #% That is the kind of cooperation we Unionists have to put up with ! #% Speaking personally , I share some of the concerns which the Member raises . #% Why should they be in a career which has economic uncertainty when other occupations offer a much more attractive life , much more security , work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. , with week-ends off and with long holidays ? #% in writing . - I voted against this dangerously worded draft directive from the Commission and Council that sought to create a low pay job market for migrant workers in the EU . #% I should like to compare that with the audit report on the same TAO . #% There are other ways of trying to influence the situation and the Council is doing everything in its power to use those avenues . #% How will we be able to pursue organic food production in crops such as wheat and the cereals ? #% Now the Commission has proposed a substantial cut in compensation payments to the cereal sectors . #% But we also know only too well the enormous benefits that accrue to everyone when violence ends and real negotiation and dialogue take place . #% The European Union 's relationship with both the African Union and the Southern African Development Community has been damaged by African states ' insistence that banned Zimbabweans should be included in meetings in Europe . #% I am happy that I am able to contribute on this subject because , while I am not a member of the relevant committee , nevertheless , it is a subject that I have thought about . #% Foremost in the minds of Members who , like myself , represent coastal regions of the Union heavily dependent on fishing are the Commission 's recent proposals on the reform of the CFP . #% Secondly , throughout Europe , but especially in Ireland , there is a trend of building on flood plains . #% It provides a fundamental new way of conducting commercial transactions and has far-reaching economic and social implications . #% I do not have a piece of paper which tells me so , but there are various conventions and laws and international rights which exist and which protect me as a citizen of the world . #% So we must make the investment , not only in records and inventories , but also in gene banking and conservation of what still remains . #% I also welcome the strong support given by EU leaders to Yasser Arafat ' s role as `` Israel ' s negotiating partner both to eradicate terrorism and to work towards peace . '' #% Finally , I strongly support the call by Mr Pasty for a decent and fair amount of time to discuss these extremely important proposals that have been put forward by President Santer on behalf of the Commission . #% Some people say that there is a tension between these two ideals . #% I thank Commissioner Reding for her comprehensive reply . #% I would also like to pay tribute to Ireland 's public service which , though relatively small in number , has managed to rise to the challenge of preparing and coping with the presidency and , in many instances , chairing many of the 2 , 000 and more meetings that are part and parcel of the work of the presidency . #% But there is no guarantee as to how this legislation will be used . #% The European Union has affirmed on a number of occasions the need to ensure that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people , both collectively and individually , is always protected . #% Equally I have no difficulty in endorsing - and indeed emphasizing - the need for effective cooperation to combat drug gangs whose members , if they care in any way , have so many deaths and ruined lives on their hands . #% This Parliament from the outset has championed the cause of including fishermen and their legitimate representatives in the decision making process . #% Many of the wells had to be closed . #% It is also disturbing to read in the explanatory statement - and this has been raised by Mr Kindermann - that 100 000 tonnes of herring was caught as a by-catch with sprat in the Baltic up to 1996 . #% It makes no sense for Parliament to duplicate the work of the Council . #% The agreement at the summit on the draft revision of the Treaties was a major breakthrough and a special word of thanks is owed to those involved , in particular the government representative Noel Dorr , for the leading role he played in this respect . #% Ireland is a member of the ILO and yet the Irish constitution , as interpreted by our courts , gives employers the right to refuse to recognize unions . #% It is important to state that the establishment of a European budget for the construction of these networks must not be at the expense either of the structural funds or of the common agricultural policy . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mrs d'Ancona on her attempt to try and bring about a consensus in the House with regard to what is a very difficult subject , on which there are many divergent viewpoints and opinions in this Parliament . #% They are still in a holding centre with no assurance of being granted asylum and facing the possibility of deportation and death . #% At the very least , we should name and shame those States that are failing to invest in health services that can save lives if they are properly applied . #% Sadly , we lost one of the driving forces with the sudden death , earlier this year , of John Bonda , but others will carry on his work in the Export Council . #% On the last point that you made with regard to the rules concerning excessive public deficits and the fact that proposals have been made to Italy , Portugal , Hungary and the United Kingdom , what about France and Germany ? #% When the ten new Member States joined in 2004 , we welcomed their membership for various reasons , not least because those countries in central and eastern Europe had marked a major milestone in their remarkably short transition from the horrors they had experienced under communism to democracy . #% The walls which have been built there completely defy any kind of international logic or law . #% I would like to ask the Commission to monitor the situation closely and utilise all the tools that it has at its disposal to rectify matters . #% In fact , the price of bullocks and the number of new car sales , in no particular order , have long been yardsticks of economic performance in Ireland . #% I hope that we will learn the lessons for the next programme of structural funds and that a regulation will be drawn up that will be easier to administer and that will not try to do everything for everybody in the entire Community with a very limited amount of money . #% Firstly , the relatively small risk of a very serious accident with huge implications . #% Similarly , we can not accept the ECR toolbox-based approach without sufficient evidence and impact assessment to demonstrate that this is the best way to protect consumers and help businesses . #% I ask you for your support for my amendments in plenary . #% As you said yourself , you do not want to propose alternatives because you do not want the Irish people to ask what those alternatives are . #% Just let me remind the House that no religion - or political movement for that matter - is without its fundamentalists . #% Mr President , for those who still cling to the European dream , Mr Juncker 's presidency has been a stunning failure . #% Therefore , I regret to say that my final vote on this project will be seriously affected . #% These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe . #% 
But I am convinced that I can bring the majority of Irish people on board with me , and in every other Member State it is the same thing . #% That was not done in isolation : President Barroso already had confidence placed in him by the governments of the 25 Member States who put his name forward for that position . #% Indeed , I have proposed in Ireland that vat on labour for such work should be reduced from 13.5 % to 5 % to encourage retention of jobs and demand for these renovations . #% Could I finally say that we should ease up a little on the ageism in relation to the praesidium . #% This is a straightforward and logical way of dealing with terrorism and those who genuinely want to solve the problem should have no difficulty in following that path . #% It is essential that the weapons inspectors return to Iraq , for Hans Blix to be allowed back in . #% Now we hear new proposals coming forward that if we have a situation of enlargement , we have entirely new proposals for entirely new policies towards the new Member States and without any provision as to how these will be financed . #% When we look at the overall context of this new vista of the knowledge economy and at the opportunities it presents , there are opportunities , but the risk that we run is , because of the huge amounts of money required in investment and infrastructure , unless governments and other agencies are involved , along with private financing , then peripheral and rural areas will lose out on access to these opportunities . #% The one thing we have agreed upon is that we are not going back down the route of prophylactic vaccination . #% I would ask the Member States and those present to allow the continuation of that derogation . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his very comprehensive reply . #% We can now move to the vote . #% Madam President , in the interest of a democratic and just European Union I ask the Council to respect the Irish people ' s rejection of the Treaty of Nice by immediately halting further ratification . #% Neither the corrupt elite in Pakistan , represented by the present government , nor the main opposition party , have any answers for the people . #% My concluding comment is : get this money into the system fast ; intensify our efforts to restore consumer confidence in beef as a quality food product , which is what it is ; and assist in every way possible to develop third country markets as a profitable outlet for European beef . #% One change I ask that we make is to take out Amendment 4 , which we will vote on separately tomorrow . #% - The European Parliament will vote on 12 April , to adopt a new directive on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) . #% This has to be exercised complementing the activities carried out in the Member States - Article 164 of the EC Treaty - and always in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity - Article 5 of the EC Treaty - and respecting the national identities of its Member States - Article 6 of the EU Treaty . #% It is vitally important that , if this aid is forthcoming , it is properly coordinated and channelled to those who need it most . #% Treating agriculture and food as ordinary products on a production line threatens our very food security . #% We extended the list of diseases ; we are conscious that Article 6 allows for emergency situations , and that is to be welcomed . #% One of the most important issues -- brought up by all speakers in this House today -- has been the investment in human capital : the issue of training , education and the way in which that leads to further research , and future innovation and development . #% They represent policy areas that are at the very heart of the European Union . #% in writing . - I support this regulation which will allow faster and more efficient access to European funds in order to prevent unemployment and fight social exclusion during the crisis . #% It should also be pointed out that the Socrates programme has already been extended to cover the period 2000 to 2006 and EUR 1 850 million has been allocated for this programme . #% This is but a first step forward towards transparent relations between European institutions and lobbyists . #% The issues of debate in formulating the new structure for human rights have been many : #% Mr President of the Commission , may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure , the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today : that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political . #% The promotion of re-use is extremely important and particularly respect for the judgment of the European Court of Justice that waste incineration of municipal household waste is disposal and not recovery . #% Animal transport is central to Ireland 's agricultural economy . #% He has not hesitated to tackle the European Union institutions head on at the highest level if he felt it right to overturn the decision resulting from bad administration . #% First of all , I would like to commend all those involved to date from the Commission up through the Council and indeed , back to us , but particularly Mrs Roth-Behrendt , for the personal commitment she has given to this most important issue . #% While countering terrorism and fundamentalism is essential , we must at the same time safeguard basic human and civil freedoms . #% It is important that the WTO is restored in a reformed way . #% Clearly , this issue is a hugely unifying factor throughout all the Arab countries . #% I am strongly in favour of a greater regionalisation of the common fisheries policy through the creation of a comprehensive series of regional management units and regional advisory committees based on the use of ICES areas and sub-areas to define the boundary lines . #% When it comes to sanctions , we really need to answer the call that we should implement economic sanctions against the SPDC and that we should be ending all links between Europe and Burma based on trade , investment and , in particular , tourism . #% Nothing could be further from the truth , and I have therefore voted against this report . #% Some of those who took that leap of faith in earlier times were not rewarded for their courage and now find themselves more on the periphery than holding the middle ground . #% It is an extremely difficult balance . #% While I and my group will be voting in favour of this report , I wish to make it clear that there are some parts which we do not agree with . #% Beef prices to farmers are 40 % lower than two years ago . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Madam President , the proposed law to ban what is called the public promotion of gay relations in Lithuania is another excuse to crush the rights of gay , lesbian , transgender and bisexual people in that state . #% The problem that I -- and I am sure many others like me -- now face is this : my registration is accepted here in Ireland , but once I cross the border to the north , to the UK , different criteria are needed to be registered as blind , and I am led to believe that this is the case in every other European state . #% It is inevitable that new initiatives will be required to move the action plan forward . #% It is time that the citizens of Europe received detailed answers to the questions of the effect on safety and the environment of the falsification of data in the MOX facility at the BNFL Sellafield site - falsification that has been ongoing for some years - because of the seriousness of the questions it raises for the safety of MOX fuel in use and for the nuclear installation 's safety generally . #% I would like a further response from Council today . #% I am delighted to say that we have reached a good compromise on the timetable of this recommendation . #% Young farmers are an essential part of the farming future . #% If so , would you undertake to circulate this report to the Members of the European Parliament , in particular to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ? #% In February 2001 when this Parliament discussed cod stock recovery measures , the Nicholson report clearly stated and I quote : ' ? the Commission 's current proposal for a further closure in 2001 can only be accepted with the greatest reluctance ? #% author . - Thank you , Commissioner , for dealing with this question . #% However , it seems to me that what is intrinsic to this report is the point that social policy is intrinsic to a prosperous Europe and that it is not a question of one or the other , or of waiting for one to deliver the other : we must deliver both and we must find ways to do that through reform . #% Although Mr Juncker , yesterday , sought to make the United Kingdom a scapegoat , the reality is that it is the structures and policies of Europe which are fatally flawed . #% I made representations on behalf of several of those people , but to no avail . #% It is noncontroversial . #% I also fully support the proposal that the European Maritime Safety Agency should be involved in recognition of certificates of competency for seafarers and hope that the Agency will prioritise this particular area with a view to ensuring greater safety for workers and citizens . #% We must address that . #% On the other hand , the Irish Exchequer obtains over EUR 800 million annually from VRT , this equates to a 2 % increase in the standard rate of income tax and indicates the problems that would ensue if VRT were to be reduced or abolished . #% We can probably do something to recompense that , but you can not give back a life . #% Not all the European Union Member States have experienced terrorism since the end of the Second World War , but a significant number have . #% We have now added to that list the ongoing humanitarian plight of thousands of displaced East Timorese as a result of the well-planned and systematic policy of killings , destruction of property , and intimidation carried out by the militia and elements of the Indonesian security forces . #% I very much welcome the fact that the European Union leaders unequivocally stated their full support for the action that has been taken in the fight against terrorism in all its aspects and reaffirmed their solidarity with the American government . #% We want real solutions for real issues . #% We must learn from the difficulty and I invite the Commission at the earliest date to redouble its efforts to submit a new proposal , so that we can drive the Lisbon reform forward . #% Madam President , the principle of this legislation is supported by the Liberal Group as a proportionate , timely and appropriate response to the ill-judged extra-territorial legislation of the United States . #% 
50 million live with epilepsy , over 80 % of them in the developing world ; 24 million live with schizophrenia ; 37 million live with dementia , mainly Alzheimer 's and , with an ageing population , this is increasing all the time . #% If this is the outcome of our international trade agreements , I really think we have to start changing this situation and changing it quickly . #% The structural funds have proven to be a successful vehicle for generating economic growth in the less well-off regions of the Union . #% I am particularly pleased that I caught your eye on my last day in Parliament ! #% Ireland 's unique position is not included in the proposal for a directive on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste . #% We are asking Member States to pledge their commitment to the encouragement of renewable energy - and they all say , individually , that they have this commitment - by signing a Charter on renewable energy - the EURENEW Charter . #% We got into the mess we are in because people were on automatic . #% Mr President , I should like to express my support for the Italian Government in its efforts to conclude the EU Treaty negotiations by the Council meeting on 13 December . #% I know it is not directly an issue for the Commission , but how can we stand up here and wax eloquent about water safety and about water being essential for life -- on which we all agree -- if we continue to allow a Member State to pollute the public water supply with fluoride ? #% The resolution rightly identifies the need to develop job opportunities outside agriculture in rural areas . #% Only last night they suspended strike action which they had threatened because they have now reached an interim agreement which will ensure that they are actually paid for the overtime they work . #% Let the farmers produce the food . #% Ladies and gentlemen , I hope you will visit the exhibition outside this hemicycle on the Teres II programme . #% Perhaps it is because East Timor is very far away and a very small country , that the crucial issues at stake in this dreadful catastrophe engulfing the country at the moment have been of little concern either to ourselves within the EU or , of course , to the United States . #% What is more , not even the Brazilian people will profit from the mining resources which will be sent out of the country to the industrialized countries . #% These meetings afforded a rare opportunity to take decisive action to rectify the dangerous situation of the EU fisheries . #% in writing . - I voted against the report on the integrity of online gambling as I believe the alternative motion , which was rejected by the plenary , would have better reflected the up-to-date position in the online gambling sector . #% We now have a situation where Members are standing up in this House to say that they are defending workers ' rights in Latvia as well as in Sweden , despite the fact that the only exact information we have is that Latvian workers have lost their jobs because of the actions of some Swedish governments and trade unions . #% It is clear that an international force must be interposed between them , because there is literally no other way of keeping them apart . #% I am calling on the Commission , under the auspices of the European directive , to carry out a broader study of the possible public health consequences of PVC products consigned to landfill dumps in Europe . #% You have all our good wishes . #% However , we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission . #% I am very pleased that Mr Mombaur accepts the target of 15 % of primary energy by the year 2010 , a target set in the Madrid Conference and in the action plan following that conference recently followed up in Milan . #% Amendment No 3 , which dealt with the legal concept of habeas corpus , had been circulated to us in the Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group . #% It is a lesson to the Middle East that it is unwise to nationalise the oil industry . #% I would appeal to the Commission , to the incoming Irish presidency and to you , Mr President , particularly as the EU-US Summit will be held during the Irish presidency , to impress upon President Bush the serious misjudgment he is making in this matter and the potential negative consequences for us all in western Europe . #% This illustrates the need for better cooperation between law enforcement agencies in various Member States . #% We must at all costs avoid the creation of scientific cartels . #% They should think carefully about the effects on their own electorates who are watching with increasing disenchantment the distant and cumbersome European superstructure . #% Our ultimate aim has to be the reduction of these unwanted by-catches and the virtual elimination of discards through a discard ban , with incentives in place to ensure that all unwanted by-catch must be landed . #% It is precisely because I agree that I believe this Parliament should use this occasion to signal to the Court of Auditors its intense disquiet at the fact that a document of substance of the sort prepared by the Court should , whether correct or incorrect in terms of its content , have found its way into Der Spiegel of 8 November . #% I hope that the other groups will agree with the PPE-DE Group on that issue . #% Yet it seems to me that what is going on here is discrimination of the most blatant nature . #% In many cases , the lack of adequate economic return has been an important factor in the failure of sponsoring companies to commit the necessary resources to generating the data necessary to satisfy EU regulatory requirements for fixing MRLs . #% The sanctions constitute relentless lethal force , and innocent Iraqi people caught between opposing forces are paying the price . #% This could mean that the reprocessing shipments that have normally gone to Sellafield-THORP will be discontinued , thereby raising questions about the economic viability of that plant . #% Both these issues are interlinked to a small extent , particularly in the context of economic criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty which prospective participants in the European Union must comply with in the single currency system . #% We have avoided it for very good reasons for many years . #% Mr President , since our debate last year on enlargement , there has been very considerable and commendable progress . #% I believe it is a sensible and understandable oral amendment . #% There is an old maxim in the British system legal system called `` justice delayed is justice denied '' , and this case has been dragged out again and again . #% I would like this House to reject what I consider to be a disgraceful resolution by the GUE/NGL Group . #% I am very interested in looking into the creation of a carbon fund for Africa , as the Commissioner has suggested , and where that will take us . #% I know that many of them are keen that we complete our business here tomorrow and enable the Council to arrive at an early decision . #% It is not right that one in four people below the age of 25 have difficulty in getting a decent start in life . #% In the overall context of the peace process in Ireland , the European Union has been at the forefront in providing political and financial support -- and it is clear that it will continue to play an active and central role in this regard . #% Many other important arguments and proposals are put forward in this resolution and my group is particularly pleased that at the outset of the report Mr Schulz stresses the decisive role of the family in ensuring the balanced development of children . #% Issues of high politics are caught up in issues of human rights . #% If we can get one job in every SME in Europe , we will end the unemployment crisis . #% I felt ashamed , Madam President , in this neighbourhood that refused to be marginalized , that right now there is nothing I can do . #% It is a new means by which to organise the activities of mankind . #% I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds . #% Their application so far has gone nowhere . #% I would ask the Hong Kong authorities to take note of this debate , to take note of this resolution , especially our request for the publication of a draft bill which should be subject to further consultation . #% It is clear that there is a need to improve on aspects of monitoring the Common Fisheries Policy and proper sanctions for those in infringement . #% Secondly , what is the Council going to do in relation to a number of EU citizens who are imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay , as it is clear that the British are too scared to stand up to the Americans and defend their own citizens ? #% To take the example of the Services Directive -- you say that you are committed to the European social model . #% I will therefore vote against amendments , such as Amendment 49 tabled by Kathy Sinnott and others , which endanger embryonic stem cell research . #% The emergence of BSE in the older animal group tends to undermine consumer confidence even if they are not destined for the food chain . #% This must be our resolve . #% I do not accept that workers should be forced to work longer as a result of cuts , regardless of who their employer is . #% The common position does not guarantee this ' . #% As the Commissioner has said , they involve over 120 different countries . #% We are now witnessing another milestone in the return to peace for future generations . #% We do not have the time to go into that . #% Indeed , we are all being drawn into an internal political debate but as the rapporteur says , the consequences of the decision were indeed dreadful . #% 
The fact of the matter is that the greater the use of greenhouse gases , the greater the effect that this has on climatic change which in turn will have a devastating effect on coastal communities and island communities not only in Europe but world-wide . #% The resolution we are going to vote on this week will provide the guiding line for upcoming negotiations on the next-generation development instrument . #% But I enjoyed our very interesting discussions and I am very pleased that we achieved a result . #% Back in the 1960s in the European Court of Justice , the primacy of European law over national law was brought into being . #% They had to send for someone in the Commission . #% In particular , I refer to paragraph 20 which recommends that the total or partial substitution of ` physical ' investments by the supply of adequate telecommunications services in such a way as to minimize the cost of investment and the constraints on the environment be systematically included as part of the evaluation process of investments financed by the structural funds and be a substantial part of the national programmes as presented in the framework of these funds . #% The European Union is implementing the European Climate Change Programme , which will ensure that the Union achieves the 8 % cut in emissions between 2008 and 2012 , which is our political commitment under the Kyoto Protocol . #% It reaffirms the European Community 's commitment to reducing climate change and will provide a considerable stimulus to the development of new environmental technologies , thus contributing to our Lisbon Agenda knowledge economy goals . #% So far it has shown itself to be more interested in political posturing and media manipulation than in getting justice for the McCartney family . #% Firstly it provides increased premiums for only certain people , those involved in Morocco . #% There are real risks if we simply address this question from an economic point of view , regarding and valuing citizens simply for the contribution they can make to the economy or the workforce . #% There is no reason why every single institution should not take a hard look at itself to determine what the most important issues to be tackled are and how legislation can be improved and made more relevant to the people . #% The Roadmap also calls for the immediate dismantling of settlement outposts erected since March 2001 . #% Madam President , I should like to say that it is a decision made by the Irish people , whether we like it or not , and I do not particularly like it . #% If we do not apply household or domestic water charges by then we will have to explain our action to the Commission . #% Mindful of what the Minister has said , and also of what Mr Hyland has said , Mr Cunningham gave a commitment to have this matter looked into in some detail at the Agricultural Ministers ' Meeting . #% Even in countries such as the UK , where the EU programmes have funded some of the most important coastal zone management and regeneration projects , local authorities are unable to give priority to funding integrated coastal zone management actions because of the absence of a national policy framework , statutory duties , responsibilities or adequate funding . #% The privilege we have in Ireland should be extended to all Member States . #% This is partly due to the advent of BSE , foot-and-mouth disease in Europe and the chicken dioxin scandal that took place a couple of years ago . #% The rate of animal death in the area was so alarming that it sparked an investigation a number of years ago , which documented unprecedented animal deaths . #% This is why I abstained on the final vote . #% We are 50 % dependent on imports into the EU . #% They give greater security to domestic workers , simplify matters for employers and eliminate grey areas and ambiguities . #% Mr Watson 's reference back to 1787 tempts me to go back a little further . #% There is one point of detail I would like to finish on . #% The issue is not as black and white as it is being presented . #% Part of the problem is the burden of excessive legislation and bureaucracy . #% The most effective single action that the European Union can take to resolve this problem is to decrease the size of its fleet . #% The proposal to amend the original directive on this matter will ban the marketing of toys and childcare articles containing PVC which are designed to be placed in the mouths of children under the age of three . #% So much for democracy . #% They are uncertain as to what the current hike in oil prices will mean , how long the side-effects will last and what to expect in the long term -- their future . #% I do not believe that there is a faith amongst people in the Member States that in fact what we rhetorically commit ourselves to we are prepared financially to commit ourselves to . #% Mr Bowis mentioned the case of Dr Shipman , a doctor in my constituency who may have murdered up to 200 patients after forcing some of them to change their wills in his favour . #% But I have to say that ultimately , it will be the consumer who will pay because , if all the farmers stop producing , you are going to have to import this food from abroad , with all the problems this entails . #% I just wish to record my thanks and appreciation to the Prime Minister for his very extensive and comprehensive reply . #% In their interests and in our interests it is essential that we do this as a matter of urgency . #% It is for this reason that we must quickly put beyond doubt the safety of all food , including beef , through a credible and totally transparent traceability programme . #% There is an urgent need for a third-party monitoring system to be appointed in an effort firstly to end the violence which is taking place now on a daily basis , and secondly to resume peace talks . #% Voting against the report would merely have the effect of sending the report back to the Budgetary Control Committee without a clear expression of what happens next and by what means . #% I am saying no to unilateral war . #% These methods could be applied to other sectors or issues if necessary . #% My group will not be voting for those particular amendments . #% The provision for the current year is for a growth of around 8 % . #% I also want to refer to the question of the Statement of Assurance and discharge . #% Irish milk chocolate - I was tempted to partake in the chocolate bar that was on display - is appreciated as a product of quality and provides high consumer satisfaction . #% I hope tomorrow that we will , in a final vote , deliver a very strong message from this House into the hands of our President to respond to the challenge of Cardiff to say we have listened , we have paid attention and the ball is now firmly in the Council 's court . #% The Burmese army still continues to perpetrate gross human rights abuses against ethnic civilian groups including beatings , rape , destruction of food supplies , forced relocation , torture , forced labour , extra-judicial summary executions and disappearances . #% The idea that people as young as 14 are to be fingerprinted is completely unacceptable . #% Food is an internationally tradable product and it is therefore very important that a coordinated and common approach is taken to promoting food safety in Europe . #% We are happy that she is here this morning and has given a very full explanation of what she has undertaken . #% Our next step must be to convince young people , especially young women , not to go down this road . #% However , although I acknowledge that the report outlines the difference in treatment to be afforded to high-sea fisheries and smaller-scale fisheries , it is lamentable that any more expense be imposed upon the latter particularly . #% Its implementation was a momentous , historic development , representing the largest quantum leap towards political union . #% I appreciate and understand the constraints which the President-in-Office of the Council has with this question . #% May I ask you therefore to write on behalf of the European Parliament to all those involved and congratulate them on this major initiative ? #% We must also support the efforts of the African Union to monitor and , if necessary , enforce peace to protect civilians . #% That kind of language is inflammatory and dangerous . #% What has the Commission done in its approach to agreements , other than to change the name ? #% A recent EU Fundamental Rights Agency report concludes that ` The amendments could potentially criminalise almost any public expression or portrayal of , or information about , homosexuality ' . #% So , we might ask why the Commission is proposing to admit 75 or 100 million very poor people without any expansion of the resources of the Union . #% We should return to and revise this directive within three to four years , in the light of whatever changes may take place . #% Basically , my problem is that I had questions down - as some other people did - to Commissioner Byrne . #% However , amendments have been tabled in line with its proposals and these must also be accepted by the House , otherwise we will be in deep conflict with our citizens . #% Finally , I believe that Syria , which seeks complete restoration of the Golan Heights , has announced that it is willing to renew peace talks with Israel , but only from where they broke off in 1966 . #% They fully support the common position on this issue , and that is why we would urge all Members to think with their hearts , but most importantly with their minds , about what protection they would like to see if they have ideas . #% Is there any chance that a portion of the transfer fee for under-23s might go directly to the amateur club which nurtured their skills ? #% 
Mr President , the key objectives which the Spanish Government set out for its presidency of the European Union have been achieved . #% I welcome the decision on satellite surveillance of fishing . #% If I might just address those who are calling for Christianity in the Constitution , could I suggest that if God existed she might ask the men who run the churches and the synagogues and the mosques to respect all human rights , and in particular respect the rights of the women they exclude from their ceremonies and from their theologies ! #% I do not agree with all the details in the proposals before Parliament this morning . #% The bottom line is that if we want people in Europe in every country to initiate a new experiment in sharing their democracy , sovereignty , benefits of freedoms , then we , as their elected representatives have to lead courageously by spelling out in great detail how it will work . #% I am delighted to say that the industry concerned with renewable energy has this evening taken the very sensible step of setting up the European Renewable Energy Export Council . #% I would maintain that acceptance of the deal struck in conciliation is the best solution for Parliament but we must learn the lessons , particularly in our negotiations on the Fifth Framework Programme . #% We are politically rudderless in Europe and the real crisis in Europe is the lack of political leadership . #% All transporters , lorries and storage bins must be fully flushed before reuse with unmedicated feed . #% I think that , whilst the exercise of creating the integrated control system has been an immense project , it will prove its worth in the European Union in ensuring that the money we vote for agriculture goes to the right people and that we can account for all of it . #% In fact one of the great threats to the continuity of agriculture is the fact that our farmers are getting older and older . #% This is frankly not the best way to work , and I am sorry that the Council of Ministers is beginning to expect accelerated procedures as the norm . #% It is interesting that in Brussels airport , at the moment , they are constructing a totally new duty-free shop in the middle of the airport . #% The changing nature of the market with more power generators opting for gas rather than coal to produce electricity has increased the pressure on governments to reduce the user threshold . #% Energy performance certificates help to raise awareness of where energy and costs can be saved , and encouraging new buildings and newly refurbished buildings to have smart meters give consumers more control over their energy-related decisions . #% In the light of all these considerations , I can recommend this report to the House . #% This will perhaps require some re-allocation of resources . #% These appalling incidents highlight dramatically the contradictory attitudes to migration and refugee policies in the EU . #% Once again , the priority is to ensure that these measures and this production are market led and that the measures we put in place under rural development programmes add value to these local products . #% The other institutions should recognise and realise that Parliament is very responsible in arriving at its opinion when it is given time to be consulted . #% How can a one-size-fits-all directive , like the Nitrates Directive , work efficiently in these circumstances ? #% How best to sell the message that the European Union is a positive force for the people of Europe will be a central challenge for the participants of this Convention . #% Could the Commissioner indicate in what way we can hope to measure the success of the ILO and the European Union 's efforts in this area ? #% It appears that , so far as we understand it , about 11 of these people came from Turkey , one from Albania and one from Algeria . #% I am very disappointed that the Commission , in its anti-dumping policy , does not always comply with Community interests . #% Mr President , the news in recent weeks that initiatives to clone human beings are taking place in different parts of the world is very disturbing indeed . #% Hizbollah will claim that it is attempting to retake the Golan Heights , and Israel will claim that it is retaliating for these incursions by bombing Lebanon . #% I appeal to the House to talk to the Irish Government about its treatment of people with disabilities and their families . #% Apart from industrial competitiveness , of course , as Mr Desama says , we have serious environmental and social problems which need research to put them right . #% The comments of that BNFL director are verging on the extraordinary . #% I support this as a policy objective because one of the criticisms of European legislation in general is that it is just not implemented in time . #% In Ireland there is certainly a short-term crisis for beef and sheep producers which could not have been foreseen at the time of the 1992 reform . #% Mr President , the only issue left to address at this stage , given the broad range of contributions from all sides of this House , is why we are surprised about what has happened in Indonesia , why we are surprised at the impotent response of the European Union to the tragic genocide of the last two weeks in East Timor . #% It was a great shame to see that Ireland was one of the countries not implementing the required directives , and I would hope that our government will change that and immediately implement them . #% The common position established the right for the last owner to return a vehicle to a treatment facility free of charge . #% He mentioned the black grouse and the Iberian lynx . #% The government is right to look boldly at new ways of disposing of residential , industrial , commercial and agricultural waste . #% Areas of special consideration under Natura 2000 fall under the competences of various DGs in the Commission . #% We want to share the benefits of EU membership with our neighbours from central and eastern Europe : to do otherwise would be to reject the concept and spirit of the Rome Treaty . #% It is scandalous that these attempts by the Irish delegation to delete clauses are claimed as being in accordance with the precautionary principle . #% It is ironic that we should be talking , on the one hand , about creating employment and , on the other hand , cutting jobs ourselves by our own actions . #% I see no justification for this added requirement and therefore hope to see an exemption granted . #% One of the problems with the refusal by Member States to implement or transpose directives is the Commission 's tardiness in taking punitive action against such Member States . #% I should add , arising from matters raised in the hearings but not concluded , in respect of some of the individual nominee Commissioners that should any legal or criminal proceedings arise - which I do not anticipate would necessarily be the case but which would pose problems for the integrity of the Commission - we would expect the President of the Commission to act in such circumstances . #% Constitutional challenge is often quoted in Ireland as one of our reasons . #% What benefit accrues to Ireland for the risk of being exposed to the majority of Britain 's nuclear installations ? #% I would strongly urge the Education Ministers from within the EU to put in place a system which eliminates any element of inequality with regard to the administration of the Erasmus programme . #% We would all like to see certain outcomes from elections because of our own political beliefs , but some of us have to temper our language and our thoughts because of the positions we hold . #% The Commissioner actually answered my question in the second part of his answer . #% It is not acceptable to this House and it should not be acceptable to the European Union . #% Mr President , unfortunately , the EU learnt little from the Erika disaster , when 13 000 tonnes of oil spilled off the coast of Brittany . #% Coming from Northern Ireland , I can speak from an experience of a like terrorist organisation -- the IRA -- also securing an electoral base . #% In fact , those countries that have embraced the enlarged EU market have grown from strength to strength . #% However , small regional airports are finding it more difficult to compete with larger international airports and as a result there has been an imbalance in the regional development of tourism . #% I would certainly agree with the idea in principle , but I believe that an overarching directive would cause enormous confusion in the debate , especially in the debate in Member States . #% There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it . #% Even in this Parliament , if we are honest , we do not coordinate our efforts : the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy and the Committee on Transport and Tourism are not making a cohesive policy move which would help us to meet the obligations we entered into at Kyoto . #% It is estimated that cooperatives in the consumer and production areas alone have over 78 million members in the Union . #% Events in the real world can rarely be dealt with by means of a predetermined , prescriptive set of rules . #% Might it not be better to consult Parliament along the way , rather than come back and tell us what you have decided , Commissioner ? #% We came to know and admire him as a man dedicated to his calling , his work and to peace . #% Now is the time for people to stand up and show their true democratic principles ; to show that they believe in the rule of law ; that they believe in justice and equality and parity of esteem for all people in all families . #% I await with interest the evaluation report by the Commission as to whether the Food and Veterinary Office in Ireland has the right staff and infrastructure to enable it to carry out its duties effectively in the long term . #% I am not quite sure where we stand on that but we will be advised . #% The past 10 days have been a watershed , a defining moment for the peace process . #% I welcome Greece into the euro zone . #% 
There is a Council of Europe Convention on au pairs but very few countries have signed . #% I also wish to warmly welcome to our Parliament the Speaker of the Knesset , Mr Avraham Burg , and the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council , Mr Ahmed Qurie . #% But I am hopeful that if we can get overwhelming support for it here today the Council will , as a matter of urgency , adopt it without further delay . #% This is a very sensible option . #% It sets a very dangerous precedent . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to discuss this report on the importance of libraries for the European Union . #% It is therefore necessary for this House to recognise recreational angling in all its forms as an important stakeholder in the fishing industry , and for the reformed common fisheries policy to take its economic and social benefits into account in its White Paper . #% Mr President , this is a very important report and a significant step forward . #% This simply will not happen - certainly not in the wealthier parts of Europe . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to the Italian presidency , Mr Dini , and to the Commission President , Mr Santer , for their valuable contributions to this debate here this morning . #% Madam President , Commissioner , I welcome the fact that the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines have been engaged in building a peace process . #% This report , in advance of the legislative proposal the Commission is preparing for the autumn , addresses these issues , calling for : a review of whether and how Member States use ratings for regulatory purposes in order to reduce the general over-reliance on them of the financial regulatory system ; a detailed impact assessment and viability study on the costs , benefits and potential governance structure of a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation ; the exploration of establishing a truly independent European Credit Rating Agency ; the establishment of a European Rating Index which incorporates all ratings of registered CRAs that are available on the market . #% Mr President , I welcome this programme to shift freight transport from road to short sea journeys , inland waterways and rail , and also the aim of holding the amount of freight on roads at the present level until 2010 . #% However , we must not make the same mistakes that surrounded the introduction of decimalisation in Ireland in 1972 . #% By 2050 , this will need to be reduced to 1 or 2 tonnes of carbon . #% I am also calling for much closer cooperation between the police , the courts , the revenue authorities and financial institutions . #% I particularly draw attention to the emphasis his report places on the importance of economic growth as the best means to tackle excessive deficits . #% The north-west , the west and the Shannon regions are displaying the weakest growth . #% I do not therefore have a problem with her technical proposals nor indeed the Commission ' s proposals . #% We urgently need the framework directive , not a Green Paper . #% I have recently learnt that , in Ireland , beef from South America has been found to be labelled as Irish . #% We shall have an earlier review than was expected ; we shall have an update on new technological advances in this area of energy efficiency ; we shall have a report to Parliament . #% Strict depositary liability will ensure that investors can always claim damages and will be informed of the reasons for potential delegation of liability . #% The EU is concerned about the growing use of flags of convenience . #% I am sure the honourable Member who placed the question heard me quite clearly say how much I wanted to see the IRA cease-fire restored , how much I condemn the IRA activity , and that I did share with him and welcomed the Loyalist cease-fire . #% Perhaps it was the appalling vista of the potential effects of that explosion that caused so many governments and individuals to run for cover ; because they simply could not contemplate it . #% That is something that will live with me for a long time . #% The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons , nor have the loyalist terrorists , yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community . #% If we really wanted action on Gaza , we would use the power that this trade gives us by imposing economic sanctions . #% The temporary protection period is limited to the time during which the conditions in their country of origin do not allow a safe return of those caught up in the conflicts . #% I think that there is a political will throughout the European Union to devote whatever resources are necessary at least to alleviate the present hunger and suffering . #% On the one hand , people are saying that we are not talking about or aiming for a single diplomatic corps , but it is quite clear that the aim of this whole project is to have EU embassies abroad and to abolish national ones . #% It is quite clear this is all driven by profit . #% I do not think it is necessary to draw attention to the gender of Members who speak on issues in this Parliament . #% Export costs and excess costs to the market put these regions at a major disadvantage . #% If the European Parliament wishes to extend the internal or judicial review process , it should do so through an amendment to the Treaty in the first instance . #% Congratulations again to Mr Linkohr and to Mr Busquin . #% The fishing industry is always being told to make reductions . #% You have my full respect , President Santer , and my appreciation for what you have done for Europe during your term of office . #% Those who believe that agriculture is oversubsidised should take note of the continuing decline in the number of farm families and ask themselves why this is happening . #% I would also like to suggest that if men could become pregnant , abortion would not be a problem anywhere in the world . #% It is completely unacceptable . #% We need to distinguish between two issues here . #% Would it be possible to see , through the presidency , whether this type of coordination will take place and would it be possible for the President-in-Office to come back to Parliament and present a proposed model of the type of integration which would take place , at the same time ensuring that there is no reduction in the commitment towards rural development , but also guaranteeing that all of the funding towards employment creation - which is so important for all of us here in Europe - is not just focused on urban areas . #% I would like to use the opportunity of this debate to slightly broaden the focus , because also this week we had the important news that on 10 November next we will have the accession Conference , which is an integral part of the general Conference reported today , and marks an important psychological and political threshold . #% It does credit to the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , Mr Watson . #% Perhaps the shock of the Irish result will motivate those who a week or two ago were wondering whether this was necessary . #% Two of my constituents petitioned Parliament when their parents died in a carbon monoxide poisoning incident in a holiday apartment in Spain . #% EU leaders pointed to the need to improve our overall telecommunications services . #% Nevertheless , these amendments encourage research on other promising and non-controversial stem cell research such as adult and cord blood . #% The only way to deal with these issues is through common action at a global level . #% Today most of the instruments which affect employment prospects for their citizens are still in the hands of the Member States - rates of wages and social welfare , the length of hours worked and infrastructure within the individual states . #% This is in sharp contrast with American policy . #% On the question of cross-references between a Council political declaration and the regulations , the Liberal Group agrees that those references should be minimal . #% Recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry . #% I also welcome the Commission 's communication . #% Apparently , 26 % of rapid alerts in 2002 were caused by fish . #% The negotiations for this framework agreement have been tortuous . #% Staging posts were originally introduced as a disease-control measure when the problems concerning BSE were first discovered . #% Mr President , I am wearing several hats this morning , so I apologise for the confusion . #% I believe that we in this House should commend the ILO for its excellent work . #% This particular proposal addresses some clear weaknesses which have been highlighted in the control services . #% I emphasise child labour because I was recently involved in a report in that area and I am very conscious of that . #% The promise of full compensation for price cuts given in 1992 has not been honoured in Agenda 2000 decisions , and while farmers suffer much lower prices , the cost of the common agricultural policy continues to rise . #% In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount . #% Within the constraints of the budget and of sound macro-economic policy - I underline those as President Prodi has already done - strictly speaking our European social models offer a welfare safety net . #% 
I am a great advocate of transmutation and partitioning and welcome any support that can be given to those technologies . #% That apart , the legacy on the constitutional front which this presidency bequeaths to us is not , in my opinion , welcome or happy . #% I support the view of the Commission ' s relationship with Parliament being akin to that of a government ' s relationship with its parliament . #% It is also necessary to provide the mechanism to guarantee the safety not only of those working in the field of biotechnology but also of the general public . #% This is the first I have heard about the common position arrived at yesterday and I absolutely agree with his point that it simply is not good enough . #% So , having chopped it in two and taken the highly dubious step of dividing the regulation between two legal bases -- the main thrust being environment , with some ancillary provisions grounded on the single market legal base -- the Council handed the baton back to Parliament . #% And , Commissioner , what hope have the working people of Africa , Asia and Latin America when your Commission , only in recent weeks , cravenly bent the knee to the criminal speculation of free-booting hedge fund merchants seeking massive quick profits through outrageous speculation against the euro and Greece in particular ? #% Chairman Morillon and Vice-Chairman Miguélez Ramos both refuse the technocratic approach of rebuilding stocks at all cost , preferring instead to suggest ways to ensure that stocks remain within safe biological limits . #% Each year , more people die as a result of heroin addiction in Ireland than die in car accidents . #% It is now largely through the efforts of some highly motivated NGOs and some journalists that the full extent of the genetic time-bomb which was released in Chernobyl that day is revealed in its full horror . #% Funding is a core issue and there must be agreement on the financial perspective . #% Despite huge lobbying by the tobacco industry , including an attempt to say the process is illegal , the European Parliament will stand firm on public health . #% We also need to balance animal welfare with market access and support for agriculture , not just in Ireland , but also in the EU as a whole . #% And while the disease has appeared in only four Member States , we can not yet be sure that it will not spread further . #% The aftermath of the BSE crisis and the ban on the use of meat and bonemeal has left a serious , sharp fall of proteins in animal feed and must be filled by other means . #% Some measures , such as the thermal insulation of new buildings , are indeed already provided for under the same programme . #% I want to thank the Commission for its efforts to meet the deadline for the cohesion report , but I regret that we have not yet had the communication on urban policy which was due to come forward in 1996 , and we would like to see that at the beginning of 1997 . #% I understood , and so did my colleagues from Northern Ireland , that we would have an opportunity to thank you for your welcome to the folks from Northern Ireland and especially the members of the new assembly . #% Mr Casaca has made a very good effort to explain it to Parliament . #% We can not be driven by emotion ; otherwise our credibility as legislators will be severely undermined . #% The fund should help slow the trend of increasing unemployment in Munster and will provide a major boost for the local economy as those affected by the closure of the Dell plant return to the workforce . #% Ireland 's urban transport is in chaos . #% I believe there must be a wide-ranging international coalition supported by the United Nations resolution . #% Some EU countries are breaching the Stability and Growth Pact rules and are doing so with impunity . #% Amendments from the Legal Affairs Committee before Parliament would take that right and make it subject to unreasonable conditions and I can not support those amendments . #% Again people in Ireland should not listen to those who preach about militarism , for this is a false premise . #% The most recent statistics on energy intensity show that for 1996 we are at level zero . #% the relationship between church and state #% Mr President , the question at issue here is the political management of globalisation , so that we can encourage the orderly development of trade and avoid market disruption . #% I would like to say that our Group very much supports this report . #% But we would welcome the opportunity to question the Commission in depth and eventually we can have with due process a reflective debate on the matter . #% Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament . #% The journalist 's murder was followed yesterday by the intimidation of a Dublin Member of Parliament who had also condemned the drug barons . #% In fact , the gap in wealth is stretching every year . #% Mr President , on a point of order and to clarify what I said earlier on , during the vote on the period of reflection , in the split vote relating to paragraph 2 of Amendment 2 , you requested a roll-call vote but then changed your mind and said the first part of that split vote would be checked . #% Commissioner , will you agree that in that respect , it has been really a dismal failure and that EU trade agreements have mainly benefited EU-based transnational corporations who use their superior resources to batter small local producers in many poorer countries , causing serious dislocation , including loss of local employment and environmental destruction ? #% The cross-referencing of witness statements and Eurocontrol records has established that some EU states have serious questions to answer and have so far refused to come clean . #% The European Union has consistently supported the principles of democracy and the protection of human rights . #% There will continue to be areas of need in the UK post-2006 and we would like the Commission to assess the role that both a safety net mechanism and transitional funding could play in assisting poorer regions of the UK post-2006 . #% I have been to that hospital as well , and when I was there they had to remove a cat from one of the babies ' cots when we were doing the tour in the outer part of that hospital . #% Finally , the directive should also be extended to cover the proceeds of fraud against the EU budget . #% If epilepsy is not treated , people suffer more deeply than when there is adequate treatment . #% No more parachuting into important Commission staff positions . #% To that end every insurance undertaking operating within the European Union must now appoint a representative within each Member State to be responsible for settling claims on its behalf if an accident occurs involving an EU national . #% Here we can clearly see from empirical studies that network access is by far the best way to achieve high percentages of renewable energy rather than the other methods that have been undertaken in those countries . #% The cost to the health services within the Community of a condition which , as I mentioned in my question , will affect approximately 30 million people by the year 2010 , has to some extent to be taken into consideration . #% It is very good to see people here tonight providing sign language . #% The 25 sovereign governments in their wisdom have given their support to Mr Barroso and , if for no other reason , that is enough for me to give him my support . #% Madam President , reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process . #% Fluoride , as we use it in Ireland , is a toxic waste taken from the scrubbers of an artificial fertilizer factory , which also contain poison like mercury and cadmium . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , scientists in France recently discovered extensive organ damage in the liver and kidney in animals raised on Monsanto 863 . #% Expansion of this market across borders may develop naturally through subsidiaries or branches abroad on a more widespread basis , if the market is encouraged in other areas . #% The EU is in a very strong position to see exactly which Member States are exercising the best techniques to tackle diseases , such as acute respiratory infections , which is the main cause of death for children under the age of five . #% the reference to the use of combat units ( battle groups ) and enhanced cooperation with NATO ; #% This mistake was made in India in 1970s and 1980s , in attempting to solve water shortages . #% Our farmers , who are guardians of the rural environment , could and would seriously contribute to controlling climate change by alternative use of agricultural land for the production of alternative and renewable sources . #% It was a good and open debate , but we should have had more debates like that one . #% Somebody made the comment that the Council pays . #% We unfortunately count for virtually nothing there , because we have not put the structures in place in that part of the world to maximize our contribution to the area . #% I would like to focus on one of the points in the Lipietz report -- the possible abolition of the 1 and 2 cent coins . #% However , certain eye witnesses , NGOs and members of the international press , would claim that the death toll was far higher . #% I also thank the Commissioner for his response to the report and his commitment to renew this programme . #% This issue was discussed at length prior to the Amsterdam Summit and , in my view , the correct position was taken by the Heads of State and of Government to maintain the present practice whereby each country has the right to nominate a Commissioner . #% We have heard from our colleague , Mr Cushnahan , who went there at great personal risk to fulfil a mission , who reported honestly and in a principled fashion on the situation that he witnessed . #% On top of that , there is also a necessity for us to make sure , once the legislation is passed at a European level , that the Member States strictly enforce the legislation and open up the opportunities that are available . #% As we speak the Tánaiste Mr Spring is meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in Dublin . #% 
This directive aims to harmonise laws , regulations and administrative procedures of the Member States concerning agreements covering credit granted to consumers and surety agreements entered into by consumers . #% Not all Greens and EFA members in our group - the non-federalists - would support Mr Dupuis ' amendments , because we believe that they are moving in the same direction and we would have grave reservations about that . #% Quite frankly , I do not think they believed it up to that point . #% Although some of the ingredients might have to be imported , that can be done legitimately and they are then put to illegal use . #% There is an absolute necessity to lock the two together . #% The telecoms revolution has created a rise in consumer expectations . #% Mr President , I will start where my colleague finished . #% in writing . - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the commitment made by the G20 to work on a financial transaction tax . #% Moreover , for the large majority of scientists and also for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation , the traditional MSY model has been superseded by new cutting-edge approaches which encompass the ecosystem as a whole , rather than relying on an outdated concept of animal population dynamics . #% Mr President , in wishing the Greek Presidency well , I appeal to it to make every effort to address the grave problem of falling farm incomes . #% We must be equitable and fair as to how that is done . #% We recognize the advantages due to the cuts in transaction costs , due to the harmonization of interest rates and the growth in employment potential of EMU ; but we also have to say that we do not believe necessarily that EMU and social cohesion are mutually reinforcing . #% After attempts on their lives , the doctors escaped to Ireland last September . #% I would say to Commissioner McCreevy that facilitating the free movement of services is the missing key needed to unlock the potential of the European workforce and galvanise the European economy . #% Mr President , I understand the ideal contained in this report to complete the internal market in the railway sector , thereby allowing freight transport by rail to compete successfully with freight transportation by road . #% While the market is becoming bigger , Agenda 2000 does not give us any more of a strategy than we had in the MacSharry reform to exploit these expanding markets and maintain the long-term viability of European agriculture . #% Animals infected or at risk are now considerably reduced in numbers . #% Israel , a state that prides itself on its democratic credentials , launched with impunity a destructive war against a neighbouring , struggling secular democracy , destroying its infrastructure and killing its citizens , mostly innocent civilians . #% Mr President , there are big problems with the Members ' Statute . #% Under the original regulation , Article 31 EAEC ( which focuses on the group of persons who might be subject to radioactive contamination ) was considered the most appropriate legal basis as Article 168 TFEU ( which regulates public health ) did not exist . #% I hope the day will come when passports will not be used anywhere within the European Union . #% I also recognise that the silencing of guns , though welcome , is not peace , but merely the first tentative step on the road to peace . #% Finally , fundamental respect for human rights and freedoms must be at the core of all our work in this area . #% Mr President , following the fall of the Milosevic regime on 1 October 2000 and the ensuing democratic changes which took place in Belgrade , the European Union has radically changed its policy towards Serbia . #% Mr President , I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking Stephen Hughes for the work he has done on this report . #% In Martti Ahtisaari 's proposals we have an opportunity to take that big step , to take that jump , to find not just the peace but also the justice within it . #% We could fund certain of the poverty lines and the social exclusion lines under the Treaty , but we still need unanimity . #% The President-in-Office is aware that in Florence we had political endorsement of the Santer Confidence Pact but we did not have any financial endorsement . #% Close to 400 000 babies are born prematurely annually , yet there is no funding for research in this area . #% The question of income for older people depends on the extent to which we retain the European social model of a contribution from people who are in work to those who , at various points in their lives , either through illness or old age , will no longer be able to take part in the workforce . #% Of course we are very much in favour of openness and transparency . #% The 22 million Iraqi people have already suffered enormous pain and loss . #% Therefore , there is a degree of urgency from the perspective of the tobacco manufacturers to lure and corner the teenage market with innovative and inviting forms of advertising relating to various cigarette products . #% Taoiseach , Minister Roche , Ambassador Anderson , I join colleagues in welcoming you here this morning , particularly on behalf of my Irish colleagues in the PPE-DE Group . #% 37 Members of my Committee have signed a recommendation , on my own advice , to refer this proposal back for amendment . #% Also very startling was the amount of human death from cancer and the amount of learning disability among children . #% I would just like clarification as to when the Commissioner believes the conciliation process on the junior doctors will commence . #% Also , it is very necessary for MEPs - and not only MEPs , but the public at large - to be able to find out more about what is going on there . #% We need to encourage early intervention and ensure that , if possible , as was suggested by my colleague Mr Bowis , we look again at legislation on discrimination to see if we can include discrimination against those with mental health problems as part of that package . #% If we did not know that , why would we ban it ? #% Even in training programmes this is not taken into account . #% Across the European Union we hear of young people not wanting to farm . #% Consideration should perhaps have been given to having that meeting in this House to let all Members see what is going on . #% I would therefore like to take this opportunity , I am sure on behalf of us all , to salute his sporting memory and to express condolences to his son , his aged father , his brother and his sisters . #% That is surely solidarity between the generations . #% Today , when the British farmers have a major problem , are we going to change the rules of the game and refuse to give the British farmers the assistance to which they are entitled under the Treaties ? #% I fully support the strengthening of links between European , national and regional initiatives . #% There is an onus on the European Union , if it adheres to the EU Treaties and respects the European Convention on Human Rights , to do something . #% The fact is that Iran has changed very little in recent times . #% We can not force our wishes on other countries . #% I agree totally with Sophia in ' t Veld . #% The Member States which let France go ahead with its nuclear tests all have dirt on their hands , so we can not take the moral high ground here . #% Attitudes may change with new circumstances - in any case , they have to . #% I will conclude , Mr President : this is why it is essential that each and every one of the chemicals added to cigarettes goes through the centralised registration and authorisation procedure envisaged in REACH . #% In most respects the European Union has lived up to the ideals and aspirations of Europe 's founding fathers . #% And I fully support his call for the European Renewable Energies Export Council to be strengthened . #% The Council should adopt a framework decision which provides protection against the activities of intelligence services of other Member States or third countries . #% The Union can achieve a great deal in the creation of a single market for goods , services and capital . #% Just to confirm , President , that it is on the agenda this week and we will no doubt communicate directly with Mrs Gebhardt . #% However , Commissioner , you did not answer the basic aspects of the question . #% Because of the failure to establish agreement on the new European Constitution during the previous presidency , their first main task is to reach that agreement . #% Considering the size of the other fleets in the world , there is not a great deal of room in other areas to which these vessels can go without causing problems . #% It is a well-known fact that the provisional IRA and Sinn Féin are inextricably linked . #% That is what has driven innovation to date and has propelled forward the information society and the state of the art . #% We have a responsibility to do our best to ensure , first of all , that all criteria are met , but also to do what is in our power to ensure that the Globalisation Fund ensures added value . #% The decision as to whether to contribute monies to the funds we need to implement these important measures rests with them . #% 
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch . #% The European Union has certainly adopted a series of measures to combat international terrorism in recent months as an immediate response to the horrific terrorist attacks in the United States last September . #% The biggest problem still existing , as identified in our discharge motion for resolution , is the fact that , in the administration of the budget for the year 2000 , there was under-utilisation of resources in the order of 14 % . #% Mr Parish has made the point that consumers place great faith in the word ` organic ' and in organic produce , and we need to ensure that those who want to buy organic are actually getting what they believe is a very pure product . #% Mr President , I want to speak on two matters . #% As Mr Cunha has just said , the volume of trade alone would make us significant . #% His statement gives credence to our fears about the creation of a European arms industry . #% It is clear that a successful foreign policy can not stand on one pillar alone . #% I welcome the commitment of EU leaders to continue with a multilateral approach to trading issues . #% As far as Mr Blair is concerned I believe he is the first British Prime Minister ever to make Ireland a priority . #% The battle against terrorism is above all a battle of values and a battle of ideas . #% Parliament 's compromise shows the way forward and contains a substantial shift of money towards rural development . #% in writing . - I welcome this report which is the first step in examining the shape and nature of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) post 2013 . #% The majority of these tragedies occurred on secondary roads and were the result of driving under the influence of alcohol , speed and , in my opinion , the fact that they were driving on the left-hand side of the road in Ireland -- a practice to which they are not accustomed . #% I come from Northern Ireland , and Mrs Doyle has referred to the fact that she comes from the Republic of Ireland . #% The whole point of national allocation plans is to ensure that the EU emissions trading schemes deliver the best possible benefits for the climate . #% This is at complete odds with what the Commission is trying to achieve . #% Neither does it argue for the patenting of software , nor for extending the patentability and scope of protection in this area . #% Mr President , we need cleaner energy and more efficient technologies and , in order to achieve that , we need incentives -- negative incentives , if you like -- such as a carbon tax . #% I hope we can continue down that path despite the one or two problems that are there . #% For them today comes too late , but for the rest of us it is hopefully a beginning . #% Nevertheless we welcome the improvements that have been made to this agreement in order to conserve fish in the area and move from a 2-mile limit , which we never should have allowed , to a 12-mile limit . #% According to the UNHCR my own country , Ireland , came third in Europe after Slovenia and Belgium in the number of asylum seekers it received last year , compared to the size of the total population . #% It is important that we continue to support these groups and their work . #% One of the relevant issues raised by the Committee on Employment is that the measures proposed by Member States complement other actions cofinanced by the Structural Funds , and really we need more than a simple confirmation that this is the case . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner and colleagues for their contributions , as well as the shadow rapporteurs , the secretariat of the Fisheries Committee , the Council , the Commission , my group 's policy adviser , and indeed my own adviser . #% We have shared our Taoiseach with the world . #% Mr President , I just wish to say that I agree with the rapporteur on the necessity of one vote on Amendments Nos 5 , 6 and 14 . #% This is something that we are going to see happening again if we do not look at our whole policy - this fortress Europe mentality - the fact that we are building the barricades and the walls higher and higher . #% The precedents will show the honourable Member , as they showed me , that it is not our custom to promote our friends in politics by having resolutions after such meetings . #% Obviously , whilst nine years is not the perfect solution which Parliament originally sought , it is the best possible compromise . #% A programme on BBC World Television last Monday night emphasized the point again that 82 % of all crime in Britain is drugs-related . #% In actual fact , what we are doing is to encourage them to go even faster , and we have no young farmers coming into the industry . #% Fair play is all we ask . #% This directive focuses only on Member States which are active participants in the production of nuclear energy and on those that accept the waste . #% According to the legislation , working time includes when a self-employed person is at their work station . #% History has consistently shown that the correct approach is to stand up to a bully . #% It is fortunate that the watchdogs of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament will be there to protect fish stocks and also , but equally as importantly , to protect the interests of fishermen from areas , where , as I said at the outset , there is no alternative source of employment . #% The mission must , at all times , act independently and be seen to do so . #% But the bottom line is that the US and British forces are simply unable to cope with what is a rapidly deteriorating security situation . #% The second point is in relation to Fléchard . #% However , the call to the Commission to boost its input to the library sector by establishing a focal point to coordinate library affairs and to oversee developments will be universally welcomed . #% Why do we not use our own initiative and not have the European Union hurting its own citizens while the rest of the world merely goes on its way destroying the environment ? #% Let us not underestimate the magnitude of this decision . #% As welcome and as necessary as the work of the EU Ombudsman is , that office is not a panacea for the European Union 's democratic deficit . #% Mr President , the world was shocked by the massive undersea earthquake , which took place on 26 December 2004 . #% On a continental level , the enlargement of the European Union will contribute to further stability . #% I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Miguélez Ramos , for her work in producing this most important report after very extensive consultation . #% They fail to take specific geographical and demographic problems into account . #% Madam President , the Belgian Presidency assumed the Presidency of the European Union at an extremely crucial time . #% Precarious work forms prey on the weakest sections of our societies , denying people dignity in work and the chance to build a decent life for themselves and their families . #% In the circumstances of the peace process there is no justification for this , or in any other circumstances for that matter . #% Unless conservation is the number one priority , compromises with other objectives of the common fisheries policy , such as economic ones , will always lead to further erosion of stocks . #% Anybody you speak to from the Palestinian area will tell you that it has always been the women and the children who have suffered most , but they have also been the most resilient in trying to find a way forward to challenge the failure to negotiate , the failure to respect and the failure to find a solution ; indeed , the failure of both Israel and Palestine to live up to their commitments , to agreements that they voluntarily signed up to , the failure of the United States of America and the European Union to live up to their commitments with regard to clear and open negotiations , the failure of other states bordering Israel and Palestine to take a more proactive and positive role with regard to , ultimately , achieving a two-state solution , which must be based on viability and equality . #% As someone said a few years ago in my own country : when there are as many incompetent women in roles of power as there are men , then we will have true equality . #% It is a serious social and economic problem which everyone , including this Parliament and national governments , now recognises - late in the day , perhaps - and that we are now endeavouring to correct through rural development policy . #% At a time when we are going towards rail , here are people in my region trying to close down railways ! #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Brinkhorst , Mr Fabra Vallés and Mr Tillich on behalf of my group , and say that I support their reports . #% Madam President , I want to thank the rapporteur , the Commissioner and other colleagues who are here tonight . #% Recycling can not solve the problem as potential recycling rates under ecological criteria are projected to reach only 5 % by 2020 . #% This proposal is more likely to create psychological problems throughout the European Union in rural areas than real problems . #% We need more accountability , we need more transparency , we need more devolution but we above all need more commitment . #% The foolishness of this proposal suggests that the people of Europe are more in need of protection from Brussels than from the sun ! #% President-in-Office , you mentioned in your first answer the need to stay within the parameters of the Berlin Agreement of 1999 . #% Many farmers may not survive to benefit from the long-term measures of the proposed reform which is the subject of Agenda 2000 and this debate . #% The inclusion of the five-step waste hierarchy plan and the insistence on obliging Member States to provide waste prevention plans are also welcome . #% 
The Council has today released its conclusions on Sudan and the UN Human Rights Council is trying to get an assessment mission into Darfur as we speak , so the international focus is on Darfur right now . #% We have far too great a common bond . #% If developing countries can be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people on their own licensing terms , then the costs of these medicines would be substantially reduced . #% By not ratifying Aarhus , the Irish Government thinks it can continue its practice of riding roughshod over its people , whilst kowtowing to any and every wealthy investor , regardless of the damage it will do to people 's lives , health and environment . #% The latest media reports that airlines are reducing fuel costs by recycling unfiltered air into passenger cabins are equally alarming for all of us who travel frequently and , more particularly , for the cabin staff and pilots . #% I have one child , as do many people in this Chamber . #% We should be prepared to take time to make that assessment . #% I am afraid I do not have the information to hand . #% They have no vested interest in energy efficiency and that is clear from their stance . #% Here I congratulate the Commission for taking the European Council at its word and bringing forward with extraordinary speed a comprehensive measure to freeze the assets of terrorist organisations . #% Through greater coherence in terms of bench-marking , sharing best practice and improving strategic cooperation and coordination , the EU can be an important factor in releasing a new economic dynamic . #% . Madam President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for his work . #% While there are some good possibilities in there , most of it basically requires an effort of political will on the part of Member States . #% If we want to be realistic about being the most dynamic then we must take tough decisions to reflect that position . #% But today is an opportunity for this House to review the investiture process and to place on record some of the questions or observations that arise from that . #% Finally , with regard to preventing countries in South America in particular finding it an economic necessity to grow the raw product of drugs , are any new proposals coming from the Council with regard to assisting those governments in South America ? #% This week ' s discussions at the General Affairs Council are to be warmly welcomed . #% Last summer , in the United Kingdom at least , we saw the corrosive effect of cheap South American beef imports on our indigenous beef industry with plummeting prices threatening the survival of many producers . #% There , fundamental mistakes were made in the hope of encouraging them away from the paths of terror . #% There are a limited number of services -- especially health services -- that should have sector-specific measures . #% Madam President , I want to refer to your expression of sympathy with the people of France who are affected by severe flooding . #% I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue . #% Maybe the Commission should look at the levels of grant aid . #% These rules had been proposed in large measure by the then Irish Minister of Agriculture , Mr Yates , and have been fully implemented in Ireland . #% The last thing I want to say is that what has happened in Haiti is grounded in poverty , and , when this terrible tragedy eases and it goes off the screens , let us not forget Haiti . #% I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term , if not for the long term . #% Surely we could find better uses for the EUR 230 million or even EUR 290 million , as some want , than promoting this contrived notion of European citizenship . #% The TSE proposal being put forward includes , among other things , a requirement for educational programmes for farmers , vets and officials ; the removal of a list of specified risk material , an active surveillance programme using rapid post-mortem tests ; and the strengthening of the ban on the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminant animals . #% I hope that when you are considering it , the provision of a chair for diabetes nurses in one of the Community universities will be one of the priorities for support . #% Mr President , I express my disappointment at my Green colleagues and my own group , because I was left with no opportunity to vote on two key amendments on the common , foreign and security policy . #% I can well understand why consumer confidence should be shaken at this moment . #% What businessman in his right mind would keep two factories ? #% The original Commission proposal has also turned out to be technically impossible and the financial resources destined for its development have been partly wasted . #% As a result of petitions submitted by EU citizens , Member States can be found guilty of infringing Community law . #% I am pleased to say many of them were taken on board by the Commission . #% In the context of the mid-term review proposals due to be adopted this week and the forthcoming world trade talks , I appeal to the Greek Presidency to work towards continued commitment at EU level for the European agricultural model and to guarantee a decent livelihood for our farmers . #% I am not keen on seeing Galileo turned to military applications . #% It is vital that any action taken in response to these atrocities does not trigger more attacks like it or even worse . #% I have made the point on the number of occasions in this House that one of the greatest difficulties experienced by farmers is uncertainty - not being able to plan , even in the short term , for the development of their farms . #% We all know that the market on its own will not deliver social justice for the people of Europe . #% Therefore , it is all right to supply heroin to children or to adults , as long as you do not want to make a profit from it . #% There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure . #% We voted with cross-party support to ban funding of research resulting in the destruction of human embryos , any kind of cloning , the use of surplus embryos and germline intervention . #% When we look at the overall strategy a number of things jump out - colleagues on the other side of the House may disagree with this interpretation , but this is my opinion . #% The directive reinforces judicial discretion and ensures that remedies are fair , equitable , proportionate and justified . #% Finally , a very brief point on mutual recognition . #% As a nuclear-free country , Ireland is affected by the waste coming from continental Europe to be reprocessed at Britain 's Sellafield plant . #% These are going to be difficult discussions and internal institutional reform is needed in the EU if the enlargement process is to be successful . #% Hence , the point I am making - and the Commission also shares this view - is that we need a pan-European system whereby a product authorised properly in one Member State can be used throughout the EU . #% Predatory behaviour of seals around the Irish and Scottish coasts amounts to the total allowable catch plus one quarter . #% . -- Mr President , there is no doubt that the common fisheries policy and the traditional quota system have resulted in depleted fish stocks . #% In Northern Ireland there are no such structures in place . #% Women will be in one , men in another . #% I support the continuation of the MEDIA programme for the period 2007-2013 . #% There is no intention to build a lot more nuclear power stations . #% Finally , why is it that the Council as an appropriate body can not work together in exchanging best practices ? - because there are many Member States where there are fantastic second-chance educational facilities that do not seem to be available in other areas . #% It is a language of the Court of Justice and of the European Schools . #% This line has been allowed to run down into poor condition ; its safety is questionable and the rolling stock is a disgrace . #% From an Irish perspective , we make the working assumption that the elimination of hazardous substances includes the prohibition on discharging radioactive substances as well . #% Mr President , at the threshold of the Twenty-first Century women 's bodies are used , often gratuitously , to sell goods in order to make money for other people . #% That for me is a measure of the enormous personal integrity and strength which you have brought to your task . #% in writing . - I would ask fellow MEPs to imagine for a moment that they are in business . #% The ins and outs of food supply and the food supply chain in general is a topic which is relevant to both farmers and consumers alike . #% I will continue to support workers and trade unionists in their struggle against the increase in the retirement age . #% However , it is imperative that the additional data and developments which have come too late be incorporated in this regulation and ensure that it is part of the regulation coming into force on 1 January . #% We need to see more evidence of other policies contributing to , or addressing , the cohesion imperative . #% 
It is completely unacceptable that a person , even if denied asylum , should be treated worse than an animal would be treated . #% This obviously requires negotiation and agreement between various architects ' representative bodies in Ireland on a registration process . #% Our choice was therefore limited , however regrettable . #% Mr Garot presents these facts very clearly . #% Allowing the Azores to export relatively small quantities of sugar to the EU has to be a good decision for the economic future of that particular region . #% Yet , what do we discover ? #% It is particularly relevant for Parliament to give its opinion on the future development of these policy areas given that under the British presidency the informal meeting of Ministers in Glasgow chose to devote one whole day to discuss both urban policy and the European spatial planning perspective . #% Ease of access means that dissemination should be fairly easy , but Parliament considers dissemination to be an important stage in this process . #% If this goal is accomplished , economic growth can re-commence and the recovery process can begin . #% I am pleased that the presidency has been a success and that these issues have been put on the agenda . #% As my Party Leader in Dáil Éireann , Enda Kenny , said , Robert McCartney 's vicious beating and stabbing to death was ordered by a commander in the Belfast brigade of the provisional IRA , following a minor dispute between the commander 's uncle and the group with which Mr McCartney was socialising . #% However , we are surprised that Members of this House voted for the original proposal in paragraph 7 to cut off funds to some of our poorest regions in the EU . #% Despite some joint scientific work with Palestinians , I have had complaints regarding barriers to some of that work . #% The Chief Executive of Horse Racing Ireland , when asked his opinion of child gambling in Ireland , said that it was no problem and that he wanted to develop the customer of the future . #% The European Union and its Member States have a number of very major political , social and economic problems to confront over the next few years . #% To my colleague and friend the chairman of the Committee , I should warn him that if he goes out to dine with Scotsmen he should not take their yarns about drinking whisky rather than wine too seriously . #% However , I must point out that there are some elements of this report which I do not support . #% Ensuring that the rural communities have access to basic services , such as childcare and education , is also very important . #% They have also found a transport vessel , flagged in Panama and owned in Japan , both contracting parties to ICAT by the way , which was receiving fish from non-contracting vessels from Belize . #% Of course , the great majority of people on the island of Ireland are genuinely in search of this just and lasting peace , but , regrettably , a small minority will do their best to try and derail the process . #% It is however regrettable that some unnecessary , unhelpful amendments have crept in at the last stage in committee . #% This is an important contribution to transparency and accountability . #% It is more exacting than the agreement that has existed between the two institutions over the past five years . #% We must be more flexibility-friendly , not setting down rigid regulations and rules which drive economic investment out of the European Union , sending it to low-cost labour areas . #% That is why it is so important that we all guarantee that we reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe , the United States of America and elsewhere so as to achieve our objective in this regard . #% This EU legislation aims to move us closer to becoming a recycling society . #% Secondly , we must question whether the meat being imported into the European Union is being fraudulently misrepresented on importation . #% This is the situation in many countries as a result of the legislation has been brought in under the guise of combating terrorism . #% The only information we have about the rate of fraud and error comes from the Commission 's statement for the year 2000 . #% His job has , in many ways , brought the citizens of Europe closer to us , an aspiration we continually speak about here in Parliament . #% That is what is behind Amendment 21 and why I emphasise to the Commission that the tragedy of injury is so much more than the economic burden . #% As a person with a disability , I have experienced both the best and the worst of treatment as a passenger , and should like to emphasise that , in most cases , the service providers try to achieve the maximum efficient service . #% The Irish presidency also pledges that it will be highlighting conventional arms issues . #% In the sixteenth century the British went to war with the Hanseatic League over Icelandic cod and they only withdrew from that war after some casualties because they discovered a new source of cod off the coast of America . #% I had no contact with her but I separately put down a motion for my own group and I speak on their behalf on this subject . #% While in many ways we welcome the progress that the introduction of this particular vessel brings and we welcome modern technology , in a situation where fishermen can not find sufficient stocks in order to justify the capacity that was already there , it seems strange to introduce a new vessel which may be licensed and accepted and which could catch half or perhaps two-thirds of the entire Irish quota . #% Thirdly , as the budgetary authority we should be more focused in how we allocate funding in the social fund and the Structural Funds to reward those that are achieving the most with regard to meeting the guidelines as laid down by this House . #% It is next to lamentable . #% They want aid and are very grateful for it . #% They do not own up to the fact that it is mainly unanimous agreements in the Council of Ministers that lead to the making of the regulations that the Commission tries to supervise and enforce . #% The Commission suggested that seven new substances should be added to the list for eventual exclusion . #% It is equally important that the Commission , as the institution charged with implementing European policies , should have a reputation for efficient , fair-minded and even-handed administration of European policies agreed on in Parliament and the Council . #% But first , before that can happen , we must ensure that the intellectual property rights and patenting rights are protected to allow for innovation to take place , to allow for investments to be made . #% ` We pay , they spend ' simply will not do . #% Finally , I was rather appalled last week at the personalized attack made on our friends Mr Tomlinson , Mr Wynn , the Court of Auditors , its President and Mr Balfe , who all represent the structures of this Parliament , by an independent television programme and at the fact that the President of this Parliament did not make a statement on it . #% Adequate provision of oil and gas is necessary if the European Union economy is to operate effectively . #% For our industry or agriculture to survive they have to be cost-effective . #% However , we need to have rules , and that is why in this report we have set out strategic guidelines to allow Member States to plan their programmes from 2007 onwards . #% KIMO International has since expanded this project to harbours in the UK , Sweden and Denmark , with EU financial assistance . #% There are one or two points of concern . #% As a representative of Irish fishermen I have no difficulty with it at all . #% Recently a Socialist colleague of my own was banned from China . #% In all cases , it is essential that we act on the principle of favouring the citizen . #% Secondly , as has already been mentioned by my colleague with regard to peripherality - and the President-in-Office also mentioned this - the fact is that people leaving the Community would still be entitled to buy duty-free . #% The intention was that we would use those powers , and I urge you to think very carefully before you reject this constructive measure . #% But I wish to point out that there already has been discussion of the increased importance of regionalism within the World Trade Organization . #% It is therefore necessary to maintain the embargo and indeed to tie it in with making our own Code of Conduct on Arms Exports legally binding . #% This would symbolise the added value of working together in the EU on society ' s wishes and needs . #% Pandering to the same prejudices again could well result in a second failure and consequently leave Ireland in a semi-detached relationship with our EU partners , and that would be disastrous . #% Mr President , as regards the Miguélez Ramos report the Verts/ALE Group considers that the conservation of fish stocks and the protection of the marine environment are of fundamental importance to the common fisheries policy . #% Those reports spread over from Scotland to Ireland and the papers were full of massive reductions in the number of people employed . #% Would that they could , but let us be honest with them . #% We should be limiting export on the hoof . #% The main reason why it is not being implemented is because Member States and national governments are not prepared on many occasions to find the matching funding required to bring about what is necessary to restructure an industry which we all know and agree must be restructured . #% As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development I fully support the scheme , both now and in the future . #% Perhaps they were not at the same level of threat as the UK on that occasion . #% 
I would like to focus on the Hernández Mollar report . #% Furthermore , while it is important that the observation team should consult local EU diplomatic missions , it must be independent of them and EU missions must not interfere with fellow nationals or the mission as a whole . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I too want to be associated with the words of thanks to you for your term of office . #% We expressed the same sympathy with the Greeks and requested the same assistance , but there is no money available . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this important report . #% However , it is entitled to take that stance ; it is entitled to put forward its own viewpoint and its own ideas ; it is entitled to make new agreements with third countries , if it so wishes . #% We look forward to more directives as promised by the Commissioner in this important area of energy efficiency , of energy intelligence . #% It makes you stop and wonder . #% In that regard , has the Council yet discussed and acted upon the disgraceful fact that three convicted international terrorists , who are fugitives from justice in Colombia , are now enjoying sanctuary in a European Union Member State , namely the Republic of Ireland ? #% Economic and social dimensions are intertwined in reaching the 2010 objectives . #% How are we meant to function in this way ? #% No doubt we will revisit the subject after consultation with our national parliaments and citizens ' groups . #% Its denial in China is not something we can ignore to facilitate trade with a state that persecutes Christian people , whatever the mutual economic benefits might be . #% I do not have another question , I simply wanted to remind the Commissioner that there was a second part to my original question , i.e. whether the matter would be brought up in the Security Council . #% Secondly , I hope there will be a minimum period between the Convention and the IGC . #% In conclusion , our overriding aim in all of this must be to decide on the policy that best protects our consumers . #% We must listen to the 100,000 people who took to the streets in Ireland last week to express their anger at the ` Race to the Bottom ' threatened by the actions of the Irish Ferries company and the Bolkenstein Directive . #% Far too often all the good intentions of every individual Member of this Parliament and the various committees , every good idea and every popular sentiment are catered for when drawing up the regulations , with the result that it is very hard for national governments to recognize what the thrust of our intentions is or how exactly they should administer the money . #% In conclusion , while road safety is a major issue and death and injury on our roads are at frightening levels - 40 000 per annum in the EU - like many colleagues I balk at yet another European agency and feel that national authorities should be able to plan strategies suitable to their particular set of circumstances . #% One of the sectors of the European Union with a high percentage of CO2 emissions is the construction sector , and technological decisions in the construction sector have a long-term effect on the emission rates of all our Member States . #% ' I was involved in a traffic accident in May 1988 . #% The cigarette industry claimed that their cigarette products are for adults , yet every piece of practical evidence suggests that clever marketing and advertising only results in recruiting the next generation of smokers , who are teenagers . #% It is amazing that in this day and age people with such huge responsibilities are working under such difficult circumstances . #% I would call on this Parliament and on your good offices , Mr President , to forward that immediately as a matter of urgency . #% We in Ireland must achieve these targets in terms of managing our packaging waste and waste in general . #% We do not need to defer it any longer . #% Regrettably Parliament can not insist in law on fiscal neutrality , but it does so as a matter of political conviction . #% In particular , I should like to congratulate Mrs Waddington on some of the innovative measures which she brings forward , but also on not being afraid to criticize where the Commission has fallen down on its duty and responsibility to respond to the urgent need for training in our society . #% The idea of Amendment No 36 was that the registry should adopt terms and conditions to incorporate an accredited code of conduct for online trading and therefore give businesses the opportunity to join an accredited online extra-judicial dispute resolution scheme . #% The only way we are going to get governments to respect EU law is to impose fines if they do not do so . #% in writing . - I fully support the concept of the Internal Market Scoreboard as a tool for measuring the success of the single market . #% This will mean that electric and electronic waste will have to be collected and recycled instead of dumped - as in my own country - with negative effects on the environment . #% So we have to find an acceptable position . #% I am disappointed with the I-EDN Group which chose to table amendments and ask for split votes , thus taking up valuable time in this House . #% This crisis of world capitalism is enormously exacerbated by the activities of the financial speculators on the world markets . #% Hence my question to the President-in-Office about the Council ' s position : what actions can be taken to ensure the continuance of this very strong sector ? #% Roaming prices for a four-minute call still vary from as little as 20 cents for a Finnish consumer calling from Sweden to EUR 13.05 for a Maltese consumer in Latvia . #% For the record , next week the first Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention on POPs or Persistent Organic Pollutants , takes place in Punta del Este in Uruguay . #% On the existing EU Treaties - including the recently ratified Treaty of Nice - or on an array of new proposals from the EU Convention ? #% The natural effect regions will see some hope in the reply you have just given . #% Mr President , thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on this truly historic day for Ireland . #% The goodwill is there to reach an agreement at the forthcoming European Council . #% Furthermore , future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States , for example the food safety authority in Ireland . #% We are not in danger of creating a precedent : this case is unique . #% Mr President , ours is a Union that has shown itself capable of extraordinary achievement when it combines vision with political will . #% It seems to me that this is a matter of concern not just to people in Ireland but to people everywhere in Europe . #% In most of these situations it must be said that timely action by the international community based upon assessments and early warnings of situations could undoubtedly have saved many lives and greatly reduced human suffering and misery . #% Finally , regarding company law on mergers and takeovers , the presidency has done a wonderful job in fashioning a difficult compromise . #% As you have mentioned yourself , this issue has been discussed a number of times within the Council . #% I give my support to the report in general and I am delighted with the comments it makes . #% It should also work to the advantage of any Member State to which a person moves , as it will ensure that an accurate assessment may be made of that individual 's qualifications . #% The summit at the end of this month will give us the opportunity - which we should grasp - to begin building that new future . #% We all know that the last two to three months have been an enduring exercise for political leaders within the EU . #% However , I do not believe for one minute that it justifies in any circumstances what has happened in Pakistan in recent weeks . #% We are proposing the setting up of a policy advisory committee , as is the practice in country domain names , to assist in dealing with what can be registered at top level . #% If we became a perfect pupil now in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , we would still suffer from past pollution , but the longer we wait to tackle greenhouse gas emissions in a serious manner , the more entrenched the commitment is . #% There could well be a strong role for the SOLVIT network in assisting with the implementation of the Services Directive . #% Four or five very hard criminals may be given soft sentences to convict one . #% There is a depth of knowledge within the European Union , amongst people between the ages of 45 and 60 , that is going untapped , a resource that is being lost because of ignorance , because of a lack of innovative thinking or simply because of a lack of a properly-structured training programme to allow them to adapt to the new market forces and employment opportunities available . #% It is very important that this authority is up and running as soon as possible , no matter where it is located . #% Children are naturally concerned about their environment . #% Austria , for example , was sanctioned by the European Union although it did not actually breach human rights : in fact a political party was elected with which most of us could not agree . #% It highlights the importance of EU cohesion policy as a means of alleviating disparities in regions that are lagging behind . #% Mr President , would you please indicate to the House on what basis and why you wrote this letter cancelling the visit by Hedy d'Ancona and other Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs ? #% So much for Sinn Féin 's pretence to be a normal political party . #% Ireland could not countenance any suggestion of harmonising corporate tax rates , especially in this period of economic slow-down . #% 
It is right to encourage and prepare for those conditions . #% I thank Mr Rothley for his research in this area and for clearly identifying the areas in which the legal protection of accident victims can be improved . #% Frankly , if we were to be paid nothing there are some begrudgers and commentators who would still raise questions . #% I welcome the Commission 's assurance that any distortion of trade which might arise as a result of these labelling measures will be dealt with . #% Since 1985 there has been a provision in the technical measures regulation to allow Member States to impose stricter measures for their own fishermen in EU waters . #% Secondly , in the measures to assist beef producers who have lost money , will he be proposing that all beef producers who have suffered serious loss will be compensated . #% In relation to price inflation , which is one of the issues addressed in the Council ' s recommendation to Ireland , it is important that we are clear on the following key statistics : the latest figures show that inflation as measured by the harmonised European index has fallen from 6 % last November to 3.9 % this year . #% In fact , it is ironic that the governments of the new Member States are the ones giving the lead on how to resolve the financial perspectives issue . #% In other words , there is a certain discrepancy between national growth and regional cohesion . #% It is clear that the issue of tax harmonisation is not high on the agenda of the work of the Convention . #% She is following up the work of Members right across the political spectrum including , of course , Mr Mombaur and Mr Robles Piquer . #% in writing . - I support this report , which asserts that the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement must be consistent with the actual global crisis and be carried out in a way that fully respects a partnership of equals . #% However , there is an urgent need for greater cooperation between the 25 Member States ' enforcement agencies , especially now that our land borders , post-enlargement , have increased by over one third to more than 3 000 km and also because of the acknowledged links between the significant , though unquantified , illegal wildlife trade and organised crime . #% They are enormous responsibilities because they relate to the way people will lead their lives over the coming decades . #% This is not the way to defend or preserve the Community 's legal right to require the correct implementation of the agreement by Israel . #% Have I understood correctly ? #% Continuing the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports on a voluntary basis in the future does not go far enough . #% It was written and signed in 1957 and it bears all the hallmarks of the philosophy and expectations of that time which are no longer applicable . #% I hope we can see those elections held very soon . #% As an Irish MEP I would strongly urge non-nuclear countries like Ireland to take a stand against this nuclear package and I am sorry that it has not so far done this . #% I welcome the forthcoming communication on enterprise , but I hope that past work will also be looked at before we go ahead with more . #% We would like to see a successful peace process in Spain also and an end to the use of violence for political ends . #% Already some , but not all , Member States are involved in the eurozone and the Schengen Agreement . #% But worst of all , tailoring your response for geopolitical reasons was a total betrayal of the principles underlying election observation , which is designed to enhance democratisation and human rights . #% What exactly are we going to do in relation to Lisbon ? #% I would ask this House to condemn these nuclear tests outright and condemn India for not being part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . #% We should remember we are not dealing with the Atlantic . #% I welcome the fact that we are going to give more responsibility to local fishermen closer to the areas in which they work . #% In my own country we currently have the shortest re-registration period , with only one day allowed . #% Mr President , on the issue of substance in that vote , I want to say on behalf of the Liberal Group how disappointed we are that we did not leave in the hands of Parliament the capacity to deliver by a large majority what Parliament actually believes in . #% Many people have quoted Irish poets over the past few days in the big speeches that have been made , Seamus Heaney in particular , and his line that hope chimes with history . #% If it were not for the common agricultural policy , that would have been very painful . #% I would ask the President to bring this back to the Council if possible . #% We therefore call on the Council to withdraw its proposal and , as stated in the report , call on the Commission or the Council to make a declaration in plenary on a proposal for a new Europol decision , which shall be submitted six months following the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon . #% What better way to discharge the ministerial portfolio than to encourage their friends to stop this activity . #% In my view , the Conference of Presidents rightly considers that this House should express a political view on that matter at an early date . #% We must not overlook the fact that pesticides play an important role in modern agriculture : using pesticides efficiently can increase crop yields and help maintain high standards of food quality and safety . #% In this context the support for agriculture - it is substantial and I acknowledge that because it represents almost 50 % of the entire budget - must be seen also as a subsidy to consumers . #% The recent application by BNFL to the British Government for increased area discharges is another unpleasant episode in the ongoing saga of Sellafield and Thorp nuclear plants . #% This communication points to a path for developing future policy . #% The programmes in place have the potential to help , but that help must be easier to obtain . #% I have a direct question for the Commissioner . #% However , we were subject to a 4-hour flight delay and were taken to Düsseldorf on route . #% Was this an indictment of the European project or a mid-term wake-up call to our political establishment ? #% I would like to draw the House 's attention to one statement in particular : Zimbabwe 's police chief said yesterday that they must rid their country of ` the crawling mass of maggots ' . #% Those three areas are of vital importance to people who are involved in cutting-edge technology that we do not know about today but will be using in ten or fifteen years ' time . #% Many of these disciplines are extremely profound and have their own practical traditions which are very effective . #% Yes , it is about 40 % of the Community budget at the moment but that reflects more on the size of the Community budget than on spending on agriculture . #% Those farmers get ECU 2 billion from the Union . #% I am told by medical researchers that the amount to be spent on BSE is unrealistically high . #% In the wake of the disaster and the many other catastrophes we have witnessed we can all agree that maritime transport must be made a lot safer and there must be far better coordination of actions in all Member States . #% All stakeholders must be intimately involved in a bottom-up approach if stock recovery is to be achieved . #% All nutritional health claims should be scientifically substantiated according to scientific best practice . #% However , that opinion is not as cast-iron or as tight as we would like to think it is . #% We need to look in a serious way at the decriminalisation of cannabis , and to get serious about serious drugs . #% I recently visited Guatemala with Trocaire , an Irish NGO . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report on the grounds that such moves are important to reaffirm European solidarity at a time when it is being severely put to the test . #% I must say that I have been highly impressed by the efforts of so many people , and in particular I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Sacconi , the shadow rapporteurs , the chairman of our group , Mr Florenz , the Commission and the Council , and all who have compromised to bring about this package . #% I asked if the Conservatives would call in to the Regional Committee now and again so that we could have this report on the agenda nine months ago . #% This point has been made and I want to endorse it . #% I am very glad that such relevant matters as drugs and child prostitution were debated yesterday , as well as all the other matters that are of concern to us here this week in Parliament . #% Can the Commission say that it will seek to have sugar declared a sensitive product ? #% in writing . - Poor corporate governance in financial institutions - and particularly banks ' murky pay culture - was a key factor in creating the conditions for the financial crisis . #% In time the United Nations and the European Union should be given positive roles as new political structures develop in Afghanistan . #% Finally , are we going to get a European framework for investment in R&D , in education , in lifelong learning , so that we can create a genuine engine for growth in Europe ? #% We must strengthen the clinical research capacities in developing countries . #% 
The jury is out . #% We have a great duty to help and protect our constituents at this time of great financial turbulence . #% It seems that profit comes before the interests of the public and the environment . #% Amendment No 6 to the Mombaur report should not be admissible . #% At the time the Spanish Government was criticised for towing the stricken vessel out to sea , ignoring the advice of experts who argued that it should be taken to a sheltered bay or port where the oil could be contained . #% The intention is to show that it is applied in a balanced and proportionate way and it should be stressed that the directive must not be used to abuse the right of legitimate competitors to enter the market place , in particular that for generic medicines . #% It is for politicians to make these balanced choices . #% Not for the first time do I want to put on the record that in all of this sorry debacle , farmers were the innocent victims of circumstances which were beyond their control . #% We are talking about war and peace . #% The British Government now assures us that the rules on the disposal of offal and contaminated feed have been strengthened , are being rigorously enforced and are now watertight . #% You have to address the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today . #% in writing . - The recent earthquake in Haiti demonstrates to us all how fragile living on this earth can be . #% We must learn from this experience and ensure that we do not repeat the same mistake . #% Many of the underlying causes of the unsustainable bushmeat trade also cause poverty : weak local governance and unfavourable terms of trade . #% This requirement may well provide a useful opportunity for the authorities to identify the assets of criminals and to take appropriate action . #% Compared to the US and Japan , we are woefully lacking in a proper research strategy in almost all Member States except Finland , Sweden and the Republic of Ireland - countries shown in the Commission paper to have had unusual success . #% Ryanair , whose owners and senior managers had been very substantial financial beneficiaries of air transport liberalization , must immediately enter into dialogue with these employees who seek to be represented by a trade union of their choice and to utilize the resources of the national procedures that exist . #% I have spoken before of the need for imaginative gestures from both sides in this conflict . #% Mr President , thank you for allowing me to intervene at this point ; I realise there are a lot of votes to get through . #% He had the right to intervene and I regret that he was not facilitated as others were . #% We know , however , that recovery can not happen without pain . #% I would like the Commissioner to address that particular point . #% We had a very good example where your colleague , Commissioner Vivien Reding , Commissioner for Information and Media , took a very tough stand with the mobile phone companies - and we can see the result to the benefit of the consumer . #% These people should be brought to justice . #% I hope that the presidency will have the opportunity to expedite the removal of the remaining difficulties , by bringing fully into play the role and opportunities available through Europol 's operational capabilities . #% On 22 April the Competition Council will be meeting behind closed doors to decide on the future of the Services Directive , a directive in which millions of European citizens have taken an active role and active interest . #% The wide-ranging recommendations contained in the report should be implemented , and soon . #% UNICEF justifiably earned the respect of countries and agencies everywhere for its programmes of oral rehydration , breastfeeding promotion , and primary education . #% First of all I would say that anything that we decide in a democratic way , through the institutions of the Union , about own resources , is what own resources are . #% So what we require of him is to look after those millions of unemployed and to take that into account . #% Physical degradation of housing stock denies its occupants the right to decent living conditions and is a major obstacle to integration and social cohesion . #% It is important that the European Parliament continue to monitor developments in Hong Kong and this report provides an important update on many issues , not least on Article 23 , the proposed anti-sedition legislation , on which we passed a resolution in December 2002 . #% The Brazilian Government , however , has been more than reluctant to help , and even more reluctant to ask for international aid . #% We want peace - yes , but not at any cost . #% All the EU can do at this point is to address the consequences of the situation . #% I hope that at the end of this discussion we will have a resolution that will be overwhelmingly supported by this Parliament and , in its own way , will create an impetus for support for the overall resolution in the UN General Assembly . #% Is that deal affected by the Council 's decision ? #% But if we have a common interest in the environment , a common interest in the economic welfare of the European Union , a common tourism policy and so on , it is realistic to think that we ought to have a common policy so far as forestry is concerned . #% It can not hide behind other countries which say that they will veto any action taken against Sudan . #% Several months ago the Community agreed with Israel to expand its preferential import quotas on a number of agricultural products that are largely or mainly produced in its illegal settlements , and these are for export to Community markets . #% I look to other legislation to see what analogies or what benefits can be drawn from it . #% Make no mistake , it is Sinn Fein IRA alone that has once again let the people of Northern Ireland down . #% I sat through an earlier debate relating to this today and one might wonder whether Parliament is united in accepting the basic principle of the recommendations of the Scientific Committee . #% But , looking at this rural development plan , which seeks to promote the complementary activities , while reducing and taking money from the primary activity -- family farming -- I can only say the plan is crazy , and in the Irish context , will destroy the very rural communities it purports to enrich . #% In the first instance Parliament will then need to have the work of that committee returned to it and express political conclusions in a debate in the House . #% We do not support jurisdiction clauses because my group also believes that these are in contravention of the unfair contract term legislation , by causing significant imbalance in the parties ' rights and obligations under contract to the detriment of the consumer . #% If the Commissioner is able to give us tonight an appropriate assurance and accept the spirit of that amendment , which asks her to take further action on the withdrawal of inefficient equipment , it is quite possible that we can approve the common position unamended . #% This state company has recently announced its intention to review its entire network , particularly the freight network , with the possibility that it may be closed entirely . #% Ireland 's entitlement is reduced from EUR 3.7 billion for 2000-2006 to EUR 901 million , which is a barometer of our economic success . #% Mr President , when we consider the historic , colonial interference of many European countries in various places around the world , for example Burundi , it is very important that we have this discussion here today on Burundi where government forces have been responsible for extra-judicial killings , disappearances , torture and other serious violations . #% The amount of resources at our disposal is so small and there is so little we can do with them , but there is one area that I would like to see developed . #% It is completely unacceptable that it carries out the same barbaric acts as countries like Iran - it is basically in the same category as Iran . #% I encourage the House to establish common sense and preventative action in the area of floods and flood control . #% Our position is plain and simple and fully in line with the mandate of the Conference of Presidents . #% I believe these changes to vocational education will benefit the economies of all Member States . #% Secondly , there is the ECJ 's consistent case-law according to which there should be a sole legal base which reflects the preponderant purpose or the centre of gravity of the legislation . #% This is the proper approach as taxation matters are best left to be decided by the individual Member States ' governments . #% However , I was looking for something more specific , if possible , under three headings . #% We are aware that diseases such as AIDS , Malaria and Meningitis have no frontiers . #% I thank her for clarifying it . #% We have to look at how we treat asylum seekers and refugees , especially in the current situation where there is a lot of anxiety about what is happening in the former Yugoslavia and the number of refugees there . #% But the one thing we do need for the second pillar of the rural economy is money . #% I have no difficulty with the original political decision of the European Union to help the regions , particularly those of Spain and Portugal , that are highly or partly dependent on fishing . #% We have a duty of care to farmers in the developing world which we can and will discharge in the context of a level world playing field but , as European legislators , our primary duty of care is to our own farmers and to a sustainable future for agriculture in the EU , the largest agricultural producer and the largest economy in the world . #% My latest visit indicated that the peace process there is incredibly fragile , but people take tremendous heart from the fact that Europe is supporting their cause . #% Many of Altiero Spinelli 's recommendations have been included in the Treaties which have been enacted over the last 18 years . #% 
As a result , two fraught days were spent in Copenhagen negotiating a financial package , with divisions at one stage threatening to stall proceedings . #% President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon are meeting this week and I hope that this will signal a more willing involvement on the part of the United States to re-intensify its efforts to reach a political agreement in the region . #% I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination , as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty . #% Consequently we have no right to compromise on the quality of water or to cut deals here on the quality of water . #% It is essential that a common code of conduct applies in all our institutions , so that citizens are not baffled or bamboozled by the response of our institutions to their problems and complaints . #% However , friendship does not mean blindness but the willingness to be honest . #% On 4 March 2002 , our environment minister introduced a plastic bag tax in Ireland , 15 % per bag . #% I have some sympathy with the last speaker : sometimes the Committee on Budgetary Control gets so involved with the important work they are doing , that they are unable to see the wood for the trees . #% Please be careful . #% I welcome the debate that took place this week in Parliament on the uses of alternative energy resources . #% All in all , my group will support the Barzanti report but we urge that our amendments be adopted . #% As the Commissioner himself said , only if public money is used is there any requirement to reduce capacity . #% My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance . #% We bring Sinn Féin 's agenda for change , for Irish unity and independence to this forum . #% Given that earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis have taken place in the past , would it not be prudent for the Commission to set up a benchmarking process to facilitate alert strategies to warn of natural disasters of this kind ? #% To my mind , those are the two key issues with regard to achieving the Lisbon Strategy for the future . #% When we look at the legal systems in many countries , we find the actual application of law is unacceptable . #% While I agree with many of the points made by the Commissioner , we have to be realistic about these matters . #% We have seen many wonderful success stories in the biotech field , the development of genetic insulin for example . #% Russia has enough problems without confronting Chechnya , and it always strikes me that this House is reluctant for the most part to criticise Russia in circumstances such as this . #% These new procedures are also going to have to be monitored in a structured manner , so as to ensure that any discrepancies in the operation of these new schemes within the different Member States of the European Union are ironed out . #% As a result , they enjoy lower pensions later in life . #% Why is it that our services can not give us simple and straightforward information ? #% We believe that one of the measures of the consciousness of the depth of that historic challenge will be found in the reformist appetite of the states in the IGC . #% Young men looking for their first job , if that job involves driving a car in Ireland , have to pay something like ECU 50 for insurance per week . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his tremendous work . #% It did not give us the trade union rights that we so badly need . #% Had all those things been discussed , the optimism would have been much less . #% Is it in a position to prove its credentials in fighting international terrorism , or is it only interested in ducking its responsibility ? #% I would underline to Commissioner Potočnik that it is absolutely imperative that Community funding for research be substantially increased under the Seventh Framework Programme . #% However , no barriers can protect us from the forces of globalisation . #% There is a view that consumers are only engaging in buying CDs , books , low-value items , but of course we know that e-commerce is taking off in such way that soon they will be buying financial services , they will be buying cars . #% My final point is that much mention has been made recently in Parliament of the ongoing work of the European Convention . #% I would like to agree with what the rapporteur says : the consumer must be looked after , and that means competition . #% The Cairo conference term ` reproductive health ' was defined by the World Health Organisation as including the term ` fertility regulation ' which includes the term ` interrupting unwanted pregnancy ' , i.e. abortion . #% But you will not resolve the problems of the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe by simply turning a blind eye and pretending they do not exist , nor by allowing President Mugabe to leave the country and attend conferences . #% It is a chemical usher that leeches these other poisons into the water and then transfers them to body tissue and bone . #% Far better that than to increase income tax by 2 % . #% I welcome the recent comments of Prime Minister Simitis , when he stated that the United Nations is the forum that must be used to address the issues raised in the UN inspectors ' report on Iraq . #% If it is not the case , they must not treat the decision as an irrelevancy . #% We strongly support your efforts to put pressure on certain governments , which keep their markets closed while they take advantage of open markets elsewhere . #% It is a small part of what is needed . #% What I do ask , Mr President , is whether you , on behalf of the presidency , are in a position consistent with Rule 138 , to make a clear declaration at this time as to what is the position and what is the result of the vote cast . #% That is why I believe we have to be far more specific and look at the directive sector by sector , at the existing providers of services . #% Our culture needs to encourage men to step up to the plate . #% I thank the Presidency for that reply . #% That some Irish members should vote against such a proposal is incomprehensible given that the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions in Dublin would be in line to carry out such work . #% We have invasive alien species here , over 40 % of the EU 's species -- both flora and fauna -- are under threat , and yet we have no debate on this issue during a designated Green Week . #% Unfortunately , what has been forgotten in the debate , discussion and media coverage , is that there were also many peaceful protests , where Muslims and non-Muslims came together because they found the cartoons and the images they represented offensive , not to their religious belief , but to them as human beings . #% I would like to congratulate all my colleagues , particularly Mr Sturdy for initiating it , the Chairman Mrs Redondo Jiménez and the rapporteur Mr Kreissl-Dörfler . #% New contracts in other Member States will help to bring that prospect about and are therefore to be welcomed . #% The fact that it makes them look ridiculous , takes up our time and diverts us from dealing with really important issues that affect the everyday lives of European citizens obviously does not matter to them . #% This truly would be an enabling exercise . #% The European Union has brought political stability to the people of Europe for over 50 years . #% There are so many examples of how not to do it , but it is only through enlightened policies and through those of us who believe in democracy and human rights working together that terrorism can be fought and permanently eradicated . #% It also pressures applicant and Third World countries to become part of an EU market-place for human embryo research . #% I particularly support the principles contained in the report concerning access for all regardless of income or wealth , high quality of care , and financial sustainability of care systems . #% They too have a role . #% Mr President , I have campaigned long and hard for the establishment of a European coastguard , and in the light of numerous maritime accidents and incidents that have occurred in recent years , the case for such a maritime force has never been stronger . #% Why are we paying to have empty fields and rusting equipment , when we need sugar production more than ever . #% If the Union had had the job of policing the catching of fish , we might have had some success . #% I very much support the goal of the European Commission that half of all Internet connections must be by broadband facility by the year 2005 within the European Union . #% The publishing industry feels that there is a lack of recognition of its particular requirements with regard to the expanding IT sector . #% Initiatives by the international community , focused on obtaining a political settlement , must ensure that human rights issues are addressed at every stage of the peace and democratisation process . #% It was quite unfair that , of all people , John Tomlinson should have been singled out . #% Safer travel for air passengers in Europe must at all times be the ultimate objective for EU governments and EU airlines . #% 
It is a point which deserves particular attention well in advance of the actual introduction of the currency . #% Again , I compliment and congratulate my colleague , Mr Ribeiro e Castro , on his very extensive and constructive approach to this important report . #% That would be a difficult decision and I hope it will not be necessary but it is a constitutional requirement under Article 48 that this House should give an opinion before an IGC even though , regrettably , we have no right of assent after an IGC . #% It is rather unfair that if you are at the back of the Chamber or if you are not at least six foot tall , you can not gain attention . #% Let us not forget that some countries have only transposed the framework decision in the last number of months . #% The three amendments which I have tabled are consistent with the points I have just raised and they are also consistent with the traditional approach of this Parliament . #% I am confident that , under the Belgian Presidency of the European Union , extensive progress will be made with regard to the enlargement negotiations . #% In Ireland , partly because of our own inaction and through our own fault , we currently have a nitrates directive based on rainfall , weather and climate , which is totally unworkable , but that is another story . #% The only thing I want to say to the Commissioner is , could he please tell us which advice he is taking ? #% Regarding the post-delivery verification system , once Israel declares where the goods come from , there is no way that a Member State can legally challenge that verification . #% Indeed , as the rapporteur and the Commissioner have both said , it also cuts down on red tape . #% To such a proposal , I categorically say no . #% Not in the first instance in court where the average cost for a cross-border case is EUR 2 500 and it takes between 23 and 29 months to resolve . #% The European Union is in a very powerful position to do this . #% Members of this Parliament hail from 15 different sovereign states and are aware that company law differs widely from one Member State to another . #% After what Mary O'Rourke our Transport Minister has achieved in the Transport Council , you should be more optimistic about the outcome of the Ecofin meeting . #% To rectify our demographic crisis we must restore the basic integrity of human relationships . #% First of all , may I take the opportunity of congratulating the rapporteur . #% We were well placed because of our links with the ACP countries , although there was an issue over their waiver which clouded the discussions , and because we have always worked well with NGOs . #% Little wonder that we can not compete . #% I know that the Dublin Foundation greatly appreciates the efforts Mr KellettBowman has made and for the measured response in his report . #% I say to him to leave such archaic nonsense to Sinn Féin , from whom one expects no better . #% Thank you for your answer , Madam President-in-Office , I appreciate it . #% This legislation , if it includes self-employed , will be virtually unenforceable . #% Parliament was represented , I was present , and I think you struck exactly the right note for Parliament . #% In fact , we have the most rigorous animal welfare regulations enshrined in Irish law and we are fully enforcing them . #% No studies , analyses or reports of any kind have been provided on the economic and social impact of the drastic changes that the Commission would like to make to the structural policy on fisheries . #% This will ultimately serve to increase our competitiveness and strengthen the economy in rural areas . #% In particular , I am glad that at all times they fully respected the role of Parliament and its Members . #% Considering that this is something like 48 % of the entire budget - EUR 38 or 39 billion - it is quite an achievement , spent over fifteen countries , that the budget was within two and a half per cent of estimate and that waste and the possibility for loss were lower than the average for the budget . #% The Convention , of which I was a member , painstakingly constructed a blueprint for the kind of Europe I have just outlined . #% I would refer her to the comments of her colleague , the Austrian Foreign Minister , earlier on today in Parliament , when he said that job creation would be the top priority of the presidency and that under the Amsterdam Treaty the EU now had the necessary instruments available via national employment plans in specific and binding areas . #% I want to point out that President McAleese apologised fulsomely and without reservation within hours of making the remarks . #% Yes , we in Ireland have made rapid progress towards the EU average in GDP but - yes - we still need new significant levels of funding for the period ahead if we are to consolidate our economic progress achieved to date . #% Klaus , if I may call you that , you have added value to the presidency of this House . #% As for weapons of mass destruction , I agree that somebody like Saddam Hussein should not have control of them , but there are others in the region who should not either . #% Does the Commissioner not accept that the Community interest is not served , nor is the competitiveness of the EU textile industry served , by the imposition of such duties ? #% Member States must make a payment towards the central budget to ensure that we can assist those countries most in need , and to ensure that we can continue to drive forward Europe as a dynamic , innovative and creative centre . #% I remember a plan was produced which was based on two simple things : intensive advice and a little bit of financial incentive . #% The days of kid-glove treatment for drug pushers and the unseen drug barons must end . #% in writing . - I voted for the Maňka Report which is the first step in amending the 2010 European Parliament budget seeking additional budgetary and human resources to enable the European Parliament to fulfil its enhanced role . #% After all , the Council is there to give a strategic lead . #% In fact President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak have already signed the memorandum to implement the Wye River Accord and to resume the final status negotiations . #% Certainly there are very serious food shortages . #% Far too often the concerns and interests of our peoples are ignored in the headlong rush to advance the federalist agenda exemplified in the Lisbon Treaty . #% This agreement with the European Commission provides only for voluntary registration , even though lobbyists not included in the joint register will no longer be able to obtain a long-term access badge to the European Parliament . #% The Sixth Framework Programme gives us an opportunity to look at research and I hope that tomorrow , Commissioner , you will join with us in looking forward to a more intelligent use of energy in the European Union . #% However , there are three reasons why I ask this question . #% While a lot more work is needed prior to any legislative initiative from the Commission - and I welcome Commissioner Bolkestein 's offer of a second round of consultation - the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has laid out its stall , proposing separate core settlement services as a user-owned or public service , governed by the rules of non-profit status . #% I made it very clear that I am obliged to abstain from giving an assessment or commentary on statements made outside formal Council meetings . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Redondo for her report and for her excellent explanation of what all this is about and why it is important . #% I also restate my view that the compensation proposed is totally inadequate and must be immediately increased . #% No normal process of law has been put into effect against them . #% There are many other issues I would like to raise , including the Guantanamo prisoners and the appalling suffering of the Palestinian people , but time does not permit me to do so . #% If accepted by the Council and actually implemented by fishermen , they will doubtless result in fewer juvenile fish and nontargeted species being caught and discarded . #% in writing . - Over the last 50 years , European women have made huge progress towards gender equality . #% Regional and cohesion policies can be successful if everyone works together - the Member States , the regions and the local authorities . #% As I have just said , the Council has not received a Commission proposal and if we do the Council will certainly act on such a proposal . #% The turnaround has been dramatic and there have been few complaints . #% Did he get patients off a two-year waiting list for minor operations ? #% We must not encourage people to infringe copyright . #% We still have not even the slightest idea of how many are missing here in Europe . #% I salute her for being one of the few genuine revolutionaries in this House since , on this issue , she has never stopped spinning . #% Fontainebleau was Margaret Thatcher 's Agincourt , when she walked away with the British rebate , and now , 20 years on , that rebate is worth a farthing in the pound of British GDP . #% It seems to me that is a mistake . #% Both are worthy applications . #% 
Finally , I would like to refer briefly to the ethical aspects of research . #% We need to know what these substances are and make sure that they are properly tested . #% We need a revised treaty that is truly relevant to the needs of ordinary people . #% The political declaration they adopted requires governments to implement new strategies and programmes to reduce drug demand , and new laws to counter money laundering by 2003 . #% Madam President , I am sorry that the spirit of Christmas is not prevailing . #% As we ponder these choices , the latest European buzzword has been thrown into the debate by the Commission and Member States - that of flexibility . #% There is no doubt that the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive needs updating after 15 years in force . #% In other words , 19 % of people entitled to vote voted `` no '' and signalled an unwillingness to proceed with enlargement , because that was what Nice was about . #% I called for the question to be amended to ask the Council to ensure a fair and free ratification procedure . #% Such a defeat would be a victory for the eurosceptics . #% I am a patron of an organisation in Ireland called Women 's Aid . #% It is important , in view of safety , that the Commission carries out an assessment of the impact of the regulation on rosters and operating models and , in the event that they are adversely affected , the Commission should carry out an assessment and propose an adjustment of the provisions regarding flight and duty time limitations . #% I am not saying that that feeling is widespread , but it is spreading , and I think that is why our words here have to be translated into action . #% There is also a strong recommendation to provide consumers with manufacturers ' contact addresses where goods are sold in several Member States . #% The Dioxin and BSE debates failed to get across the strong message that the quality of European food is the best in the world , and consumers get both quality and value for money . #% There is a view that there should be separate rules for scrapie rather than the current mix of rules where the treatment of SRM in sheep depends on the BSE incidence in that particular country . #% I sat in on Question Time yesterday and the President-in-Office refused to answer virtually every single supplementary question put to him . #% The Israelis and Palestinians must resume the search for peace and the two sides must act together and they must act in tandem . #% At the same time , however , it would be unwise to underestimate the importance of risk management in the traditional areas of credit and market risks . #% Perhaps he could give an answer when he comments on the debate later on . #% For my part , I am wary of suggestions to introduce new forms of taxation . #% The authorities have declared that women will be entitled to vote in the future . #% I think we have reached an agreement with the Commission that information will be provided to us at intervals and in a form that allows us to monitor that spending in the way we want to . #% This is an ever-changing situation and the inherent dangers are very great . #% I wonder if Mr Fischler is in a position to consider that farmers should must farm 80 % or more of their land ? #% As I said in reply to the honourable Member , in practice it is vital for the success of these missions that the state which they intend to visit should cooperate . #% I welcome higher standards , but I want the same everywhere . #% I want to ask the Commission if it agrees with me that in the present climate , when the European Commission is being put into a position of banning so many products and processes - even research itself in some instances - it is extremely important that what we do is seen to be soundly based and reliable . #% I welcome this new Community programme , which brings together four previous programmes and seeks to streamline them and to provide more money for their implementation . #% Two-thirds of flight hold-ups are due to congestion in the skies . #% ( Applause ) I would ask the Commissioner in fairness to withdraw his remarks on the European Parliament finding itself unanimous in only one respect , namely in opposing the Commission . #% This experience should now be put to good use in the interests of the people of Iraq . #% Mr President , 20 years ago an eminent health pathologist warned that she had never examined a cancerous tumour that did not have chemicals from the benzene family in the active reproducing cancer cells . #% In relation to the Commission 's proposal , many of the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee were not taken on board in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , but I hope the amendments that have been tabled will be supported when the vote takes place . #% The Western military/industrial complex had a field day and poured its weapons into Baghdad . #% There is no great difference between the expressed sympathies of the Members and the response of the presidency . #% I believe the Red Cross should be given immediate access to detainees , international monitors should be introduced and arbitrary detention must be brought to an end . #% With modern technology and proper animal coding , this procedure , as we now know , is possible and is already considerably advanced in my own country , Ireland , where we have pioneered a traceability programme in the lamb trade - the first within the European Community . #% I tried to establish how other States deal with this problem and I find the only comparable systems are in the United States and the Netherlands . #% With that target in mind , and as we are now making long-term energy choices , we should be phasing out nuclear plants over the coming years across Europe . #% One might also think that there would be a relationship between suicide and major economic factors such as unemployment and poverty levels . #% My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations . #% Compensation measures for beef price reductions are included in the new draft regulations , but more work needs to be carried out to guarantee that Irish and European farmers are fully protected when the new euro changeover takes place . #% It requires a longer approach ; it requires more involvement of other presidencies ; it requires more involvement of other Member States . #% For example , some rare breeds of cattle , now almost extinct , may provide disease resistant traits and food producing improvements when cross-bred with conventional breeds . #% He is then liable to what amounts to a waste tax for merely handling the goods and , in addition , has to waste time and effort on trying to assess the weight of the packaging . #% Water pricing policy is also a taxation issue . #% A second alternative -- and the one that I recommend -- is to consider that science and research are positive , that the results of that work are of benefit to human beings and that this allows dialogue and provides an opening for work with Palestinians . #% Last year , this Parliament roundly condemned Sinn Féin -- the IRA -- for its continuing criminal activities . #% Any actions that we can take here must seek to enforce best practices and ideas . #% In addition to CAP support and measures , an allocation of IEP 80m has been provided in the regional operational programme for investment in harvesting equipment , forest roads and general woodland improvements . #% The Commission has very little control over how money is spent and has publicly admitted as much . #% I call on those Member States which , for political reasons , are continuing to block the lifting of the ban , to start looking at the objective , scientific evidence . #% In this case , as in the ozone depleting substances regulation to which this proposal is related , that is environmental protection . #% We are all aware that President Bush is due to meet the European Union leaders in Göteborg this week . #% This Parliament should take its role seriously in protecting fish stocks and not just protect basic selfish national interests . #% However , these were not binding on the Member States . #% We can be assured that any report by Mr Oostlander is backed by a great sense of purpose and integrity . #% Mr President , I understand the need to maintain the integrity of the telecoms package , but I understand there have been some final changes to the declaration the Commission has issued on ` must carry ' rules . #% I trust this Parliament will continue to condemn those who fail to share our commitment to fundamental freedoms . #% We want the citizens of Europe to know that everything possible has been done to keep them safe . #% It is essential that we do not allow the European Commission to introduce a single instrument in such matters . #% Without the EU 's efforts , I do not think the Summit would have made as much progress . #% Therefore some role must be found for Parliament in the interactions between the social partners . #% Such drove me to vote against the resolution . #% But this time it is extremely serious . #% 
I also endorse those amendments that exclude from the scope of this directive any cells or tissues that are derived from cloned material . #% Mr President , I welcome the report by my colleague Mr McCartin , which deals with many of the problems of the fishing industry . #% I welcome the initiative of those in my constituency who are proactively working on developing a product to meet the necessary stringent demands of European legislation . #% Mr President , tourism in any region should be a positive contributor to economic growth and stability . #% The French government should follow the example of the British government . #% You need only look at everything we have at our disposal , and at the costs incurred in this senseless slaughter of thousands of innocent animals . #% I congratulate the rapporteur for his handling of this report through three readings and lengthy negotiations with the Council in the conciliation process . #% It will allow more business to operate on the new e-economy , and will also get rid of some of the uncertainty and some of the difficulties there are with regard to the different domains that exist at present . #% Many of us who have served loyally on the European Parliament 's Committee on Fisheries for many years have found ourselves sidelined in the interests of expediency . #% Whereas the level of funding must in particular meet the needs of the less-developed Irish subregions , it is my view that they should cover the whole country during the entire seven-year period of the next financial framework . #% In my own region , the Greater Manchester Obscene Publications Unit has had success in cracking down on paedophilia with new Internet tracing software . #% Thus a funding formula reliant on a smash-and-grab raid on the single farm payment through excessive modulation is simply not acceptable , particularly in circumstances where there is no necessity for matching national funding . #% Nepal has accepted a compromise put forward by the UNHCR who has been playing an important role in seeking to help to resolve the impasse . #% Following the costs incurred by taxpayers during the crisis , it is essential that we ensure the financial sector contributes fully and fairly to an improvement in public finances . #% As Mr Watson rightly said , 40 journalists have been killed in Russia in the last two and a half years . #% But at the moment the high risk is with the dairy herd , the six and seven year-old cows and that is why , since I spoke last year , we have had the destruct scheme that was announced on 13 December 2000 , if I recall correctly , that will be in place until the end of this year . #% I would have preferred a stronger resolution but I know how difficult it is to achieve that . #% In conclusion , let me , along with other Members of this House , wish you , all members of Parliament staff , the Commissioner , all members of Commission staff , and all who serve this Parliament a very happy and peaceful Christmas and a prosperous New Year . #% It is not equal treatment when one organisation can receive funding without needing to make a proposal to the Commission , and yet other organisations must compete against many other worthwhile proposals . #% I would like to suggest to the Minister that this is potentially an important industry within the European Union . #% Since then there have been no more exchange rate risks and , in theory , the cost to consumers of transferring money across borders and of changing cash from one euro-zone currency to another should have reduced sharply . #% They must be looked after . #% Certainly , as rapporteur last year , I saw a huge amount of duplication between the report produced by Parliament and the one the Council produced . #% Nonetheless , the United States ' Pentagon website has posted a list of 63 so-called favoured countries which President Bush wants to include in the bidding process for USD 18 billion of contracts to rebuild Iraq . #% It is important to put on the record that , while EU consumers always had access to quality food , the effectiveness of new controls and greater transparency in the food chain provide the additional safeguards necessary to allay fears resulting from isolated incidents and indeed the unforgivable incident which this House is addressing this morning . #% My question is related to Mr Smith 's question . #% It is also important to make it clear that retailers who import pre-packaged products directly from third countries are also subject to EU regulation . #% As has already been highlighted by other speakers within this Parliament , there are a number of contradictions and elements within this combined report which will cause us difficulties in the future . #% We must also support the SDLP campaign for a PEACE 111 programme by earmarking $ 200 million in the 2007-2013 budget . #% The problems of the industry have built up a great degree of resentment . #% Car manufacturers , the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars . #% But I will move on as time is too precious to waste . #% In particular , I support the rapporteur where she asks that the Commission take into account state aid granted by the EU 's international competitors . #% If our experience since 1994 can show us anything , it is that first of all we must ensure that all social policy is predicated on the basis of delivering results for people - not just merely massaging figures , but actually making people 's lives better . #% In conclusion , I wish to put on the record again my appreciation of the Commissioner 's commitment to agriculture and to rural development . #% There is something wrong with a system that allows that off the coastal waters of Ireland . #% So , as a member of the Consumer Protection Committee , I have at all times , along with Mrs Kuhn and Mr Whitehead , supported measures that will ensure that the needs and concerns of consumers are given real and appropriate protection by means of European legislation . #% From a European perspective , the main purpose of this charter would be to ensure that European companies and organisations can fully participate in the opportunity offered by the Internet and electronic commerce so as to avoid premature and conflicting regulations and to ensure that the interests of consumers are safeguarded at all times . #% As regards travel expenses , ever since I came here it has been an issue that has been raised by many people , especially people in my own group . #% On the other hand , it has to be questionable whether a nine-hour cap on the transport of animals is legally possible in the single market . #% His comments are summed up in his last letter to me some weeks ago : `` the process is clearly designed to discourage small inventors and favours large business equipped with legal and patent expertise to navigate its treacherous bureaucracy . '' #% I have been bullied and harassed by lobbyists . #% Would the Commissioner not agree that there is considerable discontent amongst the fishermen involved who feel that they have been displaced , not because of any scientifically based conservation programme , but simply for political reasons , to enable their catches to be exploited by others who have a different traditional way of exploiting stocks ? #% We need to breathe new life into the round . #% In conclusion , in my opinion , one of the most important aspects of conservation of seeds and animals is the ever increasing possibilities in the area of biotechnology which these genetic resources may provide for the absolute benefit of a rapidly growing world population , much of which is already undernourished in many regions of the southern hemisphere . #% In condemning the way the US is spending its foreign aid , Amendment 5 presumes a mandate that this House and this Union simply do not have . #% In our once flourishing sugar industry , the lights have been switched off and the door closed in our last factory . #% We have misgivings about your approach . #% We must have improved scientific information : there can be no broad-brush approach , as has been said . #% Following on from what you have said , President-in-Office , on the division of labour -- some countries are obviously more able to provide logistical support than others -- I would like to ask whether there is any coordination as regards who can best implement the various facets of the operations , or is that still a matter for bilateral relations between Member States ? #% The peace of mind which the families of these ` disappeared ' need is more important than the security and safety of the perpetrators of these murders . #% I hope that common sense will prevail . #% On the back of the new directives which are being enacted in the telecom sector , the European Union will catch up with the US sooner rather than later . #% It is high time that strong sanctions were imposed . #% That is why I abstained in this vote . #% A petition by over 3 , 000 people with disabilities throughout the Community resulted in my report which I am proud to say was passed unanimously last December . #% We hear all the time that the Unionist population in Northern Ireland feel that they are under siege and under threat . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I should like to speak briefly in support of this motion from the PPE-DE Group and the ALDE Group . #% Ignoring now what is accepted as a real threat will only make the final solution more difficult to achieve . #% Perhaps their difficulties serve the hidden agenda of some who do not have to courage to say openly that family farms do not have a future in the Europe of a new millennium . #% The Irish people has spoken on Nice and its decision will be respected . #% I would like to keep the date and I can accept the fallback as an addition to the text , if that meets with the approval of the House . #% I want to see real responsibility , and not a minimal consultation because if that is what we end up with it will not work . #% They should do this next Tuesday at the meeting of the Transport Council . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for all her hard work on this report . #% Also , it is fundamental that , under the guise of better lawmaking , alternatives to legislation be examined . #% 
The Parliament resolution does not make reference to this , but I would like to put on record that concurrent to trafficking in adults , there is growing trafficking in children for prostitution and paedophile activities . #% To those who would say that it is only a semantic distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning , I say : I have a butcher 's knife in my hand , I can cut up your steak with it quite legally , or I can cut your head off with it quite illegally - proper sanctions , proper penalties . #% This regulation will allow consumers to avoid buying products containing non-textile parts of animal origin , whether for health , ethical or other considerations . #% There has also been the question of giving certainty with regard to some form of uniformity : not a harmonisation but a uniformity of sanctions and penalties as they apply across the Member States . #% Jeggle and Souchet often cause me little problems but Mr Cunha 's report is different . #% The present situation , with 15 different Member States implementing 15 different customs regimes , is not conducive to success . #% I also wish to acknowledge and sincerely thank Members of this House for their support for the peace process . #% The Americans must not be allowed to call for an end to export refunds while they continue to operate a host of schemes which have exactly the same effect as far as American farmers are concerned . #% in writing . - I support this report on the work of the African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) - EU Parliamentary Assembly . #% Our real goal must be to plan and give our support to the successful implementation of these funds to improve the life prospects of people in our poorest regions . #% Therefore reference to the role of the family should be , I believe , included in the European Community Youth Programme , which hopes to analyse the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people . #% But moral issues matter to those people that we represent . #% There have been numerous bilateral talks but so far a final political settlement has not been secured . #% I trust that this directive will assist in their achievement of that status . #% I have spoken before in this House about the dramatic sights I have seen on the streets of Gaza city , where animals were eating the flowers and strawberries that were part of the Palestinian exports from Gaza to Europe . #% We will , of course , monitor the Commission 's progress to deliver on these provisions . #% I compliment Mr Cornelissen on his excellent report . #% I should like to say to you , Mr Prodi , directly on behalf of my group , not as advice nor as an instruction but as a suggestion that you might like to think about , that you should seek in the coming days - and especially tomorrow in your dialogue with the European Council - to assert your own independence , not just of the needs of this House , but of some of the parameters of the Council itself . #% I concur with what colleagues have said and also express my frustration with the exclusion of the parliamentary delegation from the daily coordination meetings . #% The debilitating effect of these diseases affects families , communities and economies throughout the developing world . #% I believe that it sends out the wrong signal , at a time when public confidence in Europe is suffering , and that the common agricultural policy is damaged by any mention of cofinancing . #% The presidency needs to produce some sort of strategy to bring an end to the existence within the European Union of parallel data protection systems and the proliferation of monitoring authorities - for example Schengen , Europol or customs conventions . #% Seven countries are considering opt-outs from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court . #% As you are all aware , this is a matter of deep concern to the Irish people , who are particularly upset that there will be increased shipments of nuclear material through the Irish Sea in the near future . #% This gives greater protection to local fishermen , who are quite capable of exploiting every resource within that limit . #% I have known him for a long time and I am absolutely certain that he means what he says in this particular report . #% Why , therefore , is it necessary for this groundwater directive also to deal with nitrates ? #% I thank him for his very kind wishes . #% Moreover some of the proposals passed today concerning the definitions of intentional infringement and commercial scale threaten to remove the discretion of trained and qualified national judges to take the circumstances of each individual case into account . #% As Commissioner Prodi has said , all European institutions need to step up their commitment to simplify regulations in order to reduce the cost of doing business in Europe and increase legal certainty for citizens . #% We are playing into his hands by ensuring that people are denied access to medicines , food and the other necessities of life . #% While I welcome and support the dialogue and the development of a positive relationship between the European Union and China , removal of the arms embargo in the immediate term is still premature . #% For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago . #% I believe that great sensitivity , tolerance and compassion must be employed whenever it is proposed to employ the environmental standards of a developed economy to the economies and environments of emerging economies . #% But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission . #% I am deeply disappointed and saddened by the decision to close the last sugar factory in Ireland . #% The only response that the European Union and its Member States can make to this and to the current attempts by the United States to generate a war psychology in relation to Iraq is to stand together . #% We want them to be more equitable , less environmentally and socially damaging and consistent with other Community policies . #% In conclusion , we must reappraise the proposals in Agenda 2000 for Europe 's beef sector and , in the context of world trade talks , provide a greater degree of protection and opportunity for Europe 's beef farmers . #% At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end , and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies , where we fit into UN agencies and so on . #% I want to ask the Commissioner very straightforwardly and point-blank whether the Commission , and Parliament , and the European Union are being held to ransom by Morocco because of its unwillingness to agree . #% In this House we have a duty to deal with the facts , not to listen to the jungle drums beating from misinformed sources . #% At the Vienna Summit it was clear that some Member States at least preferred to view this package in the narrowest possible manner as an accounting exercise . #% The BSE crisis in the UK has almost ruined our export markets . #% A savage murder was ordered outside a pub in Belfast less than four months ago , carried out by psychopaths , witnessed by 70 to 80 people . #% ICES talks of drawing a line in the sand , but ministers and industry and many of the politicians even seem to be burying their heads in the sands , and this is the problem . #% The URBAN initiative will allow for projects to be undertaken in these areas to tackle the ingrained problems of long-term unemployment and urban decay . #% We need deeper knowledge in science and technology . #% Would you confirm that the Dutch presidency has amendments to the Euratom Treaty on the table at the moment , during the IGC process and that it will look at those amendments and/or institute a review of the Euratom Treaty itself during the IGC negotiations ? #% In fact , in Ireland when we bring this issue up during the referendum process , we are told that it is not going to happen . #% We have seen the success of rural development programmes , including the LEADER scheme and other such activities which have helped create much needed employment in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas throughout Europe . #% Those numbers do not take into account the fresh water from melting ice sheets and glaciers , which could at least double the sea-level rise caused by thermal expansion alone . #% The Good Friday Agreement is an historic achievement and I wholeheartedly congratulate all those who contributed to it , both Governments and the party leaders , particularly John Hume who has been praised here today , John Alderdice and especially David Trimble who has had the courage to lead Unionism to an honourable deal with their fellow citizens in Northern Ireland . #% Even if we ask the county councils or national governments to collect it and pass it on to us , that does not prevent it from being own-resources . #% We are calling for a comprehensive tax base with regard to mineral oils , and if there are exclusions such as aviation gas or kerosene or natural gas , the Commission should justify these and explain their effect in terms of the operation of the internal market . #% I have been told by some of them that they see working in an EU country as a great opportunity , but I wonder if we ever give a thought to those left behind , especially to the sick . #% You took over at a very difficult period when relations had been fractured between the two key institutions of the Union , the Commission and the Parliament . #% ICAT really does mean business and other people should follow suit . #% As such it is an ambitious and wide-ranging directive , very much in line with the agenda set out in the Commission 's action plan for skills and mobility . #% I highlighted to him last night , in the context of our discussion on Mr Miller 's report tonight , that when the issue of abolition of duty - and tax-free sales arose an excise question arose , namely where excise would be paid on sales etc. . #% We know that a fiscal black hole is opening up in the area of pension provision and we just can not ignore it . #% Mr President , the current Russian crisis has profound economic and political implications for the country itself , the region and wider geopolitics . #% A study by the Lough Corrib Angling Federation found that the Irish state agencies were involved in little more than a policy of supervised neglect of western lakes . #% This is a matter of great concern to most citizens . #% Let us be innovative in the European Union . #% One of the elements relating to energy efficiency is that if you turn off your television properly instead of leaving it on standby , you can save 25 % of the electricity that is normally used for a television . #% 
The outlook for the future in terms of securing a permanent peace agreement in the Middle East is , I believe , now more promising than ever . #% It is about promoting sustainable fishing . #% Mr President , I wish to thank the President-in-Office for the information he has given . #% I have experienced this in my everyday life ; I have seen cases in which companies and individuals have been found guilty of abusing Community funds . #% In this regard , I ask the House to take serious note of the fact that the profession of farming is in decline . #% Advertising does have an influence in promoting smoking ; that is why all Member States in Europe have rules which restrict or ban tobacco advertising in some shape or form . #% The other issue I should like to address is the contamination of gene transfer . #% Madam President , many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission ' s statement . #% The Commission will be assisted in its work by a committee made up of representatives of Member States . #% This , in itself , would be a very bold objective . #% These are all key and important elements , but the first thing that we have to overcome , the first barrier that has to be jumped is a psychological barrier and the prejudices within each and every one of us . #% in writing . - It is timely indeed that Parliament addresses this matter only days after the agreement between President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel to seek to change the Lisbon Treaty in order to provide for an orderly handling of future sovereign debt crises in the eurozone . #% It may be that we need extra time rather than applying the clause under Article 42 immediately . #% It follows from this paragraph that a decision not to impose water charges would be in breach of the Directive if it can be linked to the Irish Government 's failure to meet the new standards . #% That will be challenged before the European Court of Justice , as we have been told , and we know the countries that are going to do it . #% Inconsistency and hypocrisy such as this leaves the West in general open to the charge that it is selective in its definition of terrorism and is primarily influenced by the perceived threat to western interests . #% My colleague , Mr Davies - who is not here tonight - has criticised me in committee . #% in writing . - The media law adopted by Hungary 's Parliament is clearly at odds with Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that guarantees freedom of expression and information . #% It has produced a detailed study on the costs of non-social Europe which concluded that , while the so-called costs of social policy are usually immediately visible , the benefits are more difficult to identify and quantify . #% There have been too many incidents , too many scares and too many coincidences of health problems along Ireland 's eastern seaboard . #% I would ask you , Madam President , to take the initiative and request the Commissioner to come to Parliament this week to make an up-to-date statement on this crisis . #% Very sadly , we so often see those who carry out the crime get more sympathy and more support than the victim who was on the receiving end of what happened . #% While we have no objections to further analysis , my delegation would require strong supporting evidence before being able to consider backing such a proposal . #% Mr President , I did not want to interrupt the vote earlier but I should like to refer back to the Nisticò report . #% Throughout Europe , inputting electricity at specific prices is an instrument for gradually dealing with the centralised structure through secure access to the market for decentralised electricity production from renewable sources . #% Finally , once again I express my deepest gratitude to you all for the great support that you give to peace on my own streets . #% Mr President , before I address the subject of today 's debate , it is important that I record in this House the fact that the Irish sugar industry will cease production totally . #% I call on this House and the Justice Commissioner to speak out against this wretched legislation . #% I congratulate Joe Walsh and Brid Rogers for their great cooperation , which resulted in the worst of this outbreak being avoided in Ireland . #% We live in hope , and perhaps a review is the best way forward , as Mrs McNally indicated . #% We already had all the knowledge necessary . #% It could give a lead in trying to do this and I hope that when they meet next week the leaders of our groups will seek to put in place some mechanism to enable Parliament to address this matter . #% I understand why you were unable to do so and I hope your inability to show investment figures shows that in the future nuclear power should not be the main form of energy in this European Union . #% Personally , I am getting increasingly fed up with so-called analyses in newspapers and commentaries on issues of personality which miss the points of substance . #% I congratulate Mr Vitorino on the work that has been brought forward , but Tampere set an agenda and I wonder why , so long after Tampere , we are still struggling to define what that agenda should be . #% No reference has been made to the need for the transfer of prisoners which could go a long way to restoring the IRA cease-fire . #% There are no double damages . #% I hope that will be supported . #% If our Taoiseach 's strategy is to insist upon a European Council declaration that Irish military neutrality is not affected by the Treaty of Nice , then he has once again misrepresented both the Treaty of Nice and Ireland 's role in Partnership for Peace to his own people . #% The alcohol industry portrays alcohol as something that is necessary to enjoy life . #% Indeed , Mr President , as that is happening I have no doubt that the continued support from the European Union and from the European Commission and Council of Ministers in particular , through economic regeneration , will play a major role in strengthening the common ground enormously and in expressing to our people at grass-roots level the massive international goodwill that exists for peace in the offshore island of the European Union . #% By bringing forward a new draft directive greater pressure would be brought to bear on Member States and people in this House to ensure that what is there already will be implemented . #% Father Cullen was engaged in a peaceful protest when he was violently arrested , kicked and handcuffed by the police . #% In response to Mr Colom i Naval , I would say that now is not the time to deal with the very detailed regulations in the Structural Funds : we will look at them when we draw up specific detailed reports . #% I believe we must now decide as a matter of urgency to put procedures in place to ensure that industries can not move simply to take advantage of less stringent controls and , if they do move , that they do not adopt anticompetitive practices to stop somebody else taking their place . #% We have to empower more women at all levels of political representation in Europe . #% It is a nonsense that if a fisherman says something , it must be wrong . #% It is believed that this is the work of British paedophiles who have fled their native country . #% But we , in the Liberal Group , think there can be no more graphic way of confirming this in substance than by his remaining in office to ensure a smooth transition from the first appointee as vicepresident to that person 's successor in office . #% It is time for the EU to get tough on counterfeiting and piracy . #% Hiring one 's dentist to do work of dubious , if any , European value is not acceptable . #% I welcome this Report and the rules for the monitoring and classification of bathing water quality . #% In addition to imposing meaningless uniformity , both proposals would have imposed immense cost on UK bread-makers and milk processors , because of the re-tooling which would have been required . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and to all involved in bringing about this report . #% Mr President , rather than reinvent the wheel and go back over everything that was said , it is important to look at the reality : our population is getting older , living longer and retiring sooner . #% The Council today needs to explain why politically it has scandalously disregarded this capacity for an appropriate flanking measure , because symbolically it is saying to the 18 million unemployed : we frankly do not care about the appropriate mix , we are monetarists and we will do it our way . #% Mr President-in-Office , you were intrigued by the questioner . #% Mr President , it is now clear that a new draft EU Treaty will be presented to our EU leaders in Thessaloniki . #% It is true that , owing to innovation and evolution , many of today 's products offer the consumer more choice and flexibility , but many are difficult for consumers to understand : 56 % of consumers in the UK did not understand the terms used in credit agreements , 77 % find the language in advertising confusing and while 68 % are aware that lenders do not calculate APR in the same way , they do not know how the system works and find it difficult to price one loan against another , which makes it difficult for them to shop around for the best deals . #% I would like to see a democratic , stable assembly in Northern Ireland , where we make our own decisions for our own people and are able to make those decisions work . #% The collapse of the Russian economy and the fall-out from BSE are just some of the problems that are impacting on our beef sector . #% Palestinian freedom will not be obtained by murdering civilians -- terrorism destroys freedom . #% Could I ask Members to put that consideration out of their minds . #% One of the few criticisms I have of this excellent report is that the Commission has not dealt with EMU in a very effective way . #% Too many of our European markets are still too fragmented . #% Farmers already in the EU are facing terrifying difficulties . #% 
The Ombudsman 's office is a direct link between the citizen and Europe ; it enables citizens to make known their concerns about maladministration at European level . #% In many cases , it is as if animals rather than human beings were being brought into the country . #% My group believes that foreign policy is an area where decidedly we need more Europe , including a Europe with a security and defence capacity . #% We need a strategy . #% I welcome the work that has been done in this area , which relates to the whole issue of the perception of the European Union in Member States . #% In that document Mr Bourlanges sets out in paragraphs 7 , 8 and 9 the reasoning behind the conclusion that Parliament does not approve the Council ' s proposals . #% Neither is an adequate solution . #% We would urge the UK authorities to take on board all of our recommendations : apologise , yes , but also compensate those who were so severely affected . #% It states that the parties are a factor for integration , they contribute to the formation of European awareness and are a vital element in the democratic life of the Union and the political debate of the Union . #% The retention of staging posts is important and the question of density also has an impact on the economics of transport . #% The European Union has always been very supportive of my constituency of Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commission , the European Union leaders when they met in Nice last December to review existing treaties had one single objective in mind : they sought to change the internal decision-making procedures within the institutions of the Union to guarantee that enlargement of the European Union could take place . #% I did not believe the justifications given stood up to scrutiny , and this has proven to be the case . #% I think one is needed in the near future indicating how we could achieve more harmonisation - of course not at the lowest standards in existence but at the most stringent . #% The family can then reduce the tax they have to pay by choosing a more energy-efficient car which satisfies the family 's transport needs . #% If one looks at the dangers of cadmium one realises that we must seek out alternatives . #% That report will provide the general assessment of human rights across the globe and of many of the broader questions and challenges , as well as the more local challenges . #% It enshrines among other things the constitutional protection of life , marriage and family and should not be vulnerable to decisions made without the full , informed consent of the Irish people . #% The Commission can also provide badly needed technical aid and expertise to help Russia restructure its economy . #% We also regret that there has not yet been a communication on children 's rights from the Commission . #% The appointment of the new millennium Commission , due to take place in January next , we believe , properly is a matter for the new Parliament with a new mandate , with new political balances and with new powers under Amsterdam . #% Those who oppose the European Union would like to use the events of the last couple of months to highlight disagreement and discord between the existing Member States of the European Union . #% Farmers and rural communities have legitimate expectations , to which Parliament has responded in a positive way . #% There is still clearly a problem there and if we are serious about addressing a 60 % participation of women in the labour market , we have to address the question of equal pay in the review that is being carried out by the Commission . #% Less money from an EU of 25 than from an EU of 15 is not acceptable and is , frankly , irresponsible . #% The company made a very interesting statement after Harland & Wolff were turned down . #% Each Member State will have to put in place procedures which can deal with out-of-court settlements of consumer disputes . #% I am speaking today wearing a number of hats : firstly , as the surrogate father of this report ; secondly , as the draftsperson of the opinion ; and most importantly , as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship , employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights . #% Mr President , yesterday morning at the beginning of business - I was not here at the time - Mr Titley made reference to me and criticized me for my statement on the Titley report . #% Could you inform Commissioner Fischler 's cabinet that mobile phones are not allowed in this House . #% A constitution by its very nature requires and needs the endorsement of the people . #% It is a very , very poor example for the General to have undertaken . #% Likewise , this proposal that the Conference of Presidents acting by three-fifths majority , representing at least three groups , may propose to the plenary - acting by absolute majority - to terminate any elected office holder 's position within this Parliament . #% That is not happening . #% Finally , the Lisbon Strategy , which we voted on today , is a strategy for good governance , good economic growth and , above all , employment creation , which is the best tool for tackling poverty , social disadvantage and isolation . #% I do not expect it to run smoothly , but I think that , if we apply the lessons we have learnt , and if we insist on the proper statistics being established in the first place before the money is released , then we will achieve a successful enlargement and will be able to help the rural areas without the loss of too much taxpayers ' money . #% It is true that we had a very successful changeover programme but , more importantly , we have 4 % unemployment , less than half the EU average , and our economic growth is approaching 6 % , three times the EU average . #% Clearly the events of the Brussels summit of EU leaders last December are now well behind us . #% It is about time the doors of Bilderberg were opened and the public really knew what goes on , because most of the major players in the world today are all playing a part in Bilderberg . #% It is obvious to everyone now that many mistakes were made in the past . #% In Ireland we have about 2 million acres or 16 % of our agricultural land and our worse land at that . #% It is not yet clear what impact that will have on this nutritional health claims proposal . #% Hopefully , in the days ahead , we can redouble our political and diplomatic efforts in order to ensure the restoration of a balanced and fair competitive situation . #% I am pleased that steps are being taken by the Commissioner to follow up on the commitments already made , and look forward to the outcome of the meeting on 8 July . #% The regulations and directives enacted through the three decision-making procedures in Europe must be streamlined and simplified . #% To pick up on something Mr Haarder has already mentioned , our duty and responsibility is to the countries of eastern Europe , not because of the gift that we give them but because of the new enthusiasm and spirit that they can bring into what is becoming a stagnating European Union . #% Can we be assured that the legal sanctions against these crimes will operate openly and effectively ? #% And while we have a proposal here that the Commission will report back to us in five years ' time as to whether we are achieving what we set out to achieve , I hope that the Commission will come back here each year and tell us in what direction things are moving - whether the proposals are working , whether things are getting better or indeed in some cases getting worse - so that we can introduce corrective actions , rather than waiting for five years before beginning to take alternative steps . #% Most European countries are bad and some are appalling . #% Normally I do not engage in national politics , but today it is for a European reason that I want to state clearly for the record of the House that to vote `` yes '' to Nice in Ireland is to vote to remove the last formal obstacle to a significant enlargement . #% On the last occasion they insisted on dismantling agricultural support and then proceeded to provide support for United States farmers at a level three times greater than that received by European farmers . #% The EU should encourage reform strategies which involve domestic investors and devote particular attention to decentralised solutions involving small and medium-sized enterprises . #% There is something wrong somewhere , Mr President . #% It is not doing so and unless we take action to insist that they do , we will reap a terrible harvest in the future . #% I believe that the question of voting rights in this new agency should not be used as a subterfuge to allow the Commission to dominate proceedings . #% I know of your own personal commitment but actually you have not given me any clear indication of what the Commission is actually going to do in the UN conference which is taking place in a couple of weeks time . #% Secondly , the Israeli supreme court has actually ruled that force-feeding is illegal -- and that in a country where they had quite a large production of through force-feeding . #% As an Irish MEP , I am pleased to have the opportunity to thank the EU for its continuing support for peace and IFI funding . #% Mutual health organisations are not intended to take the place of the state ; rather , they offer an alternative , enabling the obstacles to health care access to be overcome and providing improved access to quality health care for all citizens regardless of their income . #% The whole question of what we do to protect marine life outside our waters is not a very popular issue . #% Stability arises from the fact that such expenditure has hitherto derived from legally binding assurances and we must continue to give these assurances . #% The visible projects that I see in my constituency , such as the computer training suite that I launched yesterday , is the human and proactive side of European Union policies . #% I will use my position as chair of the JPC to prevail upon the Icelandic people not to take up entrenched positions until such time as they know exactly what the deal is later on this year . #% Labelling is a clear and simple measure to promote energy efficiency , ethical production and development of greener technologies . #% Secondly , if greater efficiency is to be achieved by freeing up the movement of the beet quota , what are your intentions for the milk quota ? #% Go for it ! #% 
In many of our communities house break-ins , muggings and violent attacks are considered to be more commonplace than had been the case years ago . #% For this reason I have indicated on my group 's voting list a negative vote on certain paragraphs that duplicate points mentioned elsewhere in the report . #% When we understand that , we will treat each other and ourselves like the masterpiece that we are and we will realise our shared responsibility for each other 's safety . #% I have to say to the Commissioner : you have enough tools in the box at the moment with cross-compliance ; we do not need more . #% Banditry is rife in Baghdad and on all major transport routes leading to the capital . #% While I agree with the general procedures that are being laid down in the Tillich report , I disagree with some of the concepts that are creeping in . #% The European Union must ensure that these international commitments are fulfilled . #% I shall end with this short quote . #% This proposal is an intolerable interference with personal freedom of choice and liberty and typifies Brussels ' mindset of wishing to dictate every facet of our socio-economic life . #% Respect for human dignity is as important a right in any democracy as the right to freedom of expression . #% Would she , during her term of office between now and the end of the year , investigate what could be done for areas right around the Irish coast , including my own area in the west of Ireland , which once had prolific fishing grounds that have certainly not been plundered by our small inshore fleet ? #% The jury is out and we are gambling in advance of Cancun with the critical part of Europe 's economic policy , the CAP . #% I am therefore pleased that one of the important declarations at the Summit confirmed that there would be a safeguard clause on food safety included in each of the accession treaties . #% A British Labour MP , Ms Clwyd , received a letter from the Department of Trade and Industry acknowledging that there were 59 arms exports licences being considered by the British Government . #% Paedophilia on the Internet must be prosecuted . #% We must make sure that our response is common and not isolated , shared and not unilateral , aimed at our common enemy , which is terrorism , but not at wider forces such as Islam or the wider Arab world , should that be the source whence this monster may have sprung . #% As regards the issue of waste water from slaughter houses , I believe that this must be reviewed as it covers a huge quantity of material for disposal . #% It is very important for me to state here today , particularly as an Irish European , that whatever the complex set of motives and reasons behind it , the `` no '' to Nice did not signify a `` no '' to enlargement . #% I welcome the Commission 's initiative in proposing ways to boost our tourist industry , which is an industry able to make a major contribution to local , regional and national economies . #% Firstly I would like to welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in Parliament . #% The question is in relation to flags of convenience . #% Mr President , I must say that I can not help being somewhat bemused by the suggestion from Mr Giansily about what Mr Giscard d'Estaing would like . #% We would like to especially thank the EU for its quiet and unintrusive role in Northern Ireland , the framework of the European Union which helped Irish and British Ministers to work together the common agricultural policy , the common policies that created the single market where the people North and South cooperate together now without any border to prevent them from growing together and cooperating and trading together . #% I give these examples to highlight the fact that just because a directive has been agreed it does not mean it has been implemented . #% Mr President , it is now clear that everyone 's hope that the foot-and-mouth disease crisis will be temporary and short-lived has not been realised . #% There are also other matters , like agriculture and fisheries , to deal with . #% We all know that the enlargement process can not take place unless there is some reform in the decision-making procedures within the European Union itself . #% Therefore , the report calls on the Commission to present , as soon as possible , a detailed communication on children 's rights , linking the issue with EU development policy . #% It is a pity Mrs Mouskouri could not have sung her report today . #% The Chinese have the advantage of cheap labour and sometimes , by our standards , questionable labour standards . #% Mr President , I really am very upset that in the Intergovernmental Conference , we have what I would regard as a lamentable failure of political leadership - a retreat into national chauvinism - at a time when we need a democratic , effective , power-sharing Europe . #% It is time for this Parliament to stand by the victims of failed regulatory mechanisms and to insist that an equitable settlement be finalised for the policyholders of Equitable Life . #% The bottom line is simply this : I believe that the Union and the USA should work together to preserve our common interests , to minimise our collective differences , to maximise our own influence for good in the world . #% In the ten years that I have been an MEP I have never encountered such a personal , aggressive and abusive campaign as I have with this particular directive . #% If today 's debate , Mr President-in-Office , can underline any message , the message is : take the courage and conviction from here that the rules must be changed . #% The Commissioner has solidly justified the expenditure in relation to the Berlaymont . #% Studies in my country have established a statistically robust cause-effect link between eutrophication , or algal bloom , which has an enormous detrimental effect on water quality and aquatic ecosystems , and phosphorous concentration . #% It is against Amendments Nos 4 , 5 and 8 for legal reasons . #% As it is not a ban , we should be able to vote on it . #% The UK initiative and the Severn Estuary strategy , involving 12 local authorities , have only secured funding for the next six months . #% The Youth for Europe programme has been very successful in encouraging more exchanges between students . #% At the same time , we must be true to our values in relation to respect for human rights and try to get the balance right . #% Mr President , on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland , who have known the cruelties of terrorism for more than a generation , I wish to convey my heartfelt sympathy to the parents and people of Beslan . #% This is also a feature of the Irish rules and on the larger ships it is quite usual for a veterinarian to travel on board to supervise the stock . #% At the outset I want to congratulate and thank Madam Hermange for her advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities and in particular for her willingness to take on board new ideas with regard to creating a barrier-free Europe . #% Other alternatives can be looked at and a special fund set up to keep us up to speed with what is happening in America in that regard . #% There was a hysterical press interest , not in what was happening in the discussions , but in what was happening on the streets , which was largely due to complete clumsiness by the local police . #% For an organisation to tolerate this , such a publicly known problem , shows it needs reform . #% As far as environmental protection is concerned , let me highlight intelligent energy , for which I am the rapporteur in this Parliament . #% On a very excluding special needs education system ? #% Much of the resolution is devoted , as other speakers have said , to Mr Wang Dan 's case . #% Third , in the area of security and defence , it is important that no new obligations are imposed on Ireland which threaten our traditional policy of military neutrality . #% Before this ban is lifted again , Commissioner , I would like your assurance that you will do everything to ensure that our veterinary inspection in the Far East where the outbreaks took place is of the highest quality , and we accept no excuses . #% Abortion rates in Ireland were referred to . #% Striking a blow against transit fraud would also represent a positive step against organized crime , which is one of the greatest problems facing the European Union . #% I could have flown to America and back in the same time ! #% The people we meet on the streets every day are not afraid of Europe or of the European Union . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome , very warmly , the report by my colleague , Thomas Mann , because it looks to the future and that is what we are talking about . #% Mr President , relocation of industry to cheaper wage economies leaves in its wake economic and social hardship which divides rather than unites the regions of Europe . #% So I ask myself : do we really need to go the wall about a political issue like this ? #% My call in this House is that across Europe , under the aegis of each nation-state , organised crime should be relentlessly pursued . #% In other words , if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions . #% Would you now take steps to bar all air transport of radioactive material until the new IAEA guidelines can be urgently revised to incorporate the International Civil Aviation Organization 's own guidelines and requirements , because so far they have not taken them into consideration ? #% My fear is that this will just be a self-fulfilling prophesy . #% We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life . #% It was the first such meeting since the European Parliament ratified the new College of European Commissioners and the new President , Romano Prodi , has stated many times that he is deeply committed to involving Parliament in more decision-making in the future . #% 
Thirdly , the techniques , costs , etc. and financing of decommissioning . #% Clearly the British Government is using Ireland as a scapegoat for its failure to address the genuine problems of its own farmers . #% Mr President , this first reading on the budget is a defining moment but , as we know , it is not yet the definitive moment in identifying and setting our priorities for 1997 . #% Can we do anything in a positive way at this particular time nine years later ? #% Of all the groups , none are currently in threat of their lives simply because they belong to that grouping -- except the disabled . #% In fact , I believe that the European Union , together with the United Nations , should continue to work to build peace and reconciliation on the island of Cyprus . #% It is a piecemeal approach in which the emphasis varies according to the publication . #% Ireland must be prepared to play a constructive and positive role within the framework of the European Union to assist in solving the crisis in Kosovo and in guaranteeing that Slobodan Milosevic does not achieve his aim of bringing about the genocide of the native Albanians in Kosovo . #% Medicated feed or feed containing pre-mixed antibiotic additives have one very definitive purpose on large units : to treat sick animals . #% Therefore the three amendments tabled are not necessary and I would ask colleagues not to support them . #% Although many people have expressed their disgust , I do not know how we are going to go back to the electorate and justify that basically things are remaining the same . #% I refer in this case to the transnational abduction of children by their parents and also the increasing problem of transnational abduction of children by criminal means . #% I go back to the example of toys . #% Some people dismiss this as an issue but I think it is very important . #% This is a wise approach by the Committee on Agriculture . #% In the past , and in particular in the north-west of the Community , there has been deep suspicion in the fishing industry about how fishing policy was conducted and managed and a deep lack of trust . #% The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is in the interest of all States worldwide , and the European Union is correct to restate its deep commitment to bringing the treaty into force at the earliest opportunity possible . #% Finally , I would like to say that not only fishermen are going to suffer but also their wives and families will suffer and death is going to come to the fishing villages and to the hopes of the future for these people . #% Would you agree that many of the host countries need a policy of integrating workers from new Member States , to be fair to their needs , and that we need to allow migrant workers with qualifications to progress in the careers for which they are qualified in the host Member States ? #% But I would also say that I very much appreciate that when Mr Tung came to visit the European Union , his first stop was the European Parliament . #% We must reach a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen , and for that , we need from our European leaders real political courage and less of the waffle . #% We must also enhance cooperation and communication channels between organisation and stakeholders concerned . #% I hope that , at the Council meeting tomorrow , the leaders , the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission will deal with that issue most urgently . #% We need scientists in order to have research and development . #% At this hour of the night there is no point in underlining yet again how important a job the Stockholm Convention has to do . #% In this way we can only add to the democratic legitimacy of the reform process . #% For those reasons I am obliged to say that I can not support this report , although I readily acknowledge the genuine motivations the rapporteur had in bringing it forward . #% Those working in public enterprises are the concern of many colleagues here . #% On the MAGP , everybody admits that the EU fishing fleets are too large . #% Irish industry is currently paying a levy to Repak to meet commitments that are not being met . #% Mr President , I very much welcome this report on the transportation of radioactive material within the European Union . #% I support the provisions of Article 16 wholeheartedly ... #% I am not afraid to be dismissed as a merchant of doom when I hold a view borne out by hard scientific data , compiled in an independent study on behalf of the Irish Government . #% We need to do all we can with the competence we have . #% Firstly , I should like put on the record of this House that the Treaty of Nice needs to be adopted by all existing Member States of the European Union to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union by ten countries , which we hope to see in the not too distant future . #% It is unfortunate that the European Parliament is being forced to divide on such a fundamentally important issue for Spain . #% It has been a very difficult task and , excuse the pun , a difficult road for him to travel down . #% The movement of this dangerous cargo at this time is spitting in the face of the victims of September 11 . #% I also think it is rather bizarre that last week the DTI produced a press release celebrating the massive amount of funding they would be getting from Objective 2 - a bumper share of funds - when in fact they seem incapable of spending it . #% When we look at the increase in the numbers of people who are over 55 years of age in the European Union there is a social necessity to ensure them ease of access to telecommunication networks at very low cost , sometimes at no cost at all . #% Furthermore , there is no basis for such a proposal if we are really concerned with the welfare of the animals involved . #% We hope that will not be the case and that the Police Service of Northern Ireland will bring a trial successfully to court , with the cooperation of those who have influence within communities in Northern Ireland . #% An effective evaluation of the measures we put into place is essential . #% The mid-term review brought us many changes , and we are about to embark on even more . #% Of course they need one or two things done to them , but if we constantly complain , we will get nowhere . #% The Fianna Fail MEPs reluctantly voted in favour of this proposal . #% I would like to highlight certain amendments for support : Amendment No 11 which clarifies that certificates issued before the directive enters into force would remain valid ; Amendment No 21 which provides that only countries complying with the STCW Convention should receive recognition and Amendment No 22 , which proposes a definitive period for Member States to implement these proposals . #% It is ironic , that the people in this House who argued against Nice , because Nice was too much Europe , are now saying that Europe should instruct its Member States not to ratify Nice . #% It is really important that we deal with this issue because of the increasing popularity of homeopathic products in particular and of natural and alternative medicine in general . #% The underlying cause for a large proportion of these crimes is drug dependency and the abuse of illegal drugs . #% It allows us to have links with third countries such as the United States - why not - and also Russia and countries further afield such as South Africa and some of the applicant countries . #% We conducted hearings on how these funds work . #% Amendments Nos 32 and 36 concerning antibiotics have to be rejected . #% I regret that the overall impact of the crisis on consumers and farmers is not improving . #% Greater involvement of the ACP national parliaments and civil society - through financial and technical support - is needed in order to enhance the ACP-EU cooperation . #% They have the responsibility and the duty to jump together . #% It is not enough to agree on a set of rules . #% I would like to ask the Commission specifically to state what action , if any , is envisaged for research under the Fifth Framework Programme to fight Alzheimer 's disease . #% Who does this informing apart from France and the UK ? #% The approval of the Irish application for aid under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will contribute to the re-training and up-skilling of the workers in question . #% The points that they touch on are very important . #% Whether it is his bulk carrier or the speedboat version that is commended by Mr Elles , I certainly think that the Commissioner 's focus on deepening the relationship and on being more strategic - even if there is argument on detail - is , in broad terms very welcome . #% These questions and practices have not arisen so far in the Union and certainly what Mr McCartin has said here today is something that I would very much identify with and support . #% Let us learn and apply that lesson . #% As a German Member of Parliament told me : `` Professor Raftery is right , but there is a wave of hysteria in Germany so I must vote against him '' . #% Their own government has crucified them by refusing to allow them into the single currency . #% 
If the Court of Auditors can not control this sort of leakage , well who can we expect to control anything in the European Union ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , we all understand the concerns of many of the other sectors within agriculture , and they almost certainly thought that we were placing far too much emphasis on trying to resolve the problems facing the dairy sector . #% However , to target the creation of jobs for others , particularly in a region like Dundalk , which needs economic stability to copperfasten the process of peace and reconciliation , is unacceptable . #% Would you not accept that we need an adequate response mechanism and that the only way to address the problem would be to establish an EU coastguard ? #% in writing . - Planning for the 2011 budget is very important and I agree with the report 's call for a carefully considered and transparent discussion . #% Madam President , last Friday I went to a neighbourhood in my constituency where up to 80 % of the households are in receipt of some form of welfare payment . #% It is a terribly important area but in the new ACP-EU partnership agreement there is a special reference to the tackling of corruption . #% In the resolution , reference is made to two very old Buddhist monks who spent two decades in detention under house arrest for their peaceful support for human rights , democracy and religious freedom . #% We must commit to giving our utmost support , financial and otherwise , to achieve this . #% Just last month , Commissioner Lamy proposed a pragmatic solution which , in his view , is workable , sustainable and legally secure , because it complies with both the Doha mandate and the compromise text of 16 December 2002 that was discussed within the WTO . #% That response includes a number of specific actions that the Fund is taking to address matters raised in the report . #% In my final few seconds , let me talk about the committee itself and the procedures under which we work . #% I am particularly concerned here as a woman and a public representative of a small country that up to 30 years ago had prohibitions on women 's rights in many areas ; women were not even allowed to work once they got married . #% Out of the 4500 people I met last week in Ireland , 3000 of them brought up issues of European concern that they wanted to see solved . #% We have a responsibility to ensure that multinational firms are unable to transport their damage and their behaviour to the developing world because of restrictions that we may place upon them within the European Union . #% The rejection of the Verts/ALE amendment requiring that Member States reach such an agreement means that the report , which is serious and important , is fundamentally flawed . #% We need openness and to know what is going on . #% I support the Commission 's proposal that the amount of the minimum sum insured in the case of the personal injuries arising from an accident should be unlimited . #% Mr President , the two reports which have been discussed here this morning should set alarm bells ringing for most European citizens . #% It can not be right , after 11 September , to continue to stockpile and increase the stockpile of hundreds of tonnes of plutonium . #% We need accurate information across all 25 Member States , collected in a uniform way , so that we have good-quality , reliable and relevant information to underpin all policy decisions . #% It is my view that the current crisis in the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is such that the European Union has to exert the greatest possible pressure on the Israeli Government . #% It is my hope that the most dramatic reform since the CAP was first introduced will lead to greater stability and provide a much-needed stimulus for young people to take up farming as a full-time career . #% Where will the next nuclear disaster be ? #% I think it should happen , it must happen , and the Commission has a role here as well in insisting that it does happen . #% In particular , the possibility of using 20 % modulation in the CAP to fund rural development without having to meet the agreed rules on co-financing and spending guidelines is regrettable and could lead to a distortion of competition between Member States . #% It is clearly explained in the recitals to the regulation that the main aim is to contribute to global warming reduction targets . #% Either the Nitrates Directive should be repealed or compliance with one should remove the other from the equation . #% I am concerned that this agreement in its current unamended form will allow European boats ( including Irish boats ) to fish in the waters of Western Sahara , a territory illegally occupied by Morocco . #% Taoiseach , you have proven your skills as a negotiator , as somebody who understands the difficulties each country faces , particularly when discussing the Constitution . #% Instead of accepting compromises for the sake of political expediency , we should send this Monday morning directive back for redrafting under the better regulation initiative . #% We too must prevent further terrorist attacks , and this can only be achieved if the international community continues to work closely together . #% There are other actuarial methods and accounting methods for dealing with pension contributions , health questions and so on . #% We need from you communication of a vision and clarity of ideas , but they have to be acceptable ideas . #% It now emerges that Member States who opt for this voluntary modulation can spend the money in any way they choose , without regard to the rules or indeed national cofinancing ; this is regrettable . #% But we all know in this Parliament that any kind of subsidy , whether it is structural funds or state subsidy funds , can not last indefinitely in the near future . #% However , with Spanish Members so deeply divided on the resolution before us , it has made it impossible for the rest of Parliament to form a united view on a subject that we really should not be divided on . #% I would urge them to read this report ; to analyse in detail the Commission scoreboard , and when they clearly see that the single market is still a very long way from being completed , especially in the field of tax harmonisation , they might change their minds , especially in the wake of the decision at the Vienna Summit to carry out an impact study into the effects of abolition . #% What has the effect of liberalisation and privatisation been on those who are marginalised ? #% Of course , it is not the poor in general who carry out the acts but those responsible for the acts are often poor . #% It would not succeed without other mainstream transport infrastructure projects such as the major C ring road , the Dublin port tunnel and the upgrading of the main roads out of the city . #% the secular nature of the state and its institutions #% I have visited housing estates where grandmothers are rearing grandchildren because the parents have died , not from an overdose of cannabis or even of heroin , but because they used dirty needles to inject themselves with heroin or took impure heroin . #% His proposals for reform were complemented by an equally thoughtful response from Parliament 's Agriculture Committee and I join the previous speaker in complimenting the Chairman of our committee . #% Taking out a mortgage to buy a house is usually the largest and most expensive personal financial commitment entered into by most people . #% I believe that the five-week period for the changeover is of the correct duration . #% It seems to me that equating that with a loss of EUR 14 million is a gross exaggeration . #% I speak here today as somebody who voted against the customs union with Turkey last year because I did not believe the line that I was being given . #% SOLVIT is a means of righting these wrongs and assisting national administrations in ensuring the correct implementation and transposition of the legislation that we pass together in the European Union . #% I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service . #% Education , health , transport and other frontline services have all seen their funding slashed across the EU . #% My country , Ireland , has seen a very welcome reversal in its economic fortunes over the past five years but even our `` Celtic Tiger ' suffers from the cancer of unemployment . #% Madam President , Commissioner , I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the production of this report . #% That STOA study made it absolutely clear that this is something the European Union should tackle . #% EU leaders in Portugal last year laid down a framework of proposals whereby training in the use of the Internet would be extended to all primary and secondary schools across the European Union . #% The EU has a role to play in promoting best management practice that suits the needs of local actors and communities , and in incentivising forestation efforts compatible with local conditions and native species . #% My last point , which is not often mentioned and which is not paid due recognition , is flexibility - the ability to adapt to changing circumstances . #% Therefore , it is fully deserving of support from the Commission and a budget line should be set up to promote the tourism sector . #% Do you feel that the mood amongst developing countries is such that we risk causing great disruption to the discussions if we insist , against their will , on pursuing the question of investment ? #% I support the proposal for a directive on the conditions required for the crews of vessels providing regular passenger and freight ferry services between Member States . #% The long term EU budget should also follow the agreed so-called EU 2020 strategic objectives , especially our internationally binding climate objectives . #% Around 20 % of production could be saved simply by using energy-saving windows . #% In relation to the proposal mentioned by several speakers , this UK - , US - and Spanish-backed proposal for a UN resolution would put the administration of Iraq , including decisions on its oil reserves , into the hands of the invaders and occupying forces . #% The sense of consensus is to be welcomed . #% I do not know what kind of a message that will send to people in Ireland . #% Mr President , I beg permission to raise a matter concerning human rights . #% 
The propaganda we have heard , which is completely simplistic and totally inaccurate , does nothing to help the debate , wastes the money of those who are trying to promote the opposite approach , and will not work . #% There is a real need for the other states in the region to maximise the pressure for her immediate release and to ensure that free elections concur with that . #% To date the European Union has given ECU 150 million , as people have said , and has involved itself with more than 3 , 000 projects . #% Robert McCartney 's sisters continue their quest for justice and we must support them here in this House where we can . #% The main reason for that is that they do not have access to more long-term finance than just a one-year term loan . #% The Council 's common position has taken on board the majority of Parliament 's amendments from first reading , but there remain differences mainly concerning the following points . #% Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts , to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements . #% It is not easy to discern the myriad of concerns , some domestic , some European , which gave rise to the `` no '' result in Ireland . #% Socrates phase one has been a very worthwhile experiment in transnational education . #% So the Moscow mechanism is not an exclusive one and , on balance , it would appear that sending such a delegation without the cooperation of the recipient state would not be advantageous on this occasion . #% However , it is not too late : Austria and Ireland have led the way where others must follow . #% This Sellafield nuclear plant has achieved nothing , except to heap environmental misery on us all . #% Nevertheless , we look forward to a proposal from the Commission on the subject , which is of great importance . #% We attach considerable importance to the successful introduction of the euro . #% In such an event the possibility of so many people being marooned is alarming . #% There is plenty of money to resolve the problem for the next two years and following that we can still have that 1.27 % which I hope will finance enlargement . #% Mr President , I shall be brief . #% We have had an interesting debate in producing this report in committee . #% Because in Ireland there is no regional authority with real decision-making powers . #% This is a well-focused report with concrete suggestions . #% This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria . #% The UK does not operate a system of levies and we do not want to see it introduced through the back door . #% We would like to keep Europol 's remit and scope small and specific and thereby make the agency as efficient and effective as possible . #% That is not to say that the Irish people do not have clear concerns which they want addressed before any further referendum on the Treaty of Nice . #% You will see in this resolution that we call , for example , for a dedicated unit in the Commission looking at children 's rights , looking at legislation so that we can assess its impact on the children and also on the lives of their families . #% It seems incredible but it is true , that in Ireland , where agriculture has long been one of the economic bases of the country , farmers are now beginning to wonder whether their sons or daughters will be able to carry on the family tradition . #% As the Commission points out , the proposed joint action does not seek to introduce a new right to seek temporary protection in addition to the existing right to seek asylum . #% Any further delay would rightly be regarded as political . #% There is a need to address that issue . #% We have achieved our 2001 target of recycling 25 % of packaging and we are well on our way to achieving the 2005 target of a 50 % recycling rate thanks to proper , sensible timelines and derogations . #% All of these agreements have human rights clauses . #% Apart from the obvious benefit of bio-ethanol as an alternative energy source and its potential contribution to a cleaner environment , some of the by-products produced would also be of value to the fertiliser and animal feed sectors . #% We have to consider the ethics of promising one thing and doing something different . #% Mr Trichet , only a few weeks ago you called upon European consumers to open up their purses and spend more , but there is not enough certainty in the current economic climate to facilitate the surge in spending that you call for . #% I am presently dealing with a case in Ireland where someone who has trained as a physiotherapist in one Member State can not get their qualification recognised in Ireland because of the formal academic aspect even though in every other country in the European Union work experience is recognised as the equivalent of the academic qualifications . #% I particularly support the Amendment calling for : the phasing-out by 2010 of all forms of export competition , including food aid , export subsidies and state-trading entities , by all industrialised countries in parallel . #% I would like to express my support for the concept of including a new special section for the engineering profession , as introduced by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% However , Turkey still has a long way to go . #% That is something we should note at this stage because full democratic participation is vital . #% The aim of concluding the enlargement negotiations with the more advanced countries by the end of 2002 is an achievable objective . #% There is a huge threat now to cultural diversity within the European Union because of the import of programmes from America and globalisation even of food chains like McDonalds . #% The Commission proposal to allow up to 5 % vegetable fat in the manufacture of chocolate is acceptable , as is the decision of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection to allow the listing of vegetable fats with other ingredients . #% I am hopeful that the ten applicant countries will be in a position to fully join the European Union on May 1st 2004 next . #% We have to recognise that there is a sort of mutual misunderstanding in fishing ports throughout the European Union . #% The recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan demonstrated once again that the EU 's disaster-response capability needs to be greatly enhanced . #% It is up to the British government to make a statement on these matters . #% So I ask the Commissioner to bear those comments in mind in particular in the days and weeks ahead . #% Companies need to understand that late payment is not good credit management . #% I would like to have had more certainty about the proposed role of the Court of Justice taking into account the role of the courts of the Member States . #% This means maintaining at the very least the measure currently outlined in the chairman 's draft text . #% In summary , colleagues , as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism I recognise the desirability of developing a single market in rail-service provision and the potential benefits for the consumer . #% I thank the Commissioner for his answer . #% So I want to ask you if you agree that some measures need to be put in place for SMEs which will require refinancing , and what role the Commission could play . #% He would have been leading for the PSE Group in this debate otherwise . #% During the past week , on business in the inner city in my constituency , I witnessed whole complexes riven by drugs . #% For my country , Ireland , food exports and in particular beef are of paramount importance to our economy and the income of farmers . #% When I have tried to put an oral question in this Parliament or in the last one , the Commissioners have basically been afraid to answer . #% We need to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy while , at the same time , providing total traceability with regard to livestock movement as well as safeguarding public health . #% This should not just be a business trip that he is engaged in now ; business development and human rights must go hand in hand . #% The key to this debate is balance . #% The EU Enforcement Group , which has been set up under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 338/97 , needs to be revisited somewhat urgently . #% I agree with the observations of colleagues about fears of a drift in certain cases towards unilateralism , some of the points about bilateral versus multilateral trade and issues about Kyoto , the Echelon Committee , the death penalty , and so on . #% On-going hostilities and human rights abuses must halt . #% The actions of the Israeli Government that deny the Palestinians their human rights are in breach of that Association Agreement . #% This new development must be stopped and the proceeds of their crimes tracked down and confiscated . #% Contradictory approaches are almost impossible to explain to the non-initiated general public , and , in my opinion , completely undermine our collective credibility . #% 
However , I could not take on board the second part because to me it would be an undue interference in the internal affairs of the Maltese people . #% Let us become the voices of a new world . #% Further , and more specifically , I welcome the amendments regarding the inclusion of alternative medicine in the programme . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome and endorse my colleague , Mr Linkohr 's report , particularly his comments on the involvement of Parliament and on the evolution of European Union democratic structures . #% I accept everything he has said and I understand the reasons why he said what he said . #% The move to use road tax to effectively promote energy-efficient cars by charging significantly more tax for cars with bigger engines that use more fuel will mean that drivers will have to pay more for bigger and more powerful cars . #% I think we should all get a clap on the back . #% FIFA has stated that there is a deplorable trend in the increased level of racist attacks in Europe . #% Severe restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of information persist . #% I believe that his kind of experience is vital and that we need some kind of audacious political gesture very quickly if we are not to see the whole thing fall down around our ears . #% There is a strong correlation between research effort and economic success , and the European Union at least is giving an example and showing that it understands that connection . #% The ECR Group therefore voted in favour of this report . #% The new paradigm must also necessarily be people-based , reflecting the concept of lifelong learning , investing in adaptability through education and training and investing in self-development and individual opportunity . #% It aspires to improving a situation that is indeed common . #% In my opinion , we need to adopt a two-fold approach in order to attempt to mitigate the effects of depressed prices on our farmers . #% I fully endorse the proposal that depictions of persons under the age of 18 involved in sexually explicit conduct constitute the sexual exploitation of children . #% They should mean something and there should be consequences if they are repeatedly breached . #% Within each Member State , effective ` unbundling ' of network and supply activities in gas and electricity must be made a reality : in Ireland this has yet to happen . #% However , we must double our efforts to find an alternative to DDT because huge damage is being done to humans -- it is biocumulative -- and to our environment by our need to look after the children who are here today . #% They sent us this memorandum asking our support for action to solve their problem and to have justice . #% He will do everything in his power to ensure that something of interest to all Europeans gets through an appropriate Council . #% We want to exercise our right . #% Ireland , for example , adopted the ` Equal Status Act ' in 2000 , and our legislation outlaws direct and indirect discrimination , including discrimination on grounds of gender , marital status and family status . #% It is turned into dioxins and also toxic ash - what will you do with that ? #% On the other hand , removal of the derogation would impose unnecessary administrative burdens and costs in these Member States without bringing any visible benefits to anyone concerned . #% I can not accept the promotion of equal matrimonial and other rights for same sex couples . #% My thanks to Mr Patijn for his answer . #% It is something I advocate . #% Additional restrictions on existing LCP are not justified in the context of Member State commitments under the NEC directive to reduce overall emissions and the impending application of the IPPC directive . #% The compromise is that both Parliament and the Council have agreed on a qualified health professional . #% Please , in all of this , do not ask the poorest people in the world to carry a burden they are not able to carry . #% Farming is one of the oldest , most basic and most essential activities . #% We will only succeed , however , if we are committed in the short term to supporting the European model based on family farming . #% The UN Special Envoy for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa is to visit six drought-stricken countries in the region from 6 to 16 September , and I understand that representatives of WHO , the UN Children 's Fund and the Food and Agricultural Organisation are expected to join the mission . #% I can assure you that the Quaestors are working on it . #% Unfortunately we have to make this a criminal offence because of the frequent reluctance of people to obey court orders where children and the custody of children are concerned . #% If we believe an exercise will work , we will pursue that exercise . #% It is either a single market or it is not . #% All these aspects will come to the fore even more in the coming years through the recently-reformed common agricultural policy . #% There is a good home rating scheme developed in my own constituency which should be far more widespread . #% Madam President , obviously in this House we are parliamentarians and democrats . #% On south-eastern Europe , I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements . #% There is a particular need to ensure that people under 18 years of age may only have implants as a medical necessity , and their guardians should also be fully informed of the implications of such operations . #% The organization now has a permanent Council which meets on a weekly basis and which now provides the opportunity for all OSCE issues to be addressed . #% More encouragement should be given to farming families to develop small and medium-sized enterprises on their holdings . #% But an even greater marvel is that he has three such great , large , heavy hats and only one head to wear them on . #% This has to stop . #% EU studies have shown that one woman in five has suffered violence at the hands of her male partner , and that 25 % of all violent crime reported in Europe involves a man assaulting his wife or partner . #% I , and those people I represent , support a united democratic Europe and enlargement . #% In conclusion , it is essential that whatever regulation we adopt aims at an exemplary level of safety in sea transport and the prevention of pollution in our seas . #% In particular , the guidelines need to be simplified and reduced . #% That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today . #% It is unacceptable in any state of the Union that an organization should impose sectarian intimidation of citizens . #% I hope very much that we will recognize that significant medical achievements can be achieved through biotechnology . #% That amendment genuinely sought to address many of the fears that Members had expressed as deficiencies in the Council 's response . #% I caution against reform of sheepmeat at the expense of other sectors , particularly beef . #% Finally , I urge you , as Prime Minister , to continue to take a firm stand in defence of the justified rebate , which you can properly defend on its own merits ... #% The whole concept is an actual farce because the results of these ` peaceful ' explosions can easily be used to develop weapons of war . #% I want to say how thankful the Members are for this . #% Furthermore , trading insults across the Atlantic serves no purpose , and only makes matters worse . #% I would like to ask the Commission whether the UK 's action is in breach of Article 19 ( 3 ) of the waste shipment regulation and Article 4 of the waste framework directive . #% But we have said very clearly that free movement of goods must not compromise safety . #% The whole drugs issue in Europe and the way people deal with it is very disturbing . #% Does that invitation extend to Turkey ? #% When you are up there you seem to just look at the front and the centre . #% To go back to a point that the Union for Europe Group made about the additive to cider , I am from Ireland and I am not in favour of this additive . #% 
Where there is increased market access we must be sensitive to some products ; if the markets are to be destabilised we have to bring in mechanisms to control that destabilisation . #% From my work in rural development and the number of new jobs created in programmes like LEADER and other Community-based enterprise schemes , I am of the opinion that in the past we have ignored the potential of our human resources , our people , to play a meaningful role in the generation of wealth . #% It is essential that beef farmers are shown the maximum consideration . #% We stand today at a new frontier , the dawn of a new era , when the old visions of Europe have been broken down , when countries that were denied the opportunities to have democracy and representation are being given that opportunity now . #% At present , the arbitrary cut-off point of 75 % of GDP does not take account of important factors such as unemployment and peripherality . #% The rational choice is to stop the profligate use of petrol and diesel and to change the behaviour of the public and of those involved in transport . #% Would the powers that be send the message , so there is no misunderstanding : tomorrow we would like them present . #% This period has afforded us sufficient opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the directive in contributing to a genuine single market for motor insurance . #% The most recent came in 1968-69 , and the most deadly in 1918-19 : the so-called Spanish flu pandemic . #% They include insecticides such as DDT -- perhaps the best-known POP -- industrial chemicals such as PCBs and indeed the unintentional by-products of industrial processes such as dioxins and furans . #% Mr President , I welcome Mr Blair and thank him for staying for the entire debate here this morning . #% With regard to China , the strike hard campaign continues to be extremely worrying , having dramatically increased the number of executions in China , often carried out in reliance on insufficient evidence in summary trials . #% A properly resourced European Maritime Safety Agency would enable such coordination with due respect for the need to safeguard the subsidiarity principle in recognition that primary responsibility must lie with coastal Member States . #% That is a depressing answer , Commissioner , so I hope very much that , in the provision of services directive you are proposing , you will recognise that this is an important issue , and above all that in these situations we are very often discussing a deeply human tragedy . #% An in-depth inquiry is needed to answer all these questions ; after all we are dealing with investors who , if catastrophe strikes , have to pay and pay to the point where they can lose their businesses and their homes . #% I believe that more progress can still be made . #% This relates to the facility that MEPs have to sign on a register on a Friday so that they are enabled to claim their allowances for accommodation on a Thursday night when they participate in votes on a Thursday afternoon and are unable to fly home . #% I firmly believe that the Irish Government is in breach of European Union standards in relation to transparency in complying with humanitarian law , and the minimum standards that we have set down . #% I would reiterate the appeal by a previous speaker for the setting up of a competent , independent , scientific body to act as a watchdog and to communicate with the public at an early stage , especially through consumer associations . #% Our minister , who was crying over what had happened at the weekend and saying that it was one of his worst fears , did not think this meeting was important enough to attend . #% Now they are deciding because they do not like the politics of a specific Member of this Parliament that they are going to refuse entry . #% In any event , the basic structures of the Union , which existed at the time individual countries joined the Union and which enjoyed the support of the majority of our electorate at that time , should be preserved as far as possible . #% The last point I want to address is the failure of the Court of Auditors to give a statement of assurance . #% I do not believe that the extension of qualified majority voting to taxation matters at European Council level is a particularly welcome development . #% ISPAT in Cork , Ireland , which was formerly a state company , was bought over some years ago by a private company and is now in liquidation . #% The very name ` Irish Box ' I accept is emotive , but this is an issue in which we must have equity . #% It is a fairly trivial matter in one way and it seems that he has gone to extreme measures in his dealings with the people in Pakistan , with the judiciary in Pakistan , in the way he has dealt with it , which is extremely dangerous . #% However , Member States should not be allowed to become complacent in the implementation of these 42 directives . #% That is the way to look at peace , security and justice for all . #% These are serious issues . #% We have had freedom of movement for the Irish soccer team as regards Britain for a long number of years now . #% In contrast , I should mention Japan and Taiwan , who have recognised the extent to which their longline industries use flags of convenience and they have taken corrective measures by launching programmes to repatriate or to scrap a large number of tuna longliners . #% Mr President , this is a useful and very necessary procedure . #% But , if for no other reason than economic growth and a viable future for Europe , we should rethink our attitude to the sanctity of life , to the position of the family and to support for mothers and other carers . #% The nationalities of Europe are not changed , they are the creation of God . #% Cutthroat competition in the air seems to be leading to a lowering of safety standards and we have seen a lot of accidents recently which I know will be investigated and we will see what turns up . #% Staging posts allow animals to be unloaded , watered and rested , and also the essential cleaning and rebedding of trucks . #% I will be supportive of any such proposals which come before this Parliament . #% France and Holland emphatically rejected the Constitution , so we slapped a gagging order on the countries which it was feared might also say ` No ' . #% Mesh sizes for fixed gears must be harmonised . #% That is why we supported the Gallagher report . #% For these and other reasons I felt it inappropriate to participate in the vote . #% I too would like to welcome the fact that you have come to this House to dialogue with us before you go to your summit meeting . #% But behind the reluctance of police forces to implement court orders on the custody of children in one country when they are abducted into another Member State , very often lies the potential for great tragedy . #% Israeli and Palestinian authorities are going to have to move to renew some level of security cooperation with the aim of ending this awful present cycle of violence . #% If it were not for his efforts in enabling ECU 100 million to be put on the line from the reserve through the supplementary budget , we would not have had the impetus for this tiny success . #% The directive will apply to accidents involving nationals of a Member State of the Union on Union territory or in any third country operating the Green Card system . #% That is why we have asked for national plans with clear targets that will guarantee the return of the investment . #% The beef regime unwittingly also supports this exodus from sheep production as ewes are counted for extensification payment under this regime but are not paid for , thereby encouraging farmers who have the option to decrease their sheep and increase their cattle on a holding to draw down more extensification payments . '' #% The attitude of the US in the post-war situation will provide the key as to whether or not we can achieve any or all of these . #% We must favour creating a proper business environment where employment can be created , and where proper and real jobs can be maintained within the European Union . #% That must not continue . #% The research is quite alarming and I hope that colleagues who like to smoke will respect the health of everybody else by refraining from doing so within Parliament , except in the very limited areas where smoking is permitted . #% Mr President , I welcome Mr Duff 's report . #% The Committee on Institutional Affairs ' report contains many elements with which I am in total agreement . #% The Greens were in a difficult position in trying not to amend it because we knew what the end result would be . #% This is an inadequate structure in a Community of over 25 Member States . #% Comrades and colleagues in this Parliament , we need public support for the European Union . #% The Council represents the interests of the 15 Member State governments within the institutional framework of the Union and currently , under existing EU Treaties , unanimous agreement of the 15 Member States is required for any tax changes sought within the Union . #% I know it is very complicated and difficult , but very rarely do we hear any details of what is happening on the ground in these parts of the world and how we are tackling the serious problem of children with HIV and AIDS . #% Tattoos , however , are much less satisfactory . #% I note that the President-in-Office has referred to the discussions which she hopes will come to a fruitful and successful conclusion . #% Such measures , Mr Trichet , will assist in creating economic stability , environmental sustainability and consumer confidence . #% The common agricultural policy gets a lot of criticism . #% Instead , the proposal would have resulted in discriminatory treatment between EU workers and non-EU employees posted to work in the EU . #% EU resources would then be made available to fund key reconstruction activities , such as the rebuilding of basic social infrastructure , including health , education , water and sanitation services . #% 
No European city is without refugees , primarily women , who have been illegally trafficked for the purpose of prostitution . #% This is more than half the original administrative request for an increase of 5.2 % . #% Mr President , Irish Socialists too are very pleased that we have arrived at this moment . #% Estonia , with its growth economy , well illustrates the point , as does the experience of the Republic of Ireland . #% I hope that the Commission will respond positively to Mr Pex 's call for the creation of an EU coastguard , and that the Irish Presidency of the Council will also heed that call , particularly since , in coming from an island , it will appreciate the value of such a body policing our high seas . #% Mr President , I rise to raise an important issue for individual Members of this House relating to Council Question Time . #% I think Mobutu and his coterie of thugs and gangsters who are running that country , drinking pink champagne while their 44 million people have no education , no schools , no health , no hospitals are a disgrace . #% deputising for the author . - I just wish to say that I understand that there is a cross-over here between the different rules . #% Frankly , we are all sick of hearing that and we do not want to hear it any more . #% Finally , in the context of enlargement , the EU must ensure adequate aid for family farmers - the backbone of our rural communities - and , in addition , specific aid to young farmers to ensure the survival of our rural communities and our agricultural sector . #% Therefore , we must ensure that governments are seen to be playing an active role in that regard . #% I welcome the proposal to introduce a Community-wide classification of hotel facilities and the promotion at EU level of voluntary standards concerning measures to improve safety aspects in hotels and tourist services in general . #% The Irish Inherited Disorders Organization has complained that it was misled and misinformed and its position misrepresented . #% I would suggest that this could be done by ending reprocessing now . #% In so far as you have dealt with the issue in broad transatlantic terms , my group welcomes strongly that emphasis . #% We would , of course , have had to leave aside a lot of the self-justification that we all tend to engage in on all sides . #% It is in that context that we should be talking about taxation on passenger cars and indeed all vehicles . #% I believe the amendment covers an adequate compromise . #% Surely we should not be faced with that within the borders of the European Union . #% One solution might be the use of model contracts . #% Were we given powers on condition that we would never use them ? #% This particular initiative has been overtaken . #% The work of the Council must be more consistent , and greater coordination is needed in the administration of the Council . #% The Irish Government has recently indicated its opposition to this measure , having kept its mouth shut very tightly since the subject was first mooted by the Commission in 2000 . #% It is up to Member States to recognize these workers ' rights to fair treatment and I hope that Member States and the Commission - especially Commissioner Monti , who has been rather intransigent on this whole issue and I hope the message can be taken back to him - can agree that those countries that did not apply for the 1985 derogation should have the right to do so now . #% It will be better still with the single currency and it will be good for all small Member States . #% Congratulations again to both rapporteurs . #% It may not be the model which suits every Member State , but it has clear advantages in a small state where certain economies of scale are required in order to deliver the lowest cost and the most efficient production to end-users . #% It is a very important report , and a very important position has been adopted by the Committee on Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . #% That doctor said : ` SOLVIT has restored my confidence in the internal market ' . #% Also yesterday , the Islamic Courts vowed to practice Sharia Law throughout the country and , in particular , in Mogadishu . #% There is a major problem with rewarding the law-breakers . #% That is something I would not want to happen . #% Fundamentalists often try to impose acceptance of their views through legislation . #% It is important that legislators listen to all sides and get the balance right , guided by the unassailable principle of safe food for our citizens . #% There are clear public health risks involved in attracting the wrong type of donors through turning tissue procurement into a commercial activity . #% I would encourage the Council in particular to look at the first thematic issue in detail . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive reply . #% It is unfounded to make allegations like that . #% Mr President , I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply and I am pleased that work is under way and in fact , near finalisation . #% Indeed , I do not know about elsewhere , but in Ireland , the only financial institution left standing that did not require taxpayers ' money to sustain it was the credit union movement , which is a not-for-profit institution run by its members . #% I want to thank too the Commissioner whose name is well known in the border regions and in Northern Ireland and who has made a remarkable contribution to bringing the spirit of European goodwill and cooperation into that divided community . #% It further condemns the attacks on civilians as documented by the International Crisis Group . #% It is often forgotten that packaging waste is only a small proportion of total landfill . #% But there is no equity or fairness when a logbook offence in one country leads to a fine of only EUR 96 , whereas in another country this could lead to the confiscation of boat , catch and gear . #% I have no confidence , given the Irish Government 's failure to date , that they will reach the standards set . #% Mr President , I welcome the broad thrust of the proposals published by the Commission in its annual legislative programme for the year 2000 . #% This has to be of great concern as it flies in the face of the purpose of the fund . #% I like his phrase ` lean and clean ' . #% Protection of European consumers , and of the integrity of the food chain , remain at the heart of the concerns of Members of this House . #% The consumer can not be bound to lose his right to go to court by contracts , as inserted in the report that is before us from the Legal Affairs Committee . #% Mr Patten may bury their heroism , we will see to it that their heroism still lives . #% I support the objective of this directive to minimise the impact of packaging and packaging waste , as long as the costs are proportionate to the environmental benefits . #% We should not forget that over the last 50 years we have worked together to fashion an international legal order covering not just trade and security issues , but also issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms . #% The OSCE has substantially developed since the Moscow mechanism was agreed in 1991 . #% As Mr Davies just pointed out , it is trying to flatter our vanity suggesting we really need to continue testing on animals so that we remain clean , so that we can actually correct body odours ; in other words , that we can improve on nature and change our appearance . #% My group leader , Mr Schulz , has launched a five-point European agenda which seeks to kick-start the process of re-establishing the self-confidence of Europeans . #% I would like to urge the European Union governments to go the extra mile and strike an agreement which will ensure effective operation of the European Union for many years to come . #% When you are illiterate that is impossible . #% It also questions the precautionary principle , on the grounds that this principle would seem to make it more difficult for aquaculture ventures . #% It should also be an opportunity to focus on continuing the development of economic growth and employment and also guaranteeing quality of life , quality jobs and pension entitlements for all people across the EU . #% Failure is relative . #% If we are to achieve anything in this , we must be adventurous and innovative ; we must encourage the development of more small and medium-sized enterprises and more micro-industries in rural areas . #% It is not necessarily a good thing , but it is certainly a lot better than the problem of overspending , which we hear so much about at national level . #% PKK terrorism and the massive military response in the south-east are inflicting real hardship on the region and its population . #% Spain is proposing a law to list certain flags-of-convenience countries and we welcome that . #% 
Even though I voted in favour , I voted with grave and serious reservations . #% The failure to update and review it , to protect people from the effects of radiation rather than to promote nuclear power , is extraordinary . #% The budget is clearly inadequate and has to be increased if this programme is to be properly effective . #% One of the issues that is constantly ignored in Ireland and elsewhere is the contradiction between our spending a considerable amount of money on development aid in assisting developing countries , and yet maintaining a common agricultural system which , at the same time , undermines the very people we claim to be trying to help with our development aid . #% I must say , as a British citizen and , indeed , as a lawyer , that the savage experience of several British citizens abroad buttresses my view that we have little to gain but much to lose from extensive criminal justice integration . #% There is a willingness but fear pervades , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union . #% deputising for the author . - Mr President , I want to thank the Commission for its reply . #% Like other speakers , I would like to support the call for the arms embargo to remain . #% The President of the Commission rightly referred to the importance of research and technology and innovation for the European economy . #% It has facilitated the laundering of up to EUR 30 million from a Turkish construction company located in the Republic of Ireland . #% There are cases where it is necessary on health grounds , but it also needs to be - as the rapporteur has said - very well tracked , and information must be made available to patients . #% We can no longer ignore threats from climate change on coastal erosion . #% We will , however , need to find a balance between providing sufficient food for the world 's population , while producing this food in a way that does not lead to increased negative impacts on the world 's climate . #% Fishmeal is an important protein source and I think that fear alone should not keep it out of the food chain . #% I support this report which proposes a new comprehensive policy approach against gender-based violence including : establishing a criminal-law instrument in the form of a directive against gender-based violence ; training for officials likely to come into contact with cases of violence against women ; requirements for Member States to demonstrate due diligence and to record and investigate all forms of gender-based crimes of violence ; asks for financial support to NGOs working to support victims of violence . #% Saving people 's lives must always come before any doctrine on intellectual property rights . #% Normally I do not take much notice of the lobbying information I get in this Parliament , in particular from industry , but I was amazed at ` Cosmetics - your choice , our responsibility ' from the European Cosmetics , Toiletry and Perfume Association . #% It would be the greatest obscenity to do this work , discover the products and then find that those who need them can not use them . #% In fact , one of Malta 's stronger arguments for entry rests on the close affinities that exist between the island 's economies and the European Union . #% I would like to commend the Greek Government for the manner in which it has overseen the running of the presidency of the European Union for the past six months . #% As I said earlier , when it is acting in the latter role , there is clearly a difference than when it is acting in its role as legislator . #% It took determined international action to open the way for politics to reassert its primacy . #% That would mean , therefore , that amendment 2 will fall , when you take compromise amendment 4 first . #% I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their extremely positive cooperation . #% He was crying crocodile tears at the weekend over this event yet he has tightened the laws in Ireland in every possible way to ensure that asylum-seekers do not come to Ireland to file an application for refugee status , which I would like to reiterate is something that they are entitled to do under the Geneva Convention . #% We need the highest possible level of confidentiality for business , while not compromising human health and the environment , by allowing registrants to use third-party representatives where possible and by protecting against the publication of sensitive business information on the Agency 's website . #% The Council should at least answer that part of the question . #% It is absolutely unacceptable that the US and Britain are allowed to gain advantage from illegal activities . #% Domestic work - family caring , for example - takes place exclusively in the family home . #% We must guard against the tendency to introduce new legislation , particularly at European level , which increases the overall costs of production in our industry and threatens the job security of everybody ultimately employed in the industry . #% So where has the food gone and why have we only a small supply ? #% However , any proposals which are brought forward in this regard , whether it be via the European Commission or otherwise , must be fair and they must be balanced . #% Not only should this be deleted , the whole interception title should be scrapped . #% My understanding is that there is no proven health risk and surely it must be possible to have a factual and credible statement with regard to this . #% We also need to insist -- rather than simply recommending -- that Member States ensure people know that this card is available , that they know how to apply for it , how it can be used and what their rights will be . #% The role of the Ombudsman 's office clearly is to ensure that there is good administration by the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council . #% There has to be accountability here . #% The Commission and Parliament monitor submissions made by each Member State of the Union to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact . #% An intelligent policy to disseminate technological innovation would be one of the skills to counteract this process of polarisation . #% I tabled this question not out of concerns about health or trading issues but out of concern for the credibility of the European Commission . #% Despite the fact that landfill is considered the least-favoured option for waste disposal in Europe , Ireland comes top of the EU list for using landfill to dispose of its huge waste mountains . #% As slow and difficult as that is , it is the only way to find the just solution to this problem . #% Mr President , firstly we all know national provisions on safety training for cabin crew vary widely across the European Union . #% The reason we are discussing this now is because the issue is part of a Commission proposal , and not because it is something that Member States were looking for . #% We welcome this study very much and hope that the Council will now conduct a wide-ranging debate , both within the Council itself and with other sectors of society , about these EU fisheries agreements . #% The approval of this fund represents a key example of Europe 's commitment to helping Ireland out of the recession . #% The principal message of the Small Business Act is to ` think small first ' - to concentrate business legislation across the EU on small and medium-sized enterprises - and the EU has committed tonight to continue the focus on this area . #% The world is a much smaller place now that we are living through the biggest revolution in the history of the world in terms of technology , telecommunications and transport . #% We should all remember that we have a lot to be proud of in Europe at the moment and that the impasse relating to the finalising of a new European Union treaty should not detract from that . #% I , along with all members of the House , would not condone any terrorism , whether institutional or paramilitary . #% Addressing educational disadvantage by providing high quality early childhood education and targeted support , and by promoting inclusive education , are absolutely necessary to create a truly inclusive society . #% We have a budget surplus of nearly 5 % of our gross domestic product . #% This is defined in the legislation as the main place of business of the undertaking , together with its various subsidiary places of business . #% I have had the privilege to visit that plant on behalf of my party in Ireland on two occasions , one of which was the NIREX inquiry . #% That needs to be rectified very quickly . #% Many of us believed that they were doomed from the start , specifically because the EU gave too much too soon , while the US gave very little at the beginning and remained dogged in its position . #% Many of those arriving in certain Member States - and indeed in my own - are being treated extremely badly , particularly by employers who are not themselves subject to the kind of controls that are applied to apparently legal immigrants into the country . #% Rural development should stand on its own two feet . #% I would ask you to support the amendments I have tabled . #% If anything , Europe should be about defending freedom of speech , freedom of thought and freedom of ideas , even though we may not agree with those ideas or thoughts . #% I can not be totally responsible for the way tabloid newspapers report things but I am still saying that I stand by what I said . #% What would you recommend as a result of all this assessment and forthcoming studies ? #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the livestock sector is an important traditional farming industry which represents the livelihood of thousands of producers across the EU . #% Nevertheless , the amount of money which we spend has a minimal impact on monetary or economic policy within this Community , while national governments are not cutting back spending . #% They are angry and frustrated at the sclerosis that exists in the decision-making processes of the European Union and indeed the United Nations . #% A European company without participation in some form is unthinkable . #% 
Farmers are getting older and young people are reluctant to take up farming as a career . #% That is why , more than anything else today , we need to put this regulation in place . #% ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States . #% Mr Patten has just recommended what could be called a terrorist charter for Northern Ireland . #% I often feel that in this conflict , courage is not being shown . #% At the moment , unprocessed wool is being exported out of the Union . #% In that regard , I welcome the recent decision by Commissioner Barrot to introduce new guidelines laying down conditions under which start-up aid can be granted to airlines in regional airports . #% Mr President , just before you commence the voting , I would like to draw your attention to the rules of this House and to the avalanche of lobbyists that are in the corridor outside this House . #% To conclude , it is imperative that we , at European level , address ourselves towards ensuring a future for European agriculture . #% Every means possible , including confiscation of assets , which we introduced in Ireland , must be part and parcel of an internationally agreed strategy . #% I hope we have achieved that and that it will be reflected in a strong endorsement of the report tomorrow . #% The Irish Ombudsman has described the scheme , as introduced by the Irish Government , as seriously deficient and grossly flawed . #% Like others , I want to express my deepest sympathies to the relatives and friends of those who have died . #% The Mauritius agreement is very similar to the one with Madagascar , Mauritius being a neighbouring island . #% Mr President , in the spring of next year there will be a referendum in Ireland to decide whether or not to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty . #% I note with interest that the agenda for this debate which we are having today is headed `` follow-up to Nice '' . #% Consumer confidence in beef has been severely undermined and consumption levels have declined by anything up to 30 % . #% Realists accept and understand that life is full of risks . #% It will not survive as an industry unless the public believe in a strongly instilled and strictly enforced safety culture . #% I am also especially concerned that the action plan should be improved to include truly efficient and responsive health monitoring systems . #% Payment can take many forms in terms of expenses or just compensating for lost hours at work , as distinct from profit in terms of payment . #% Mr President , I wish to compliment the President of the Court of Auditors on his report this morning and I want to raise one particular matter . #% Yes , we need self-regulation and partnership , but Internet service providers have to prioritise this . #% Extra national funding is , therefore , the only resort and has to be found . #% John Cushnahan and I have published a seven-point initiative on measures , which could help to clarify the issues and to assuage fears in Ireland . #% More than a quarter of a million innocent people have been killed since 2003 , and a further 2.5 million people have been displaced . #% I appeal to the Commissioner to come to Ireland , both North and South , hear the fisherman at first hand and act for them and the future of this industry . #% The sexual exploitation of children , including child pornography on the Internet , in any form , is abhorrent . #% We in Ireland were spared the worst because of our geographical location and , in no small measure , because of the extreme exemplary precautions taken by the Irish authorities - a fact referred to in today 's report . #% SAVE II could be an example of how funding can be used in other EU programmes such as structural funds and funding for third countries . #% We must ensure that fishermen ' s rights to earn their living are not hindered by ridiculous regulation . #% I am not saying the Commission is perfect , but we can not oblige the Commission to say `` you must crack the whip and every Member State in the European Union will respond '' , because it will not happen . #% Mr Oostlander has been one of the great contributors to this Parliament . #% The result of their consensual approach has been to strengthen and unify the voice of the European Parliament on the key issue at stake . #% The European Union must promote a greater level of dialogue with America to streamline the rules governing the operating of the accountancy industry . #% The Commission is not a clearing house for policies and the Commission must take forward our structural fund programmes ; it must also take forward the territorial and local employment pacts and give direction in this area through concrete actions and coordination activities . #% The Council and the Commission also ganged up in an appalling effort to push through the legislation on providing personal data records relating to air transport to the United States , in the face of opposition from the European Parliament . #% Finally , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her willingness to compromise , and the Irish presidency for its determination in forcing all parties to come to agreement . #% The barriers of the past in Ireland will be eroded and a new Ireland will evolve . #% Obviously , tourism and terrorism do not mix and as an area meant to be emerging for good from the dark shadow of terrorism , we in Northern Ireland are beginning , I am glad to say , to see a steady gain from increased tourism . #% Another lesson that is important , not from SAVE I but from the regional programme , is that you must incorporate measures on energy efficiency into the regional work of the EU and its policies . #% It is unacceptable to legislate on the basis of making science fit regulation . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I welcome the report . #% There can be no neutrality when we are confronted with a brutal genocidal dictator such as Slobodan Milosevic . #% Finally , I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation . #% Those are natural disagreements , which we can have . #% Indeed , in many areas of disability rights Spanish law is a model that other Member States could usefully follow with regard to integration , access and equal treatment . #% Hence we must keep raising this issue on occasions such as this . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner if he will implement an effective promotional campaign in relation to beef and also a factual , credible information campaign for consumers ? #% It is surely clear as we enter a new millennium that Europe is not and can not be a rigid unification but rather a rich diversification . #% Ireland , perhaps more than any other EU Member State , bears witness to the practical realisation of the aspirations and dreams of the EU 's founding fathers . #% Unless and until we have a sufficient intelligence capability matching that of the US and the transport capabilities to put EU military personnel into world trouble spots quickly , we will continue to need a close working relationship with NATO underpinned by a structured EU-NATO dialogue which is not simply a replication of the WEU/NATO acquis . #% As was pointed out previously , the EU makes a major contribution together with the United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . #% We need stability and we need to get down to the business of policy as quickly as possible . #% Mr President , for clarification , my group was also an author of this resolution but somehow we got dropped off the list . #% That is good for the market , good for prices and will lead to a more orderly situation in which prices will be easier to maintain . #% The Europe which we are building must favour an inclusive and caring society in which the interests of all must be respected . #% No link has been made in the inspectors ' report to international terrorism . #% Unless we show them leadership and a sense of purpose , a sense of direction , they will make their judgements in the coming years . #% Our citizens will want to know why we want to spend more on space research than on sustainable transport . #% This whole programme can be made more acceptable if this happens . #% In many Member States including my own , farmers and rural dwellers do not enjoy the same levels of broadband access , putting them at a distinct disadvantage in comparison with people who live in cities and towns . #% Furthermore , the existence of poverty and unemployment throughout the Union constitute continuing breaches of fundamental human rights . #% I believe we should use the existing established structures of the special beef premium and suckler cow grants , both of which are part of the agreed CAP framework , as a means of determining the shareout of the additional funds between Member States while at the same time allowing individual governments to decide how best the package can be applied to each sector . #% They tell the IRA terrorists in my country that they can hold on to their weapons which have murdered my constituents , both Roman Catholic and Protestant , and be welcomed at the White House and Downing Street . #% First of all with regard to all EU fisheries agreements , not just Moroccan agreements : they should follow the precautionary approach . #% 
Transport is , of course , a particularly difficult area and action is needed . #% Certainly in my group we have not prepared a list of speakers , nor do we wish to revert to that procedure at this moment . #% However , from the outset let me say that aquaculture must be fully integrated into the common fisheries policy . #% One of the primary challenges now for the European Union and the broader international community is to ensure that there is a resumption of an active and effective mediation process within the Middle East . #% Mr Stevenson is too young to remember the cod wars which were fought around the coast of Iceland in my lifetime - in fact , at a time when I was already in politics . #% Madam President , is there really much point in our debating human rights in these countries unless the EU is prepared to act on the stipulation in its bilateral agreements with Cambodia , Laos and Vietnam that respect for human rights is a condition for the continuance of EU aid ? #% It is regrettable , but it must be said that there are legitimate concerns about the role of the security forces . #% May I also briefly mention how the situation is affecting the pig and poultry industry . #% I want to speak directly to the Spanish President-in-Office at this point . #% A second general point I should like to refer to is in respect of the efficiency of policy . #% We could do rather more , considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports . #% I cautiously welcome Prime Minister Sharon 's announced intention of complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip , but there are a number of conditions that must be met in the context of future Israeli withdrawal from Gaza . #% I would also like to thank Mr Cohn-Bendit for devoting so much attention to me , as always . #% Would not an opinion have sufficed , given the very heavy political fall-out from the recommendation in Ireland , where we are in an election year and very likely face a referendum on Nice , this episode has been oats to the eurosceptics . #% We should not be supporting a reference to a zero quota , which is no longer the Australian position . #% In these three strands we are talking of the inclusion of what was excluded which is a major focus of democracy in the European Union . #% One has no objection to that . #% Ireland fits somewhere between the continental European social model and the Anglo-Saxon model . #% The amount of money that has been privately donated has been extraordinary . #% Madam President , many Irish priests have gone to work in the Philippines and have distinguished themselves in their fight for human rights and for bettering the lot of the people there . #% The European Commission has proposed a budget of over EUR 200 million for the administration of the EU Erasmus World initiative for the years 2004 to 2008 . #% To farmers the price received in the marketplace should represent the real value of their professional endeavours , rather than what they often perceive as social support for the products of their labour . #% We can never justify the means we use to beat terrorism by claiming that the ends are noble . #% Therefore , my group will be voting for the compromise text debated yesterday . #% Reform must take place in such a way that it ensures that the interests of all Member States are taken into account in a balanced manner and above all else , that the interests of farmers and rural communities are fully respected . #% The provisions of the Treaty of Nice can not come into effect until the ratification process has been concluded within the 15 Member States of the Union . #% Demand for GM food is not driven by consumers . #% For example , the insides of televisions can now be made completely of plastic instead of plastic and metal , making them easier to recycle . #% It was clear when I was in Canada in 1990 that nothing had been done on it up to then . #% There must also be a necessary reserve of key energy products in stock . #% It has recently been revealed that international paedophile groups are targeting child-friendly sites on the Internet to trace potential victims . #% Secondly , there are various considerations regarding the different directives which have gone through Parliament , the Council and Commission in the recent past with regard to design and models ; some thought might also be given to standardizing safety features within the automobile sector to ensure they are made available , not necessarily as extras but also as part of the normal construction of automobiles to guarantee the safety not only of the drivers but also of the passengers and pedestrians . #% As regards the issue of scope and whether the proposed regulations should take in all aspects of animal health and welfare , or only those aspects impinging on food safety , I am glad that in the final analysis the Council accepted the wider scope that was urged by Parliament . #% It is clear that the likely direction of the decision-making process within the Parliament and within the European Council is going to be based on codecision and majority voting procedures . #% It will not , however , bring them justice : for this , I call on those present on that fateful night to have courage and testify against those who committed this crime . #% The great car culture has been referred to before in European Parliament reports as the main culprit of air pollution in Europe and Parliament is now playing an active role in establishing limit values for various pollutants so as to bring this environmental problem under control . #% Rather than lay out a wish list of every new policy or new idea , I want to touch very briefly on some of the points you raised and try to re-emphasise those within our role and work here in Parliament . #% Let us make it known that the EU programme against social exclusion can be matched by the crime prevention strategy . #% And because your statement is being used by Pakistan 's embassies worldwide to undermine our report , you betrayed the EU mission you sent into the field and I say on their behalf , shame on you . #% I can assure the House that the concerns which Mr Smith raises here - and I appreciate his comments and may I say go raibh mile maith agat - are issues which are regularly raised when meetings of this kind take place . #% So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money . #% Yes , in the past the agreements have been acceptable , but we need a new approach and a new vision in the future . #% It would not make sense for us to have a debate without the President of the Commission . #% This is not an acceptable situation . #% As regards sulphates and sulphides , it is clear that they cause asthma and , in the worst cases , death ensues . #% Mr President , firstly heartiest congratulations to Claude Desama for achieving this uncompleted business for us over the time-scale involved . #% Two-thirds of Europe 's workforce are currently employed in enterprises employing less than 250 people . #% The whole debate on pharmaco-vigilance versus the compulsory five-year review , and the question of whether to centralise the registration procedure or keep the centralised , national and mutual recognition procedures is critical . #% The institutions have worked hard to ensure that the burden for industry , and particularly SMEs , is not too costly , will protect confidential business information , reduce red tape and will not threaten jobs , whilst still delivering a win-win situation for citizens , workers and our ecosystem . #% I want to pay tribute to them and all the workers who put together this wonderful building . #% I accept his right to his strongly-held orthodox Catholic views . #% Four priority areas were identified where progress is essential namely #% I hope that we do not anticipate the same delay in relation to this very vital service . #% The White Paper proposes to tackle this situation by gradually breaking the link between transport growth and economic growth or an increase in GDP , while recognising that economic growth will generate greater needs for mobility . #% In my own country of Ireland we have been able to silence the gun and bring communities together that we never thought imaginable . #% Although the report does not go far enough in relation to the eight hours , paragraph 1 is extremely important . #% I should like the President-in-Office to say that the Council is going to address these issues and will bring these points of concern into a code of conduct , otherwise it is just window-dressing . #% Illegal human trafficking in the EU is now worth over EUR 4 billion annually . #% Over the five years up to 2001 , for example , imports into the EU have included 5.4 million live birds , equal to 87 % of global trade , with Portugal and Spain being the main importers ; over one million live reptiles , equal to 16 % of global trade , with Spain and Germany being the main importers ; seven million live cacti and 15 million live orchids , mainly going to the Netherlands ; and 383 tonnes of sturgeon caviar , 40 % of the global trade , which went mainly to France and Germany . #% Over the past number of years the European Union has been doing the right thing by trying to convince other countries to be reasonable in relation to the kind of quotas they set for themselves . #% Together with the SAVE Programme , we have in ALTENER II a way of showing the public of Europe that there are rational ways to meet the challenge of climate change : energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy . #% We are dealing with viable , solvent democracies and while we have to note that the age profile has become lower - the debt is not as old as it used to be - nevertheless , there is no good reason why EUR 2.2 billion should be outstanding . #% That is unfortunate because it is difficult to promote them as measures before we have some sort of evaluation . #% Those who will not learn the lessons of history condemn themselves and society to repeat that history . #% If the Commission would - as we have requested for years - have an independent nuclear inspectorate look into the Sellafield operation , they would have found this out some years ago . #% We were there to evaluate progress on human rights issues and the effects of reforms on the ground . #% 
In particular I welcome the information it contains regarding the EU-China human rights dialogue . #% It is very hard to understand why we do not have better cooperation from all the Member States . #% Can you be sure , Commissioner , that an enlightened view will be taken , in particular by Mr Monti , the Commissioner responsible for competition , to ensure that we have private sector innovative approaches to reducing regional disparities across the Union ? #% East Timor is a country cursed with oil and gas . #% Ms Bellamy , who directed UNICEF after Mr Grant , was forced to resign last year . #% Therefore , I ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the amendments and to recognise them in the spirit in which they have been tabled , as a genuine attempt to ensure that Europe develops good patent law in the field of computer-implemented inventions . #% The second criteria is that the regional approach should be followed . #% In relation to the other Treaty provisions , the suggestion has been put forward very strongly that we should incorporate in the Treaty specific references to children and their rights as citizens . #% I am generally in favour of Article 175 but against extra bans . #% Our strategy requires not only that people be given training and skills but also that there be no discrimination between men and women . #% The priorities of the current presidency are environment , jobs and crime . #% If this Parliament wants to show solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland it should perhaps consider sending a delegation there for that march . #% Rather than take up Parliament 's time explaining how successful my party has been in government in creating employment and protecting workers ' rights , I would like to invite him to discuss its merits and demerits over a drink . #% Will LEADER retain its identity and independence as a Community initiative with a high level of voluntary Community participation ? #% Half the population of Gaza is under 25 years of age and there is 60 % unemployment in the area . #% Mr President , the Committee on Industry agreed to vote on this item only on condition that the Commission would come to the Chamber and give an explanation as to the procedure , and would give us certain assurances . #% Debates of recent months have highlighted and prioritised the public health aspect of European and national food policy of which BSE is the most significant . #% Mr President , as the last speaker said , the brutal killing of this human rights activist is unacceptable , and the fact that the government there seems totally unwilling to do anything to protect the lives of its citizens is appalling . #% Mr President , notwithstanding the fact that Agenda 2000 has set the parameters governing agriculture for the period up to 2006 , the annual price package is still very important . #% In Ireland smoking kills six times as many people per year as road accidents , work accidents , murder , drugs , suicide and Aids combined . #% In fact , you yourself , Commissioner , used the word subsidy . #% We must be logical . #% The free movement of safe and wholesome food and feed is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and wellbeing of citizens and their social and economic interests . #% Alongside this , the whole question of education and the kind of skills training that is given to people must be brought into focus . #% I wish that all blood and blood products came from voluntary , unpaid sources . #% That suggests : ` Domestic violence against women is the main cause of death and invalidity among women between the ages of 16 and 44 . ' #% This Parliament and the institutions have to send a very strong message to the Burmese authorities that international bodies must immediately have access to her . #% I ask all Members to support this resolution . #% To oblige An Post to now apply VAT to its postal services could well be the death knell of the company . #% He said : ` Council 's judgment was ' , and the statement that was issued was ` Council 's judgment ' . #% It is more important that it be well spent than that it be all spent . #% It is understandable to be concerned about poultry welfare , but there is no sense in so hyping welfare requirements in the EU that we drive producers out of business and become dependent on imports from Far Eastern and South American countries where no enforceable welfare restraints apply to production . #% Not only because of my opposition to the grand design of which it is part but because it diminishes the protection of my constituents against unfairness , I oppose this proposal . #% The report of Amnesty International clearly raises many human rights issues which remain of serious concern to the Council . #% The Council will be following developments closely with a view to taking further action if such action is considered appropriate . #% However , before a date can be set for the commencement of negotiations for entry , further proof must be forthcoming that this reform programme is being implemented . #% There is no doubt about the existence of a growing cocktail of chemicals in our daily lives . #% Coercion and coordination are two diametrically opposed political and human theories . #% Diabetes is a good example of a disease that is under-funded in my wealthy constituency . #% I wish to refer in particular to the proposals on the fingerprinting of illegal immigrants . #% Such a body is not democratically accountable by any definition , but these amendments would allow them to challenge the Commission without providing evidence of how or by whom they are funded or for what purpose . #% Now the question asks how the EU Commission evaluates whether the states that benefit from preferential trade agreements with the EU protect workers ' rights and protect human rights . #% There is plenty of evidence of the inhuman treatment of cats and dogs bred for fur . #% The Commission , whilst pushing for the International Convention on the Protection of the Alps , states that the protocols have been ratified , but not everyone has ratified the transport protocol . #% I would hope that next September we will have something where each initiative , in methodological terms , is justified . #% In Ireland , such fears have not been grounded on concrete economic analysis but on anecdotal evidence of the negative change that the Services Directive bring . #% I am convinced that the difficult political problems in Iraq can only be effectively addressed in Iraq under the auspices of the United Nations . #% A gradual improvement in the regulations will contribute in the long term to the future health of the marine environment for the generations that will come after us . #% I am particularly supportive of paragraph 13 of Mrs Smet 's report which urges that refugee status be given to those women who are threatened with the kind of violence that has already been outlined here . #% In essence we need an integrated approach , not a piecemeal one ; an approach that binds together and builds up existing programmes and policy initiatives in order to create a more effective whole . #% The Conciliation Committee has also agreed to enable Member States to retain and implement more favourable arrangements in respect of the victim than the provisions required so as to ensure compliance with this directive . #% Mr President , with the agreement of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I should like to amend the wording of the new paragraph 2a to read : ' ... calls on the Saudi Arabian Government to lift restrictions on women 's free movement ( including the to drive ) - there is a change of word there - , on employment opportunities , on their legal personality and on their representation in judicial process ' . #% There is an old saying in the media that if it bleeds , it leads ; the more dramatic the image , the better chance it has of making the headlines . #% The cost will not be proportional to the environmental benefit . #% There are a number of aspects of this resolution , in relation also to defence budgets , which promote the militarisation of Europe . #% Therefore , future agricultural and environmental policy must reflect our experiences in this crucial area of food production . #% Maybe it is too late tonight , but it is important . #% This action plan of the Commission 's is unambitious . #% It is making an impact with the citizens . #% It is incumbent upon us to find a better way rather than witness the senseless slaughter we have recently seen . #% Worse than that , if we got it wrong in July , we might want a second bite of the cherry next January and act more vigorously then than need be . #% It ought to be possible to combine economic reform and competition policy with strong and sound social justice and social progress principles . #% We really need to tighten up our regulations . #% Madam President , listening to a number of speakers here today , one of the most effective measures that the EU has is to impose fines on Member States for not honouring their obligations under EU law . #% The rapporteur is to be complimented on her efforts to take on board the experiences of those directly involved and I particularly wish to acknowledge the fact that the views of the Irish agency , Largos , are reflected in the text . #% While I welcome the general commitment towards ensuring the health and safety of workers and also guaranteeing that there is cohesion across the Member States with regard to the minimum protection that will be available , I fear for certain sectors . #% 
So before this House and the EU parade their human rights credentials , I say : let it set about righting that wrong , implementing the directive on employment in its entirety and ending the outrageous discrimination against the majority community in my country . #% I admire a man who is willing to say that he may have made mistakes in the past but now we are moving forward . #% Not only do SMEs provide valuable employment , accounting for 80 % of new jobs in the EU in recent years , but they also play a key social role in stimulating local economies , diversifying employment and encouraging entrepreneurship . #% I once again pay tribute to the rapporteur . #% Mr President , next year will be the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome , when the European Economic Community called for the abolition of the obstacles to the free movement of persons , goods , services and capital as the main objectives towards achieving a common or internal market . #% Or is it still on the table for discussion and can it arise again for discussion in the near future ? #% Unfortunately , the amendment to preserve the opt-out clause was defeated and thus the rest of Europe is lining up to foist upon us a Working Time Directive which is largely unsupported within the United Kingdom . #% He was an unrepentant terrorist who introduced to the world the horror of the human suicide bomber . #% We added another EUR 400 million in relation to animal health measures . #% We have done too little to alleviate the pain and distress of these children and their families . #% What sort of a precedent is this setting for other mavericks in the near neighbourhood of Europe , if somebody who threatens nuclear development , makes xenophobic comments about a nearby state and threatens international security is to get a package ? #% If the French want to label beef they can do so voluntarily . #% This can not happen without additional physical capacity , in the form of trans-European energy networks , to connect us all to a European grid . #% Unless we address the very serious problem of the declining age profile in European agriculture , in the not too distant future Parliament will be sitting in an emergency session to address what has turned out to be a very serious problem . #% Now the Commission has published its guidelines for 2002 , all Member States , including Ireland , should openly negotiate its position , make it clear to the public at home what their position is , so that when the time comes and budgets are being implemented based around those guidelines , the public knows exactly why that is being done . #% It should not just be a privilege for us to have Mr Solana present ; perhaps he should be here on a more regular basis . #% This Parliament has a central role to play in this and must take on board its responsibilities , but the Council and the Commission must give us greater cooperation . #% I should like to link this with other matters we have debated at previous part-sessions - indeed I am sure we will be debating them again this week - and make an appeal about the language we use to describe these terrorists . #% Looking at the philosophical principles that create peace , what the peoples of Europe did was to build institutions - and those three institutions are represented here today - which fully respect the differences of their peoples . #% We have heard that it is the biggest killer , that 5 million people die a year , 95 % of them in poor countries . #% It is only reasonable that we should seek to establish that this money goes to the farmers and applies to the hectares , as Mr Casaca has suggested . #% in writing . - I , along with my Labour colleagues , voted in favour of the Berès report because of my support for the vast majority of its contents . #% I do not want to be difficult in saying that we would vote against it , but , as Mr Posselt has said , we have to be careful about setting precedents . #% Also , the EU prohibits trade in its own wild birds under the Birds and Habitats directives . #% I also support Amendment 9 , which is in the same vein . #% As we know , complementary medicine is practised by thousands of people each year throughout Europe and it has been discussed at length at European level over recent years . #% In this regard , I support proposals for a further update of the 1997 directive with the caution that it must be done in a sensible way . #% Would it not have been wiser to summon a meeting of the heads of state for an important decision like this which - remember - will have consequences long after our time here in the European Parliament ? #% UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has correctly described that invasion as an illegal act contravening the UN Charter . #% These innovations will help to reduce CO2 emissions , fuel consumption and noise pollution . #% Much of the hope of the impoverished third world - currently the portion of the globe suffering under the heaviest burdens of death and misery from HIV/AIDS , malaria and TB - is vested in our ability to offer funding for research and medicines that are effective , easy to use and affordable . #% In order to ensure maximum development in the ACP regions it is essential to take on board the question of peace and security . #% Finally , I welcome the continued efforts of Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten to renew a cease-fire in the region . #% In Europe much has already been done to fight cyber crime . #% Mr President , I would like to support the point raised by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , the rapporteur , and I welcome the initiative proposed by the Commission to provide a basic instrument to fund and to promote organisations active in the field of equality between men and women at European level . #% Having expressed my opposition to many aspects previously , I will be happy to support Mr Wuermeling 's report provided the amendments on so-called ` responsible lending ' , the compulsory use of credit reference databases and the exemption for mortgages are all adopted , and provided the so-called credit union amendments , 4 and 61 , are supported by this House . #% The European Union has to take responsibility on this issue . #% They were being encouraged to learn but were also being fed . #% Likewise , under the consumer credit directive , the provider of the service is required to inform the consumer of certain rights , certain entitlements , certain get-out clauses as well . #% We need to have something at the end that we can be proud of , to allow people to participate in society . #% Livelihoods and biodiversity suffer as a result of overexploitation of wildlife for food . #% It was an irresponsible amendment which seeks to maintain Regulations ( EC ) Nos 2847/93 and 685/95 for a period of 10 years . #% We constantly obstruct their path towards enjoying a full human existence . #% There is clearly a need for more thorough checking of containers at the point of departure and arrival and for closer cooperation between the authorities in different countries . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on having the wisdom of Solomon , the patience of Job and the tenacity of myself . #% Mr President , I welcome this opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate and to open with the comment that an early and satisfactory resolution of the controversy surrounding food safety is of paramount importance to consumers , to our farmers and indeed to the food industry . #% Of course , we need infrastructure in science facilities and communications . #% An issue which should be addressed concerns the sourcing of funding aid through the European Fisheries Fund for inshore fishermen badly affected by legislative or policy changes relating to their fishery . #% It is clear , as the Commissioner said , that we need to address this in our development and aid policies . #% The EU has a responsibility to raise the profile , by all available means , of the continuing scandal of what amounts to modern-day slavery . #% Europe is very fortunate at this particular time to have the presidency held by a Prime Minister who is one of the longest-serving heads of government in any of our Member States . #% For us it is not just the principle of involving the local partners - it actually makes good sense because they know the issues on the ground . #% No evidence has been found which establishes that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction - the contrary in fact . #% First of all I would like to support very much what my colleague Mr Piétrasanta said and say that our group will be voting for the reports by Mr Piétrasanta and Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna . #% Over-fishing or over-exploitation of any limited resource will damage that resource to the detriment of all and therefore is absolutely unsustainable . #% The last one was in Beijing in January and I wish to ask the Commission representatives present here today when is it intended to have the next such meeting ? #% Whatever penalty the courts will decide for these people I do not believe the death penalty is right . #% As I said , this is an own goal and we will end up importing products from the US via the Internet . #% All Member States must introduce - urgently - nationwide breast screening . #% The report commissioned for the June conference warned that the international financial system has become a money launderer 's dream , processing a large part of the estimated $ 200 billion worth of drugs money every year . #% The road map that they set out is that by the year 2025 the first cars will be in mass production , and that by 2035 they will be in widespread use across the US . #% Recent events in Burma also show the need for decisive action at EU level . #% I hope that in the years ahead , particularly in the Convention and the subsequent IGC , we can succeed in ensuring that the commitment that began to be developed in Lisbon and subsequently in Nice can be incorporated and deepened in a constitution for the European Union which guarantees that we have not only a competitive Europe but a Europe that cares equally for all of its citizens . #% You were able to find a way for those countries to ensure that their vital national interests were not overturned or upset , in particular as regards the doctrine of conferral within that Treaty , clarifying the issues of subsidiarity and proportionality , as well as ensuring the continuation of equality between all Member States and in the application of the rules . #% You only have to look at a photograph of the Heads of States of the European Union and compare the number of men and of women - it is just not acceptable . #% We can not aspire to a social inclusion process and produce lots and lots of documents outlining how to achieve it if , at the same time , we do not ensure that this process is mainstreamed in our initiatives . #% 
We need to look at the long-term energy issue from the perspective of economic viability and sustainability . #% This is a pity , because I would like it to strategically plan so as to be able to look at the workers that are not included in the Agency 's vigilance for health and safety . #% In conclusion , I urge all Members to support this and to give more hope for the future of the European Union . #% They do not want to hear about moral issues . #% Finally , let us not forget that the Lisbon Agenda is about making the EU the most competitive economy in the world by 2015 . #% We do not want to create a situation where airlines will decide to fly regardless of what the outcome will be . #% It has been said that he has three jobs but only one salary . #% We all recognise that the European Union , in spite of economic recovery , is still working well below par for too many people ; specifically for 15 million of our fellow citizens the EU is simply not working at all . #% The issue of decommissioning funds is one that has been rightly raised and is of great concern . #% We share with you , Mr Spring , your assertion that the primacy of politics must be reclaimed and restored , and support your efforts in this regard . #% I believe that establishing and maintaining contacts with the peoples of the Union 's Southern and Eastern neighbours through education and training activities is of crucial importance . #% People with problems , like people with pains , want relief and they want it as quickly and as inexpensively as possible . #% We should be under no illusion that in time co-financing of the CAP will inevitably lead to its renationalisation . #% We should not be seen as an enemy of the Council and the Commission , nor as a subservient body , but as a willing and equal partner to them . #% Despite this , two years later in 2003 , exit penalties worth about 20 % of the value of Equitable Life policies were imposed on Irish policyholders . #% Take Ireland in 2001 , where we had a foot-and-mouth outbreak and the country came to a standstill . #% Will you insist that the information and data sources used to set the targets in the second round of NAPs will be publicly available to allow independent verification and to ensure maximum benefit for the climate and fair competition across the single market ? #% What hope have the poor and working people outside the borders of Europe in view of that situation ? #% I thank Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for her support of the Committee on Women 's Rights ' opinion and look forward to the gender perspective being an important aspect of the European Research Area . #% There are social , political and economic factors that must be considered before we reach conclusions . #% I am pleased we have highlighted the gender issue and asked Member States to deal with the issue of men and women who take time off to care and that we have paid attention to the issue of mobility and the role of the EU 2020 strategy . #% It supports difficult areas both in the south and north of the Community . #% I believe that within the present text we have the opportunity to reconcile these two parties , and to lay down a number of fundamental principles which could be copied in other parts of the world . #% If that were the case , they would not need ratification from all 15 Member States . #% It is essential to ensure that more information is available concerning the emission levels from within the Member States of the Union . #% The provision of proper conditions for live animals moving from one Member State to another must be guaranteed . #% This bill is a wholesale departure from both Irish and British Government agreements and the Cory recommendations . #% You have more to do . , which means ` thank you ' . #% This gives some certainty to the scientific community of the European Union , it allows some important programmes to proceed , it gives us a clean sheet for the Fifth Framework Programme and it allows money to be spent with a legal base . #% However , despite my strong commitment to the process of enlargement , I acknowledge that we face real dilemmas during the process . #% These are fundamental to an open market . #% We must desist from getting into the ` nanny state ' frame of mind . #% What has it been doing for the last 14 days ? #% Has the time not come to be more robust and to consider sanctions in trade , if that is necessary and is the only thing that will deliver implementation of human rights ? #% Of course , it is not just the company that has a responsibility . #% The creation of Europol represented a major step forward in this context . #% Will the Commission take legal action in these Member States to try to recover the assets looted from that country so that they can be used for the reconstruction of the new Democratic Republic of Congo ? #% Moreover , the Irish Greens have always argued that a neutral and impartial player should be brought in , like the United Nations . #% Clever people all over Europe are waiting to hear what we decide this week , because next year they will be able to use their brains on our behalf . #% It is undeniable that there are still marked disparities in existing Member States and I therefore support the proposal for transitional funding arrangements for Community aid in existing Objective 1 areas post-2006 . #% There are excellent ideas in this document ; I am not trying to minimise them . #% On a separate matter , the European Commission has already stated that the reduction in the use of tobacco products will be a key political objective of this European Commission . #% EU leaders have agreed to set the end of the year 2002 as the deadline for the EU 's internal preparations , notably the ratification of any institutional changes which are agreed at the future IGC . #% Organised criminal gangs with vast resources that are illegally trafficking human beings into the European Union can not be allowed , under any circumstances , to operate with impunity . #% We devote a lot of time in the European Union to making sure that the highest standards in farming are met ; our livestock is well treated and healthy ; our produce is safe ; our farming practices ethical in relation to their impact on the environment . #% The Israeli Government must come to realise that missiles , demolitions , apartheid walls and assassinations will not guarantee or bring it sustainable peace . #% How is it that 117 or 118 new items not foreseen were added ? #% He has a point and a minority of people in this Parliament agree with that . #% Domestic violence against women and children is clearly a crime and I strongly support amendments that have highlighted that . #% From the earliest times many of us learned the story of St Joseph taking the child and his mother to Egypt because King Herod planned to kill him . #% This ambiguity in the role and responsibilities of surveyors across Europe needs to be rectified in order to ensure a harmonised system and a level playing field . #% We need a permanent solution . #% We have excellent ambassadors there but they simply do not have the structures to make the necessary impact on the political situation . #% in writing . - I voted for this report as Europe 's 10-12 million Roma should benefit from binding minimum standards at EU level to improve their access to employment , education , housing and healthcare . #% Therefore , we need our scientists to get their heads together on this and resolve it . #% I fully support the need for efficient databases . #% Of course , rural development has a much wider remit : it provides for restructuring of rural regions and it allows for environmental protection and for measures to improve the quality of life for rural people . #% When influenza successfully infects a new species , it can reassort , and may switch from being an avian to a mammalian one . #% Mr President , you have made a great start . #% I would like to mention , as some of my colleagues have , the issue of the ` pipeline children ' , the inter-country adoptions . #% I am glad , because it would send a very dangerous signal at this time . #% Other measures are mentioned in the report , such as implementing new technical measures , compulsory landing of catches in specific fishing ports and a fixed reference price for non-human-consumption species . #% In all the regions of the EU which are just emerging from economic backwardness we must realise that there is still a serious burden of the past to be carried . #% In fact , the contrary is the clear message . #% Mr President , I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this very important topic , which is most pertinent to my constituency of Connaught Ulster , covering virtually the entire northern and western coasts of Ireland . #% We need to acknowledge ... #% 
If we are to begin to bring an end to this spiral of violence , then someone has to take the first leap . #% The only way forward for any just society in this day and age should be to promote the policy that the Irish Government has endorsed . #% The Commission taught Member States over the years how to be open with very limited resources . #% Mr President , the goalposts have now changed , given the sheer level of inhumanity shown by terrorists pursuing their so-called political objectives . #% I strongly support this trend . #% Given the value of this work , it is inexplicable that he should have been treated so aggressively by the Philippine authorities . #% I also wish to thank the President of the Commission for his contribution and to say that my group will strongly support the main thrust of what the Commission President said here today . #% The aim of the report is to initiate an action programme in the field of consumer protection for the years 2007 to 2013 . #% We feel more concern about cheap supplies to processors than about the income of the fishermen whose interests we are supposed to support . #% Whether we like it or not , that is what we are facing , plus the fact that aquaculture is an extremely dangerous industry in the impact it has on the environment . #% The potential is clear : if the European Union , today , in its Member States , were to attain the best practice already achieved by its existing states and by its competitors we would have 30 million more jobs , twice as many as are currently unemployed . #% What mandate , if any , has the Council given the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the European Union in relation to the United Nations Convention on People with Disabilities ? #% Mr Blair , you were right to say that we must modernise Europe 's social model on the basis of a strong economy and not at the expense of it . #% This programme would include strategies for intensifying research into the causes of the disease , for identification of risk factors , for prevention and treatment and for encouraging specific training of health and geriatric care staff . #% They have all been quite horribly murdered by people coming from some of the accession states to the Community . #% Will excise duties vary for on-board sales as ferries and planes cross between territorial waters ? #% However , it contains some good points and I welcome the perspective outlined for us by the President of the Commission , and the Vice-President of the Commission in particular , in pushing the idea of a Plan D and taking up on those good points and moving forward . #% I have this problem in my own constituency . #% Above all , it should serve as well as possible the important environmental objectives it purports to achieve . #% We need to make sure that the laws are fully implemented so that the children abandoned and in care receive the proper treatment they deserve . #% Short-sea shipping carries 41 % of goods traffic within the Community . #% Persistent failures at the BNFL Sellafield nuclear facility put at risk the health and wellbeing of those who work there , their surrounding communities and those living on the east coast of Ireland . #% I suggest that we should consider appointing a political envoy from the European Union to Iraq to see if we can broker some sort of peace , between the United Nations and Iraq , because the sanctions are genocidal in their effect . #% Farming is a difficult life : long hours , hard work , high investment and many risks . #% Consumer and investor confidence is waning , the value of global and stock markets is down too . #% Who influenced you ? #% I do not believe in tax harmonisation . #% Madam President , the agreement reached at Nice will now pave the way for the enlargement of the Union . #% Mr Bowis has told us about the Scottish example . #% Is that not the basic economic reality underlying your sums today , Commissioner ? #% The future participation of China in Galileo through substantial financial investment in the programme is most welcome . #% As an island nation , Ireland imports 80 % of its packaging material and has a very small indigenous recycling possibility ; we have a scattered population . #% I think this is something that could be expanded upon , throughout Europe , because schools offer a unique opportunity to educate this very venerable road user group . #% The report today must be supported as it is a real and positive step in the right direction . #% It is work which is carried out in difficult conditions , in an area where slackness and inefficiency in the implementation of budgets was traditional . #% However , our own actions rarely live up to our promises . #% I know I speak for the majority of my colleagues here as well . #% In conclusion I would like to reiterate the importance of the many roles of the Ombudsman and to wish him well in his duties . #% In this day and age , when there is so much EU regulation concerning the governance of financial investments , this is simply an intolerable and unacceptable situation . #% Hazardous substances that are carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic should not be used in cosmetics at all under the current proposal unless they are evaluated by a scientific committee and found acceptable . #% It would not be possible to catch and inject thousands of pigs every day for perhaps a week . #% It is just not acceptable to turn a blind eye to the others because of pressure from industry . #% I would ask you , Mr President , to make the strongest possible protest to the Council to ensure that my question and the other Members ' questions are restored and in fact replied to ; and to make it clear that neither this Council nor any other council is entitled to treat this House with such contempt . #% I congratulate Mr Watson and all concerned in putting together this report . #% We should recall that the accession negotiations are broken up into nearly 40 different chapters of talks , covering every ambit of social and economic activity that is carried out by the European Union . #% This is the strongest defence against relocation and in favour of strengthening the regions that need that help most . #% Where I come from in Northern Ireland the rural community is falling apart . #% Mr President , I have to depart a little bit from what I intended to say . #% We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic . #% I am not satisfied with what happened , but I also thank you for your letter , Mr President . #% Therefore , existing imbalances and discrepancies between core and peripheral regions should be counterbalanced by giving special stress to the setting up of information highways and facilities in the peripheral regions . #% I urge all colleagues to support this resolution . #% Finally , I wish to raise some areas where we need to consider the Commission 's proposals in more detail : efficiency , of course , is fundamental to ensure the better use of funds but if the efficiency reserve leads to more red tape and bureaucracy and an increased monitoring role for Commission staff , then I fear that all we will be doing is employing more private consultants in order to monitor those processes . #% Is it the Court of Justice ? #% This must not be used as a stick to beat the industry . #% Events of the past month have graphically illustrated what many have sought to highlight over the years about the reality of life in East Timor . #% Now it seems the government are moving from landfill to incineration and it is being presented as the green option . #% However , I believe that our common interests and concerns are best served by the European Union and the US Government working more closely together on a wide-ranging set of issues . #% Structural Funds are not a factor in these type of packages . #% There must be no unilateral approach . #% The `` no '' campaigners , starting from behind with nothing to lose and no one correcting the irrelevancies and , worse , the scare-mongering , beavered away . #% Secondly , the Commission maintains that it is not trying to harmonise tax rates , but how is it possible to separate the issue of tax base from the issue of tax rate ? #% No matter what happens at the UN climate conference in less than two weeks in Copenhagen , extreme weather conditions , like the flooding in Ireland , will become more frequent . #% We must take the long-term view when dealing with the disposal of packaging waste . #% Look at all the expertise that is involved in this job and I genuinely mean ` expertise ' of our assistants in our Groups , the staff of the committee and the Commission and the experts in the Council of Ministers . #% Amendment No 65 is necessary , as it ties this principle , which was endorsed by the Committee on the Environment 's Amendment No 10 , to the passport decision 2000/68/EEC , which amends Decision 93/623/EEC . #% 
Sticking-plaster politics do not work . #% The failures have been obvious in that we gave them too many tasks and we did not give them the resources to discharge these tasks . #% Yet this report itself accepts those same deficient procedures . #% For all of these reasons , and more importantly because these proposals would mean a 40 % reduction in the Irish white fish fleet and a loss of approximately 2000 jobs , I will be supporting the Varela report . #% Mr President , I should like to speak on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Members of the European Parliament , all our constituents and indeed the 99.9 % of the Irish people who would like to be associated with your remarks on the atrocity committed by the Irish Republican Army in Manchester . #% I am confident our people will give practical recognition to this fact when they vote next week on the Nice Treaty . #% I would invite the Commission , in conjunction with the Member State concerned , to find speedy and appropriate solutions to this problem . #% Secondly , we should encourage older people to remain at work longer if they so wish . #% I shall just deal very briefly with two other points concerning the whole working time directive . #% Mr President , I welcome the emphasis in this directive on the need to reduce discarded packaging and the increase in the targets for the recycling of packaging waste . #% Europe has been accused of making a mountain out of a molehill but the truth is that we are in a very difficult position . #% Israeli customs can be given a very long time , up to ten months , to reply to any queries and the import verification procedure can be totally unproductive . #% We can all , at times , excuse an occasional argument or even an accidental slap that might be given . #% As a people we need to develop a recycling mentality , which is now commonplace in all the European Union Member States . #% I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will , I hope , address this situation . #% In his report , Stephen has mentioned his concerns with regard to the common position ; I share some of those concerns . #% We must tread carefully on the matter of treaty reform for the simple reason that we have to guarantee that we can carry the support of the 340 million citizens in the EU for any such changes . #% It would appear that we have had some influence on him . #% I want to recognize the efforts of Karl von Wogau , his committee and , indeed , this Parliament for their dedication to this project over the years . #% Mr President , as a member of the Committee of Inquiry I voted for and I fully support the Committee of Inquiry 's findings and recommendations . #% If Europe does not supply the live cattle requirements , other countries will ; and surely we must have on our agenda the objective of maximizing the full potential of European agriculture . #% It is clear that a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is essential to the peace and stability of the entire region . #% I want to protest very strongly about this . #% While I , like Miss McIntosh , welcome increased competition in principle , the proposals currently being put forward by Council are badly thought out and ill-considered . #% I will therefore be supporting very strongly Amendment Nos 6 and 7 , even though the need to retrieve the name and address of the owner off the microchip is in some doubt , but I go for a standardisation of the chip , and only the chip not the tattoo . #% I would call on Mr Hughes and those who feel they want to vote for his amendment to take common sense into consideration . #% Some believe that this directive did not go far enough in this direction and that there is no real genuine consultation of the workforce . #% It is imperative that this level of funding be viewed as an absolute minimum . #% Jobs have a therapeutic value as well as an economic value . #% But , in the view of the Council at this moment in time , for the reasons I have stated , we do not see a role for the Council in triggering the Moscow mechanism . #% My report , with the support of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , raises the possibility of criminal activities in the use of these large banknotes and says that it requires further examination by the ECB . #% I accept that these are not merely crumbs on the table , they are significant slices of reform but we must grasp this opportunity to do more . #% Farming in Europe as evidenced by yesterday 's 15,000 farmer demonstration continues to be difficult . #% We have got to look seriously at what we owe in the way of solidarity to those who could qualify but clearly choose politically to stay out . #% In my own peripheral Objective 1 region , after a number of years of cohesion funding to my country , the Committee on Petitions of this Parliament recently acknowledged that Third World-standard unsafe water supply existed in communities such as Carraroe in my own constituency . #% As the largest combined aid donors , the EU Member States must fulfil their Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) commitments , improve aid effectiveness and coordination and strengthen their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 . #% The EU-based and the US-based multinationals participate in this exploitation to facilitate their super profits . #% I am not being nationalistic and saying that I want the Irish Embassy , but there is a certain amount of danger in this , particularly because it is geared towards the common foreign and security policy , which is not in the interest of the developing world or of the peoples that have been persecuted and exploited by Member States of this Union . #% Mr President , in relation to the labour-intensive industries the problem is competition from third countries , the cheap labour countries . #% It is important that proper and sufficient funding for compensation is made available for fishermen to convert to more selective and appropriate fishing gear . #% So , by all means , let us have parity of treatment , but let us understand the detriment suffered to date by those who , for years , have kept to the rules on pain of savage punishment . #% I support working towards reaching an agreement by the end of next year , but equally we must not and should not hurry possible fundamental reforms to existing treaties without due consideration and evaluation . #% He has said that he will not change his principles or conscience for political convenience , and I would not expect him to do that , but it is going to be impossible for him in his particular portfolio , given the challenges that will be before him . #% To me it means maintaining a reasonable balance between all sectors , including the profitability of each . #% Is it ECU 40m , ECU 24m or , as some of my colleagues believe , is it a smaller amount ? #% I am confident that once this is done the Irish people will vote for the Nice Treaty and embrace the fact that it is a necessary provision for the enlargement of the EU . #% Principle number two is to have institutions to do that . #% I am always fascinated by the reality , particularly in an Irish context , that sometimes people complain that Europe is too powerful and yet , when they have a problem and turn to Europe for help , they sometimes complain that Europe is not powerful enough . #% Madam President , I voted in favour of this report but extremely reluctantly . #% I believe that this House has the goodwill and determination to do just that . #% My government recently announced its intention to develop Northern Ireland as a centre of excellence in alternative energy . #% There was no conceivable argument against use or about the possible dangers that might occur that she did not invoke . #% Not only is the political situation becoming more unstable now in Iraq , but if we are not all collectively careful , the situation between Israel and Palestine could also deteriorate further . #% We did not agree on everything but we have had a lot of discussion on the very interesting issues contained in both these pieces of legislation . #% In particular I believe that representation within the European Commission should be based on a system of strict equality between small and large states . #% Establishing an EU coastguard would be a tangible way of doing this because it would tackle the real concerns of those we represent . #% I would now call on you , Mr President , to ask the British Government to release this woman from jail as a matter of urgency . #% Despite supporting many measures mentioned in the reports , such as increased role for the Parliament in the drawing up of the Code of Conduct for Commissioners and the enhanced role of the Parliament in international negotiations , I strongly disagree with the rapporteur 's assumption that ` the Treaty of Lisbon significantly deepens democracy in the EU , giving citizens of the Union , mainly through Parliament , a reinforced power of scrutiny of the Commission ' . #% The Commission is moving towards a system of accountability which will compare with the highest standards of the Member States . #% Commissioner Borg , this report and this Parliament are calling on you to consider a new Community initiative for this important sector of activity . #% This is as true for the coastal community of the Algarve in Portugal , which we visited a few weeks ago , as it is for traditional fishing communities on the island of Ireland . #% I want to ask you a number of questions relating to that . #% I welcome the fact that he has made unemployment and sound money his priorities . #% But you should watch and be fair , Mr President . #% I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Trakatellis , on the balance of this report and support the general call for more labelling and information for the consumer . #% The Commission is consulted and the Council must agree to the statute . #% 
By increasing energy efficiency measures alone by 2020 , we can reduce demand by over 20 % . #% But there is a role here , and we need to do more work on that as a unique parliamentary contribution to the playing field in which executives can deliver the goods . #% However , it is only right that the British Government should give categoric assurances that the highest possible safety standards will be met , because this issue is of huge concern to the people of Ireland and to many others . #% Yet , fellow MEPs , we are actually in business , the business of government and , crucially , of overseeing the spending of our constituents ' - our shareholders ' - money . #% I have raised this question because representations have been made to me by an organization at European level that is interested in the wool industry . #% While education remains a national competence , it is important that the EU give whatever support possible to educators and students , particularly in areas where new and innovative courses and qualifications are needed . #% Arising from what Mr Macartney raised concerning the Norwegian salmon deal and taking into account its serious implications right across the EU , could you explain to me how , as Members , we could raise that matter and sound the alarm in this House . #% If they are not practical and people are agreeing to them , then we will be giving hostages to fortune in this regard . #% Two weeks ago I spent the entire weekend and most of the week trying to negotiate for the handover of children who had been illegally abducted from the United Kingdom and taken to Italy . #% The guiding principle behind the directive is the extent of producers ' responsibility . #% Let us understand and fully bring into being the Europe of diversity in this reunited form . #% Instead it called on the US to adopt a strategy of constructive engagement with the Burmese authorities to maintain economic links with Burma while pushing for change . #% We need concrete action , not just repetitions of wish lists and words . #% Twenty Member States of the EU have coastlines . #% Thus , the Commission , by means of Directives 92/73 and 92/74 , created a legal framework allowing patients access to the products of their choice while providing precautions to ensure the quality and safety of the products . #% I realise that many small farms do not have the capacity to generate sufficient income for their owners because of scale and enterprise . #% This initiative is yet another clear example of the European Union seeking to bring forward proposals which will help to promote and increase the standard of education within the European Union and beyond . #% What I want to see in the Fifth Framework Programme , which did not happen in the Fourth in all areas , is attention to the implications for society of the research which these brains are working on . #% You yourself said that Monday was a historic occasion and that is true . #% Investigating the activities of the CIA or any secret services was never going to be a straightforward exercise . #% I urge that we do not desert this principle . #% Disaster risk reduction needs to be fully integrated into policies for development aid and humanitarian aid . #% The strictest possible criteria to reduce noise and emissions from aircraft engines can only be achieved however by using performance criteria and not design criteria which is commercially sponsored and fast-track in anti-competitive legislation . #% Both myself and Mr Poignant had one major preoccupation - to make sure that our reports were not only complementary , but more importantly that they were not contradictory . #% In particular I want to mention partnership , which is crucial because it involves civil society , environmental partners and NGOs working in close cooperation with all the partners . #% If I were to arrange a round table with the industry - with dealers and manufacturers - would you be willing to come along to it and discuss with them how we can find a way through the problem while , at the same time , resorting to competition instruments if we have to ? #% It would be very unfair to the civilian population of Iraq to allow questions of principle to prevent effective United Nations engagement with immediate needs . #% Regardless of the many other concerns we may have , BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved . #% Air transport is vital to the EU 's economy , accounting for up to 8 % of GDP , boosting productivity , attracting investment and encouraging tourism . #% Farmer privilege must be protected in this regard so as to protect the social and economic unit of the family farm throughout Europe . #% It is a fact that many small firms struggle because of late payments . #% I will not use the original Gaelic : ` Who shall speak for the lonely and the oppressed ? #% Provisions relating to the equine passport were modified through Decision 2000/68 but it subsequently ran into legal problems . #% Mr President , firstly , I want to draw attention to the absence of a number of issues in the social policy area . #% Mr President , faced with the government of Palestine being in the hands of the terrorist group Hamas and with its refusal to give up violence and to recognise Israel , it seems to me right and necessary that Israel should unilaterally make provision to define and defend its own borders . #% Combined heat and power is another very sensible measure which needs encouragement ; as do education and information throughout the EU , particularly to the target groups . #% I come from one of those islands , the island of Ireland that does not have a tunnel connecting the rest of Europe , or indeed a land bridge . #% At the same time it ill-behoves those anti-Europeans to dance on the grave of the Eastern European nations that are so anxious to join the European Union and to join us in this House . #% This proposal for a single work permit for nationals of non-EU countries was a missed opportunity to support decent working conditions where migrants are welcomed on the basis of equal treatment . #% That is perhaps why our situation is much better than the rest of the United Kingdom . #% The bottom line in relation to every aspect of the application of GMO technology , particularly in food production , is transparency , consumer information and accurate labelling . #% There should be proper codes of conduct and proper measures brought in to ensure that this kind of thing can not happen . #% It has sought to use the crisis arising from the atrocities of 11 September to shake out the industry to ensure that companies that may or may not have survived in the normal course of economic operations are forced to close down . #% President-in-Office , it is absolutely disgraceful that up to 700 000 people have been displaced from their homes , their houses and businesses completely destroyed . #% So , finally , I implore Parliament to act to condemn China for its role in underwriting the genocide of the Sudanese people . #% All Member States need to be singing from the same hymn sheet regarding common rules on security checks , searches , surveillance , prohibited items and security patrols , to name just a few . #% Then they can be properly liberated . #% However , that said , there is an opportunity for greater accountability of Europol . #% Madam President , we have all been deeply distressed by the illness of our colleague . #% It has also been a slap in the face to this House and those of us Members who have since 20 March tried in every way possible to resolve the problem and reduce the adverse impact of the BSE crisis . #% The Irish are saying here today that this is a great victory as the Spanish have been kept out ! #% I strongly believe that the European Union and the American government have mutually important roles to play in ending the violence in the region and restarting meaningful peace talks . #% This is something that must be taken into account in future WTO negotiations to ensure that EU producers are not put at a disadvantage . #% Finally , is the ECB in favour of abolishing these coins as a positive move for the future ? #% For example , tens of millions of migrant workers lead lives of shameful misery , with their children suffering the consequences of the horrific conditions under which they live . #% I would like to pay tribute to the support given by the chairman of the committee , Mr Newman . #% This historic process will have a positive impact for the actual cohesion of the European Union itself . #% Basically they will be looking at what is the best kind of system to enable them to make more gains in the next election . #% And yet Israel continues with impunity to maintain an air and sea blockade of its victim while continuing to squeeze the economic and political life out of Gaza , not to mention the killing of 200 Palestinians under the cover of the war on Lebanon . #% We should not , however , accept an increase in parliamentary powers at one level at the expense of our existing powers at another level . #% European leaders and European Union institutions can equally point to the fact that an internal market has been put in place , allowing free movement of goods , persons , services and capital , as well as the creation of a new single currency regime which commands so much influence within the European Union itself . #% Particular attention must be given to the needs of small , isolated coastal communities that rely exclusively on fish . #% The question of public service obligations is mentioned several times in the report . #% In relation to environmental protection , it is extremely important that the EU is given some sort of control . #% -- Mr President , while welcoming Commissioner Kinnock to the House I respectfully request a full explanation for Commissioner Prodi 's absence from the House this morning . #% Mr President , congratulations on a particularly focused summit as regards : the clarity of the objectives ; the analysis of the tasks needed to meet those objectives ; and the built-in progress-chasing system . #% 
Regarding market state responsibility , the EU is a large market and so it must improve control measures . #% The EU must establish a legal framework to enable action at other levels . #% If there are , could you tell us ( a ) what the problems are , and ( b ) which Member States are concerned ? #% So we need to have a worldwide environmental strategy with an impact assessment because the environment is worldwide . #% It is in the financial interests of the producer and the exporter that the animals arrive in tip-top condition . #% It aims to provide professional staff ready for the job , training , equipment and support for promoting healthier living in a healthier environment . #% However , this has been a long-standing and persistent problem for the developing world . #% author . - Madam President , I just want to comment on two matters raised in the debate so far . #% Both countries already have strict legislation on f-gases in place -- since the 1970s in the case of Denmark -- and they view it as a key measure in their policy mix to achieve their Kyoto climate change targets . #% Even the new CEO , Mr Norman Askew , is reported as saying that reprocessing is not the big part of the business it once was . #% I very strongly take the view that taxation issues should remain the preserve of the individual Member State governments . #% All accidents are tragic for individual people and , of course , we extend sympathy to the workers involved in the incident at Tokaimura , their families and the 300,000 local people who were subjected to intense fear and worry for several days . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council on his first day and hope his response to us today on the International Criminal Court is a reflection of his future cooperation with this House . #% They were then told , in 2003 and 2004 , that further adjustments had to be made to take account of the approaching World Trade Organization talks . #% This means , for the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna , that any plan or project not directly connected with , or necessary for the management of , the site , but which is likely to have a significant effect thereon -- either individually or in combination with other plans or projects -- shall be subject to appropriate assessment of its implications on the site . #% We salute all of those , on both sides and none , who helped to bring us to this day . #% It is also significant that the resolution before the United Nations in no way contradicts either existing EU or NATO policies . #% A successful outcome to these negotiations would mean saving the lives of millions of people in the world . #% This report endorses the aims and proposals set out by the G20 and the Basel Committee , to ensure banks hold sufficient amounts of capital of a suitable quality , and that they have the liquidity and stable funding necessary to withstand tough market conditions . #% Although the end-result of the Treaty negotiations represented a step forward , they did not go far enough . #% The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States . #% As the Commissioner is aware , the defence procurement market accounts for a large share of EU public procurement , estimated at about EUR 80 billion out of a combined Member State defence budget of EUR 170 billion , and that is why we are tabling this question today : defence procurement is still being awarded within mostly fragmented national markets . #% Mr President , the decision taken in this House today marks a great day for democracy and for the health of citizens throughout Europe . #% Such a declaration represents a misinterpretation of the outcome of conciliation , where there was a clear if implicit intention to allow stricter national measures on the basis of Article 95 ( 10 ) . #% Mr President , I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament , as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe . #% The medical histories of those who have died of H5N1 influenza to date are disturbingly similar to accounts of sufferers of the 1918-19 outbreak . #% Mr President , while the Greens fully support the efforts of the Commission to create a sustainable fisheries policy within the EU , we reject any attempt to simply transfer our problems to the developing world . #% Are we going to have it before next week ? #% The problem is when you ask them how to make the help really worthwhile , they are very slow to come forward with answers . #% I would like to thank the Commission and those staff in its directorates-general who have been patient in their explanations and have explained their rationale for preparing the preliminary draft budget . #% That is very important as well as for some specific areas such as information technology and others where there are very clear societal implications . #% In this lecture Dr Ratner warned his Irish listeners to continue to choose life and , among the many benefits this brings , avoid the demographic suicide of our European neighbours . #% It is also an assault on individual Member States ' policies . #% I am concerned that we are creating jobs which are low paid , part-time and creating a new underclass of the working poor who are existing on in-work benefits and family credit . #% The second thematic issue is children 's rights . #% In relation to paragraph 5 , I need guidance from the Commission . #% I look forward to very fruitful relations continuing between the EU and Saudi Arabia . #% It is an ideal area for the European Union . #% Those regions must be taken into consideration . #% We would like to see it extended to all categories , not just to some . #% Could you tell us what that response was and what was your initial reaction to the letter ? #% It is quite clear that this is at the behest of the arms industry . #% But we must seek to renew engagement between the Palestinians and the Israelis at all costs , and the European Union must play a central and pivotal role in this process . #% I come from Northern Ireland , part of the United Kingdom , and across the border , in the Republic of Ireland , the waste oil directive is interpreted differently . #% Perhaps the Commissioner might outline what those circumstances might be . #% So it is not an isolated concept , but part of an ongoing debate which will be pursued to some extent in Cancun next week . #% The report proposes a maximum budget increase of 2.3 % , keeping the increase below the EU rate of inflation . #% If this happens Europe will stagnate and eventually fall apart as Member States pursue their own individual aspirations , no longer having a common goal . #% In addition the Commission has produced a new programme to compensate farmers for some of their losses . #% Mr President , in September 1998 negotiations started between the EU and the ACP to agree the successor to the Lomé Convention . #% Numerous newspapers are being closed down daily and unfortunately the number of executions has increased significantly . #% Citizenship belongs to nation states . #% I would point out the importance to Parliament of Amendment No 29 and its counterpart in the Euratom programme , Amendment No 38 , which add criteria which can and should be taken into account , including activities to increase the role of women in research and to look at synergies with education . #% It must also apply for the multiannual financial framework . #% Up to 24 000 people in my country die prematurely each year due to this major hazard . #% In conclusion , the most important and effective weapon we have is the Association Agreement . #% For that reason , I wish to ask , firstly , as I have done already , for copies and , secondly , to ask , not necessarily now but perhaps to be advised at your discretion in writing , what procedures are open to a Member of the House to follow through . #% It is very clear that the problem of illegal immigration in Europe is one that needs to be tackled and I welcome the agreement reached by our leaders to intensify their coordinating efforts at sea and land borders to halt illegal immigration into the Union . #% Having to re-insure and re-register can be such hindrances . #% One further aspect where the British presidency conclusions agreed that further work was needed was better consideration of the changing role and functions of urban areas . #% But in the interim this should not be used as a reason for taking our foot off the accelerator on this important issue . #% It does not support the patenting of human gene sequences . #% Now it is being promoted by democratic states . #% Cattle travel long distances to go to agricultural shows , but these animals are well cared for by their owners . #% Indeed anybody who follows the Maltese media will know that it is the intention of the Maltese Government to hold a referendum on the issue . #% This repression is being stepped up because the regime fears the spread of revolution from the Middle East and North Africa . #% 
-- I should like to thank the Commissioner for his reply . #% That risk was heightened by the presence in two of those countries of very significant anti-EU minorities which , if they became majorities , could , under our present inadequate institutional arrangements , have stifled the very workings of the Communities . #% When the opportunity for peace arises , we must seize it as it passes . #% However , I can not agree that compliance with 3 out of 20 recommendations is progress . #% This is a core challenge that we look to you and to the Commission to resolve in terms of foreign policy . #% One regrettable point about the treaty is that the seat of the European Parliament has now been reinforced here . #% We have a moral obligation to create permanent peace and stability , tackle the problem of the warlords , improve human rights , especially , as other speakers have pointed out , women 's rights , and establish real democracy in Afghanistan . #% Mr President , I join with previous speakers in welcoming the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate . #% We need to guarantee the safety of our food chain from farm to table . #% Some of these things , in particular enlargement , will not be achieved without sacrifices by the people who are in the European Union at the present . #% He is , of course , outraged as we are in this House at what is happening there . #% They should also stop exploiting them . #% The computer games industry in my own region represents a third of the computer games world market . #% The vast majority of Parliament would have supported that position because it was a very fair and reasonable compromise . #% This is not a direct failure of the presidency but rather a failure of the collective will of the Council itself . #% Such producers should be rewarded for designing to reduce waste at competitive prices . #% I particularly liked the fact that he not only clearly identified human rights abuses , he also identified and praised efforts to end such abuses where these efforts are being made . #% I have to say I am relieved that Mr Clark and Mr Helmer find the report irrelevant , because I was afraid that there was so much praise for the report and that I must have done something wrong , if they also found it acceptable . #% Harmonisation of detergents legislation across the Community in this regulation will ensure a level playing field and is in line with the Lisbon proposals . #% I should like to mention some of the proposed amendments and my particular support for them . #% Parliament should be discussing those proposals when we next meet in Strasbourg in December , not next June . #% Members who have just returned from Palestine say that the situation there is absolutely appalling . #% The people of Europe want a budget that serves their interests and a budget that serves the political objectives of the European Union . #% Primary among these myths is the one about the draft Treaty leading to the creation of a so-called super-state . #% Indeed , it could be helpful before Göteborg - if it has not already done so - for the Irish `` no '' campaign as a whole to issue a single joint statement making it clear that their `` no '' campaign was not pushing for a `` no '' to enlargement . #% in writing . - I am disappointed by the voting on this resolution . #% The inquiry or investigation must be credible if we are to learn lessons from what happened . #% In my country alone , two million blind and partially-sighted people could benefit from this directive if the Council and the Commission accept our amendments . #% People in the Member States have to know the decisions that have been taken on their behalf which may not , in the long-term , be in their interests . #% I will not name them to spare people 's blushes . #% The net effect of this will be that Member States like Ireland can refuse to issue a driving licence to an applicant whose permit was restricted , suspended or withdrawn in another Member State . #% The proposal extends the scope of existing Directives 70/156/EEC and 80/1268 as regards the measurement of carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption . #% Sub-prime lending - that is lending to poorer people , those with an irregular income stream or difficult history of meeting loans - is projected to grow to EUR 4 billion in Ireland this year . #% Yet , even when we take in people from outside , we see in our accident and emergency departments , on a daily basis , people who in many respects are in Third World conditions , lying on trolleys in unacceptable conditions . #% Regrettably fraud occurs by falsifying certificates of origin . #% Water is a scarce and precious natural resource . #% Mr President , I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur and to say that I welcome this initiative , which clarifies the relationship between , on the one hand , state aid and , on the other hand , the provision by Member States of compensation for the cost of services of general economic interest . #% The Irish presidency has intensified the level of discussions on securing broader international support for the implementation of the Kyoto Accord . #% In another sense , both politically and scientifically , a huge amount has happened in the whole area of TSE , more particularly if you like , in relation to BSE . #% An internal coordinated approach has to begin in 1997 . #% In many ways over 60-plus years the UN has accomplished this vital mandate . #% Mr President , it is quite clear from the previous speeches that the situation in Zimbabwe is one of clear and total demoralisation amongst the people living there . #% Difference in religion , nationality and race . #% There has been no sudden calamitous increase in imports . #% A similar fate must not befall the groundwater directive . #% The Commission only adopted the proposals in May 2003 , and therefore we can not realistically expect the first grants to be available before late summer 2004 . #% Furthermore , the European Parliament must play an active role and strongly influence the revision of the rules already in the process of negotiations in the Basel Committee . #% It should have been reviewed well before now and incorporated into the Maastricht Treaty or gotten rid of totally . #% I know that the Commissioner will be most innovative in bringing forward new ideas for e-Learning and for education . #% While we have managed to reach consensus on issues such as pay and taxation , the question of employee consultation within firms has not yet been adequately explored . #% Does it matter ? #% The incumbent president of the European Energy Council , Michael Lowry , must explain the likely effects of the impending liberalization of gas markets in Europe . #% The MRL regulation of 1990 came into force in 1992 , and there was a derogation for many countries until 1 January 2000 . #% The renewal of the SAVE programme may be timely as the European Commission reports that the carbon dioxide target is being exceeded by 5 % . #% We must work together to ensure that their quality of life is dramatically improved , sooner rather than later . #% Mr President , again I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% I fully agree with Commissioner Reding on the need to reinforce and restructure programmes which are clearer to the citizens of an enlarged European Union . #% The Israeli government must end its blockade of Gaza and there must be an immediate resumption of aid to Palestine , and support for the government of national unity . #% That payment has to be made by the end of the year . #% The European Union can do some things . #% Finally , I wish to touch on two further points . #% Here no clear decision has been taken about what should be done : the site of a nuclear power station has not been returned to a state in which it can be used for other purposes , and we have a legacy of nuclear waste which will stay in the mountain for a long time . #% Applicant countries can now take solace from the fact that the EU has reformed its internal decision-making procedures so that the mechanics of the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner . #% I should like to respond to the Commissioner 's good wishes by wishing him and his colleagues , especially my Irish colleague , Commissioner Flynn and the President of Parliament a happy New Year . #% In this age , in Ireland and across the European Union , we have major health challenges to tackle : cardiovascular disease , neuropsychiatric disorders , cancer , digestive diseases , respiratory diseases , sense organ disorders , obesity and diabetes , to mention a few . #% Mr Piétrasanta has made an excellent analysis of the new tasks of the JRC as a technical reference body and a support mechanism for decision-making . #% 
I make the plea that we continue to support this . #% However , we are still very much at a disadvantage because many European Union countries appear to have a persistent record of failure to implement the Hague Convention . #% We need an assurance from both the Commission and the Council that this will not happen . #% We also need to look at concepts as yet unmentioned , such as hope and fear , creativity and expression , faith and spirituality . #% However , I am concerned and disappointed that the legal services of the institutions prevented elected MEPs from tabling more far-reaching amendments to this controversial piece of legislation . #% There is an urgent need to comprehensively address the multiple problems in the inshore fishing sector in the European Union . #% We are all citizens of democratic countries and , as far as I am aware , the vast majority of the citizens of each of our countries accepts the democratic nature of our national governments . #% None of us want to see any more death or grief in any region of the European Union , in particular there where the situation has been so tragic for so long . #% I believe a Member State has the right to reject such partnerships as not equal to heterosexual relationships . #% I think the labelling of food produce is something that is to be commended . #% Could I say before I sit down on an entirely different matter , but one related to the work of the Commission , that I would appeal to the Commissioner to ask our colleagues in the Commission to take steps to relax the rules and regulations governing state aid for the aviation industry , otherwise we are going to have to deal with tens of thousands of workers right across Europe who could well be unemployed in the not too distant future . #% We are one of the few Member States making massive provisions for future pensions . #% Canada has shown that it can actually wipe out its stocks without any help from anyone else . #% I hope he will forgive my forthrightness because this is an important question . #% If there is any possible likelihood of endangering public health by means of the implementation of any particular proposal , one must always veer on the side of caution , and I compliment the rapporteur on her report . #% The EU should be taking advantage of these benefits . #% The main problem with this approach is that it assumes that consumers first read the small print in such contracts and , even if they do , that they fully understand the implications of agreeing to forego the right to sue in their own courts and the differences in relation to costs incurred , legal systems , the choice of language used and so on . #% I also welcome the fact that the European Commission recognises that the best approach to take to ensure the successful implementation of these action goals is best agreed under a framework of the United Nations . #% However , we have seen the rate of recycling of packaging waste increase steadily from 93 000 tonnes in 1998 to just over 414 000 tonnes in 2003 . #% Madam President , a few weeks ago this Parliament called for an end to payments to live cattle . #% We still face a significant challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto protocol while , at the same time , promoting growth within our economies . #% I think it is symptomatic of the goodwill that has been shown towards the peace process in Northern Ireland . #% The good news also is that very recently the Council passed the Brussels II Convention . #% The proposal for this guarantee fund is both timely and progressive . #% The International Federation of the Red Cross has said that hundreds of thousands of people in Vietnam are likely to be short of food over the next nine months . #% It is flawed because we have moved away from the social dialogue and social partnership model where there was agreement between both sides of industry before a proposal came before this Parliament . #% I want to thank Mr Parish for his contribution , the thorough research and the very extensive report he has produced . #% It is quite clear that if something is not done now , at this stage , we are going to have a defence aspect to the EU . #% I should like to express my thanks to the Commissioner . #% If we are well , it is hopefully one of our most valued . #% However , animal welfare must of course also be a priority . #% Do you understand the income crisis that exists among the vast majority of our farmers across the Europe of 25 ? #% With the change in government in Germany , as you would know , Madam President , Germany 's nuclear policy will obviously be re-evaluated . #% It is difficult to recall a more challenging time for agriculture and the future of European farmers . #% They are the people who cadged money from abroad in the interests of breaking up the solidarity of the people of Europe and spent it to tell lies to the Irish people , while the Irish government - and , unfortunately , the opposition - were so complacent that we thought everybody would trust us . #% It is not a solution simply to put more traffic and freight on to our roads . #% I hope that tomorrow Parliament will rectify matters by overturning the rejection of the framework directive proposal by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . #% Civilians should be planting but they can not , because of the LRA threat , which is again backed by their own government . #% Madam President , thank you for your support on my right under Rule 108 . #% With the availability of employment outside agriculture and the advances made by the EU and Member States in reducing unemployment , there is now a serious threat to the sustainability of Europe 's traditional family farm . #% Any help is welcome but the current package will have to be substantially increased if it is to address the real losses to the people involved . #% I believe that the Commission has a very firm obligation to help out those countries . #% Mr President , I should also like to congratulate Mrs Jöns and Mr Hernández Mollar on their reports . #% Mr President , I very much welcome the President-in-Office of the Council and Ireland 's Foreign Minister to the European Parliament this morning and I thank him very much indeed for his report on the recent summit held in Dublin . #% There are obligations on financial institutions within the Union to substantially reduce the cost to consumers of transferring money from one euro-zone to the other . #% Currently there is a nuclear shipment from La Hague in France wandering around the planet between France and Japan . #% Perhaps we should review this at some stage in the near future and look at it anew to try to come up with a better solution . #% I would like to ask why a Commissioner would presume to speak in this manner in direct conflict with agreements that have already been signed and why she should presume to overstep subsidiarity in speaking on behalf of my country . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office if he is aware that recent public opinion polls in Austria indicate that over 80 % of Austrian citizens want to see the sanctions lifted . #% This report reaffirms that there will be a CAP post 2013 , that it should remain a common policy and that its budget should be at least maintained at current levels . #% The one-stop-shop schemes , which are at the heart of the package , will ultimately enable new rules for cross-border businesses and business-to-consumer services to be introduced . #% Regulated commercial trade in these species is allowed , however , such trade must not be detrimental to the survival of the species concerned . #% In the intervening period we have observed that other countries of the European Union , by going their separate ways , have in a rather roundabout way put the Single European Act into effect . #% If they do not meet the challenge I regret to say the alternative is too horrible to contemplate . #% Precarious work refers to a type of non-standard employment mainly characterised by little or no job security , low level of payment , lack of social protection rights , no protection against discrimination and a work environment without minimum safety and health standards . #% We are disappointed that Parliament 's proposals were not accepted in their entirety and that the Council decided to weaken the programme in the areas of equality , migrant rights and , crucially , in relation to the budget . #% However , that does not mean in any way actively encouraging lesser controls . #% There is an onus on the EU to recognise the plight of these people . #% I particularly welcome the fact that up to EUR 600 million will be made available for the fight against these diseases , of which the EU will contribute up to EUR 200 million . #% Smaller regional airports might have a hard time paying for new expensive measures , while airlines can not be asked to increase their ticket prices . #% The intolerance of the State and the courts of France against these Protestants should have been mentioned and condemned . #% The implementation of the Wye River Accord seems likely to proceed . #% Mr President , I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur . #% in writing . - This initiative by the Parliament is of special importance this year as it gives MEPs a chance to give their opinion on how the European Central Bank has reacted to the banking crisis . #% I do not mean that everything here is not justified - but tell us the story . #% We must work now towards achieving this objective via the structures of the United Nations . #% 
Irish farmers are already struggling to survive in an economic climate that has been made artificially difficult . #% This proposal has been discussed at a number of meetings of the Working Party on International Environment Issues , which is made up of scientific and management experts from Member States . #% This is important because so many people travel not only across Europe but across the world . #% By just saying ` no ' he is just burying his head in the sand . #% Given that it constitutes a huge proportion of their diet , fluoridated tap water that is not inspected , in which the levels of fluoride are not regularly checked , is a serious health risk to our neonates and infants in Ireland and in parts of the UK where they still fluoridate tap water . #% The fact that the Irish presidency has highlighted the drugs issue and that all of the Members who spoke here this morning , nearly the majority , considered drugs a priority issue to be tackled by this presidency in an effective way gives carte blanche to the Irish presidency to go ahead and deal with this issue as they see fit . #% We need to review the UN Conventions . #% One has to ask who rules society . #% The mutual recognition of travel documents is paramount to implementing EU policy on the admission of third country nationals . #% Therefore a trade and cooperation relationship develops as a result of an agreement , yet basic and clear breaches of human rights continue ; human rights clauses are ignored or not taken seriously , but there are no consequences . #% in writing . - Antibiotic resistance is a serious public health issue . #% We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo , and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention . #% So what are we going to do here ? #% All concerned -- manufacturers , national authorities , consumers -- hold a stake in the process and stand to benefit from the regulation . #% In recent weeks the Taoiseach of Ireland , Mr Bertie Ahern , announced the decision to create a major digital park . #% With the vote on this legislation we can as Parliament say we are legislating for all citizens for equal access and equal rights . #% The European Disability Forum and Parliament 's Disability Rights Intergroup have campaigned long and hard on this issue . #% Many colleagues today have spoken on the basis of experience in their own countries of how these issues are handled . #% Two million jobs were created in 2006 and unemployment fell from 8.4 % to 7.6 % . #% There is certainly a long and fraught road ahead , with different banking cultures and legal systems , but there can be no doubt about the bottom line : without provision for efficient cross-border clearing and settlement , the full benefit of an internal market for financial services can not be realised . #% Likewise , when it came to an opportunity there to join in condemning Zimbabwe for its mass forced evictions , the EU countries also avoided that issue . #% When it comes to environmental issues we need an international approach . #% Europe has such rich and varied produce and food , and we certainly need to protect that from trade liberalisation absolutists . #% Surely they must have some rights under EU law as EU citizens . #% Again , there has been a very massive growth in cross-border child pornography . #% I would like to point out that 66.9 % of those inquiries related to the European Commission -- so much for the Commission as guardian of the Treaties . #% Would the Council take appropriate and urgent action to ensure that the EU is involved in this mission and in the coordination of international food aid with other international organisations ? #% It is an extremely important issue because although it will not affect people in Ireland and the UK - because we do not eat horses - it will in other countries . #% If it is accurately reported then you must make it clear that it is your personal view and not the view of the Commission . #% On the one hand I feel considerable relief : it looks as though if Parliament concurs we have an agreement . #% I have to say to the Commission , and to producers in other Member States , that my producers have to date not seen any financial benefit from that which they have suffered . #% Now the Commission has proposed the removal of this provision in the revised regulation . #% There is justifiable criticism in the report of the use of violence , inhuman , cruel or degrading treatment or punishment inflicted on persons on remand by the security forces or the forces of law and order . #% Tonight he has made his best speech ever in the House . #% I have grave reservations about the idea of a common European embassy , given that in the past people fleeing persecution in certain countries were able to go into some embassies and seek asylum and get protection . #% As long as the agreements are designed in such a way as to do minimum damage to stocks which would not be utilised by the local fishermen in any case , it is reasonable for the Union to pass on the benefit of that , just as we pass the benefits of our own stocks in our own waters to the fishermen that get the licences to exploit them . #% That is enormously important for the credibility of what we do in that area and for our legitimacy with our citizens in what we do in that area . #% We all have a right to be proud to be in a position today to formally approve the Accession Treaties for ten countries seeking to join the European Union . #% Why is it that it recommends these results should be improved on ? #% Mr President , congratulations to the rapporteurs and Commissioner Papoutsis , who has not had an easy task here . #% The form of terrorism that now threatens the world has no boundaries , no identifiable location . #% The violence , murder , human suffering and instability in the Balkan regions , which have been taking place over the last 10 years , must now be put behind us . #% Rural development is not just an adjunct ; it is not just an add-on to compensate for falling numbers in agriculture , though it may well help to achieve that . #% This vote opens the door to further aggressive marketing on food products which is not backed up by sound scientific evidence . #% Prime Minister Barak has also vowed to end his reign of occupation of Southern Lebanon within a year . #% The real audience are our citizens and the countries of the European Union need to bring governments closer to the citizens . #% The largest part of the budget , of course , goes to fund the common agricultural policy , and this is an important community measure which must not be undermined . #% Ieng Sary and other Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to death in absentia in 1997 by the People 's Court , which was organised by the Vietnamese army occupying Cambodia at the time . #% I will deal with the easy questions first of all and then go on to the more difficult ones facing the summit . #% in writing . - This resolution calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure that Parliament is fully consulted on the organisation and arrangement of judicial training . #% We anticipate , if I understand correctly , a report in September on core activities . #% We must never again experience the traumatic events of recent months and the understandable consumer concern with regard to food safety . #% The Commission has an opportunity to plan for a programme of substantial food aid and it should do so without delay . #% However , if it provides for more transparency and accountability for the wider citizens of the European Union , then it is a positive development . #% Incidents such as the kidnapping in Southwest France by the ETA organisation are a test of the process . #% Finally , I totally support paragraphs 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 of the resolution . #% A cessation of violence was the fundamental precondition for the creation of a climate for political dialogue at Dayton . #% EU governments at Ghent supported the implementation of a common European arrest warrant , and our EU Justice Ministers are due to meet on 7 December 2001 to put in place the final terms governing the operation of this warrant . #% The IGC is now moving forward at a strong pace . #% In consumerism we are taught to be selfish . #% I think the word ` criminal ' has been mentioned here and there are those with criminal intent who have been involved in this . #% But clearly the European Commission should and must carry out an independent evaluation of all the environmental and public health risks , not just for Ireland and for all the UK but for all the people of Europe . #% He found common cause with other terrorist organisations throughout the world , including , in my country , the Provisional IRA , which has for years maintained fraternal relationships with its fellow murderers in the PLO . #% The ELDR Group looks forward to deepening our engagement and dialogue with him , and to a very productive period for the future . #% I will start with trade . #% The consumer has a right to know if farmed fish cause a disproportionate number of rapid alerts . #% 
While there are many excellent NGOs and pressure groups , which bring to our attention legitimate concerns on environmental matters and act as watchdogs holding the institutions to account on our behalf , I would urge caution in allowing any self-legitimising group to put an added burden on the institutions and clog up an already overburdened justice system . #% It is the one thing I do not miss having to do in this House now that we have some degree of normality in Northern Ireland . #% Now is the time to bring it to an end . #% Sadly , not for the first time in history , a war has been won , but the peace lost . #% I would also like to stress the importance of the EURATOM Treaty and a review or replacement of that Treaty as part of a common energy policy . #% Of course we are waiting anxiously for the decision of the Danish people . #% Consequently , a competitive market between air transport operators is necessary for Ireland 's economic competitiveness . #% No EIA was sought by the authorities on the massive Hilton Hotel project which is planned for the centre of Dublin , even though a revised EU directive adopted by the Environment Ministers in March said that such statements should be prepared for large-scale urban development projects . #% I firmly believe that our young people need to be protected from the scourge of smoking . #% I suggest to the Commission , as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement , to present a document , that explains the value of enlargement , not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense ; a document , like the Cecchini report before the Single Act , that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand , historic challenge facing Europe today . #% The amendment to Article 16 reinforces the definition of organic agricultural products . #% I do not support this criticism . #% We have a binding commitment to provide 1 % of our annual gross national product to meet our future public pension bills . #% As a fallback position , I support the proposal put forward by the PPEDE Group and others at committee stage and now resubmitted by the ALDE , namely to decouple Article 4 by requiring a study into the scientific basis of nutrient profiles before making a decision on their implementation . #% We have no difficulty with the `` polluter pays '' principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial , commercial and agricultural level . #% Difficult issues which this Irish government must face are attributed to Brussels bureaucracy or over-regulation , whilst any good news is claimed as an Irish ministerial achievement . #% They argue that human cloning is about the promotion of health . #% I congratulate President Barroso on his stance immediately after the vote in trying to encourage the governments to keep their nerve , to take a long-term vision , to use the same kind of ideology and the same kind of selfless desire to see an improvement for all the people of Europe that the founding fathers of the European Union showed when Europe rose from the ashes of the Second World War . #% Mr President , my group will be supporting a number of the compromise amendments that have been put forward . #% This will have particular benefits in my own country for Irish companies that deliver services electronically over the internet to consumers in other Member States . #% In these circumstances I think an investigation by the RUC would lack credibility . #% I welcome the common agreement from the Commission and Council on this matter and congratulate the rapporteur on his ability to garner the House . #% The emphasis should be on encouraging healthy lifestyles and healthy diets , not on censoring information , as is the case in relation to the socalled nutrient profiles in Article 4 of this proposal . #% The clear Council statement of December 8 needs to be driven forward with vigour and determination by you . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commissioner . #% Our job is always to pursue the unattainable goal , dragging our pragmatic colleagues with us as far as possible towards this goal . #% Mr President , the United Nations has been emasculated by two members of the Security Council on the issue of sanctions on Iraq . #% Having had the privilege to visit India on a number of occasions , I have been deeply impressed by the rate of economic development there over recent years and particularly in key 21st century industries such as information technology . #% It is reprehensible that young people in Lithuania coping with their emerging sexuality - which is a difficult enough time - must now do so in a climate of intolerance and fear . #% We need to replace it with a system of human solidarity , based on the values of democratic socialism . #% ... that there is talk of industrial action in the airports . #% It must be a step in a two -- state solution . #% In 2001 , Equitable Life lost a case in the UK that made it impose exit penalties on UK policyholders , though money for Irish policyholders was supposed to be ring-fenced and safe . #% I ask you particularly to look at the seventh EU framework programme and to deliver as best you can . #% I am not totally convinced that Commissioners Flynn and Bonino would agree with your very restrictive interpretation of this Court ruling . #% I am pleased too that you have defined for us ` modalities ' , it is a word strange to the English language , but of course , once you come to rules and numbers you are then beginning to be so clear that certain vested interests begin to take fright , so these negotiations will be difficult . #% From an Irish perspective , I believe that our cash changeover plan is moving very well . #% However , I wish to begin by saying that I absolutely deplore the way this House has been used this morning , in this debate , to fight national political elections . #% I would join in your words of caution from the experience in Northern Ireland . #% The disabled remain forgotten . #% I believe that if this directive is to be effective it must be implemented sooner rather than later . #% I believe that as far as international agreements are concerned , if there are significant amounts of money involved then Parliament is entitled , under Article 228 of the Maastricht Treaty , to full assent procedures . #% This is going to have a knock-on effect , even in countries such as Sweden which have a tradition of much more openness . #% The Commission is making a sincere effort to improve things , and the Greens will , as usual , support the Commission . #% It is important for us to ensure that our new Rules of Procedure are unambiguous , direct , and able to deal with the actual powers that we have and not try to create new ones . #% Will the office located in the small bedroom or the attic of the self-employed driver 's home be defined as his work station , and who will police and enforce the legislation ? #% I would like to ask the Commissioner a couple of questions about that . #% Berlin was interpreted by farmers as setting the agricultural agenda , without adjustment , to 2006 , and for this reason I believe the recent decision by the Heads of State was correct and restores to some degree of normality what was becoming a contentious issue for farmers . #% Mr Piétrasanta wanted to strengthen this resolution by saying that the gear should be obligatory rather than just simply encouraged . #% I regret that . #% Would they have invested if they had been aware of the undisclosed liabilities ? #% A further complication is that three DGs are involved in all of this : ENTR , SANCO and indeed AGRI . #% I agree with the resolution where it says : ' monitoring is a problem ' . #% It has been a marvellous presidency and I want to pay tribute to you personally , Mr Cook , for your courage in taking on very major issues . #% It is really important that we send out a signal from this House to ensure that they move speedily , because we are concerned at the failure of the Conference on Disarmament to meet the deadline for the conclusion of negotiations . #% You have actually got it wrong , Commissioner . #% I could go on and list a sad litany of how terrorist victims have been treated . #% We must also invest more in research and development policies . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate the rapporteur and say that it is not before time that we had this debate in Parliament ; but the more we talk , the less we appear to do on issues like this . #% I will be supporting paragraph 3 myself and will be indicating this to my Group , but there are those who have concerns about it . #% Nature abhors a vacuum and while , hopefully , we will not go back to condemning killings and burying the dead on the island of Ireland , undoubtedly street events will occur with increasing frequency if we do not hold elections . #% This House must send out a clear signal here today that we in the European Parliament , representing the citizens , want them to work in good faith . #% In conclusion , I would like to assure the Commissioner that he has the full support of Parliament in this important area of food safety . #% It is ironic on the eve of the millennium that we are discussing the working conditions of doctors who are working in what could only be described as Dickensian situations . #% Many of the asylum procedures in all our countries , particularly my own at the moment , seem to be taking a particularly long time . #% I would add that the regulations that Europe imposes on its farmers are very strict and much more difficult than those imposed on food produced outside the Union and that should be taken into account as well . #% 
DGXXIV 's new duties in this field were given further impetus yesterday when the Commission announced to the House their response to the BSE report . #% Finally , if this law or proposal was brought into any Member State or non-member country , Parliament would be the first to object and complain . #% If we reduce VAT we do not improve competitiveness since there is VAT on the imported as well as the home-produced goods . #% In Ireland , the sheep sector is melting down , with many farmers exiting the industry and therefore the imposition of these measures and costs on this sector at this time is unwelcome . #% On the one hand , people are saying that drugs should be liberalized and others are saying that we are refusing to deal with the issue . #% We can go back over previous resolutions and reports from this house concerning people with disabilities . #% The Roure report 's focus on both migrants and women is commendable and particularly relevant again to my home country . #% I am pleased that the rapporteur identifies the links between the issue of renewable energy sources and wider policy considerations . #% Mr President , when this Parliament last met it quite properly condemned the Nazi atrocities epitomised by Auschwitz . #% Here is one example : this is a Manchester United football shirt , coveted by many youngsters . #% This is a view which I believe is shared by the vast majority of the Irish people . #% We must now focus on other areas . #% The effect of TB in these countries is exacerbated by the fact that it is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads easily within confined spaces such as the squalid shanty towns so prevalent in many developing nations . #% Madam President , we spent a full day yesterday discussing the impact of BSE on public health and the serious consequences for our farmers , the food industry and employment , and we are , of course , also conscious of the consequences for our competitive position in world trade . #% The issue of the arms embargo to China is also one of major concern to those worried about the arms trade . #% As someone who focuses on agricultural and rural issues , I heartily welcome this initiative . #% For my Group , I could agree entirely with the words of Senator George Mitchell of the United States , who for almost three years also made a significant personal contribution to the search for peace in Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , ten speeches ago our committee chairman , Mr Wynn , said that everything that was important had been said . #% Furthermore , the amendment suggests that a unilateral European form of such a tax should be considered . #% Mr Gallagher has the same qualifications as he comes from the same sort of region and has the same sort of experience of the fishing industry . #% Certainly not the United Kingdom authorities - and it does not really matter whether it is a Conservative or Labour Government . #% I certainly hope this study and the proposals that come forward will , in conjunction with the fishermen , help the fishing industry , the fleet and those who actually work at sea . #% This is vital and must be retained . #% The directive , as some of the speakers have already said , needs to have binding targets in order for the Member States and the entire EU to achieve a significant increase in the share of renewable energies in the total energy market . #% The European Union guarantees freedom of expression and information in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights . #% Secondly , I wanted the Commission to indicate the share of investment per mode of transport in the framework of the Structural Funds programme period 2000 to 2006 . #% All foreign investment - we should remember - takes place through military-backed companies . #% Nevertheless , we will need this information so that we are able to extend some sort of assistance on a reasonable basis to the new countries of the Union where food production and agricultural production will increase by 50 per cent what we have in the Union today . #% In spite of what Mr Wynn has just said , this is a very human problem and one which needs to be addressed . #% Are you in favour of transparency , or are you in favour of avoiding working in the full glare of publicity , as this answer suggests ? #% As Commissioner Patten said , the agenda for the talks which are presently under way is a very serious European agenda and one that must be addressed before we can make progress . #% That is precisely why we believe in principle what we are doing today is a virtual abdication of parliamentary rights of review . #% We know that NATO and the US would not act and did not act . #% Commissioner , given the Commission 's desire to control its own propaganda -- as evidenced by Commissioner Wallström 's announcement recently of her proposal for a politically-controlled European news outlet , the EBS -- what confidence can exist that any attempt will be made at striking a balance in terms of the distribution of funding between organisations and individuals promoting a pro-Constitution stance and those who promote an anti-Constitution stance ? #% Mr President , as other colleagues have done this week , I too would like to draw the attention of the House to the unusual fact that we were not allowed to make one-minute speeches on Monday . #% The Finns harvest something in the order of 50 million cubic metres annually . #% I say to the critics : is it more important to feed the seals or to feed human beings ? #% I would also like to take this opportunity to say in my capacity as chairman of Parliament 's delegation for relations with South Africa , that I and my delegation colleagues have had extensive discussions with South African government ministers and representatives of NGOs concerning the European programme for reconstruction and development in South Africa . #% We have to put a real value on those who care at both the beginning and end of people 's lives . #% While I welcome the current Commission proposals concerning consumer access to justice , I am very disappointed to see that family access to justice , which is a human right , has not yet received the same level of attention . #% They are more interested in securing their position in the World Trade Organization than they are in securing the position in the World Bank to pursue the objectives of the Union . #% We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents . #% I could not look my constituents in the eye , some who will undoubtedly lose their jobs as a result of cuts in UK spending , and say that MEPs spent even more of their money wisely - and remember it is their money - by boosting the coffers of the EEAS , Europol and regulation of financial services . #% Rather , it is being used as a vehicle for rabid anti-Americanism , willing to trade in selective tittle-tattle while operating on a presumption of guilt by the CIA . #% They gave their lives knowing that it was a suicide mission but , for fellow mankind and for the greater good of their countrymen and countrywomen , they took that action and took that dangerous task on board . #% I hope you will bear that in mind and make sure it does not happen again . #% In light of the recent investigation by the Commission into the arrangements of Ryanair at Charleroi Airport , is it not now the case that regional airports in Europe are unsure how state aid rules are going to apply in the future and that this in itself is going to impinge on legitimate commercial decisions they would like to take , as well as on their future development ? #% Madam President , it is a matter of deepest concern and regret for us all that the prospects for a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has receded in recent months . #% Now that there is a larger swathe of territory not subject to Taliban control , we must visibly and urgently assess what needs to be done and be present on the ground . #% This is not the case for all countries in Europe at this time and that is why I welcome the efforts of the Finnish Government to pursue the adoption of a strategy on the Western Balkans at the forthcoming Helsinki Summit . #% Large numbers of our people are concerned over their personal safety or the safety of their families . #% The wording I have used is taken from Parliament 's own resolution of September 2000 on human cloning , where we called for a universal ban . #% I agree with what my colleague , Bernd Lange , has said . #% I am , however , somewhat concerned at the motivation underlying attempts by Israel to delay the investigation . #% They help keep older people in the communities where they have spent most of their lives , with the support of family , friends and services , and in familiar surroundings . #% I come back to the issue of the Irish Box . #% Mr President , I should like to convey to you a message I received when I was in New York last week . #% We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water . #% As we know , the vast majority of patients in hospitals are women . #% Mr President , I should like to call on the House to show its support and solidarity for the freedom of the press and for freedom of speech and to show its sympathy for the horrific death of an Irish journalist , Veronica Guerin , in Dublin last week . #% Also , in relation to the continued cycle , the idea of a period of rest on a journey that can continue indefinitely is completely unacceptable . #% We must today take the bold step of voting this law onto the statute book . #% Any possible evolution in this area will be by way of additional resources and additional assistance . #% Looking at the debates that took place at the special session of the UN Security Council 40 years ago in 1967 , after the start of the Six-Day War , it is interesting to see that the potential solution or plan considered was a guarantee of Israeli security and borders based on a withdrawal by Israeli forces from the Occupied Territories and a two-state solution . #% In particular , this issue , which is difficult and has been a very arduous task for all of us in the Legal Affairs Committee , has thrown up a number of conflicts , one of which most often mentioned within this House is the conflict between copyright-holders and consumers . #% There is nobody monitoring their health and safety . #% 
Mr President , this is a framework directive with ambitious targets for the protection and improvement of water quality , taking account of the polluter-pays principle . #% They are very influential with fans and they can have a hugely positive impact on getting people to stop that kind of behaviour . #% There is no place for dissidence at this critical time and those found in breach of the regulations should , in my view , be severely censured . #% We , as a democratically elected forum , must use our moral authority to help the people of Colombia in their struggle to bring to an end the conflict in their country . #% Because the balance of payments constraint and problems will cease to exist . #% Generally we have post-tax prices advertised . #% The international difficulties which surrounded the war in Iraq were many , but I believe that in the context of its presidency of the European Union the Greek Government dealt with this difficult political matter as even-handedly as possible . #% We do not know what the exact result of a vaccine will be on the human body when trying to prevent the spread of avian flu , and will not know until such time as we allow our scientific experts to act and entrust this matter to people who know what they are talking about . #% The key to achieving our ambitions in the area of the recycling and recovery of packaging waste is setting attainable targets based on realistic expectations . #% The failure of the PPE-DE resolution unequivocally to condemn the illegal activity of members of the Israeli defence forces and demand their prosecution is morally and politically indefensible . #% Mr President , I hope that Members will not be deluded by the rapporteur 's assertion that the common position respects this House . #% I am sorry that view has developed as it undermines the work of a well-intentioned committee and misses the point as regards what we are trying to achieve . #% The committee would like the Commission to tell us in particular what progress has been made on the infringement proceedings launched on 4 April 2006 and what future steps are planned in this area . #% It may be the last opportunity I have to do this in this House . #% On tax deepening , we believe the Commission has opted for an unnecessarily complex formula . #% Furthermore , the Legal Affairs Committee ignored the advice of Parliament 's legal services that the legal base for this directive was correct . #% An important European value that we all , whether lay or religious , purport to share is that any experimentation on a human being should only be for their exclusive and direct benefit . #% I also agree that more research is required to take account of the exposure of children to risks from sources other than toys . #% Events in Belgium have focused international attention on the many loopholes which exist , both nationally and internationally , in our laws . #% For example , it would be almost impossible to treat a pig-breeding and fattening unit of , say , 5 0-10 000 pigs in any other way than in feed and drinking water . #% The argument about fear of a World Trade Organisation challenge is completely unfounded . #% The bottom line is that consumers need to know what redress they can expect if they are the victims of sharp practice or rip-offs , while business needs to operate in a competitive world . #% The realities of agriculture and the low farm incomes in both Europe and the developing world are central to this debate and , lest we also forget , one of the crucial problems - and the Commission identified it in its position paper - is that rising commodity prices and rising food prices do not translate into higher farm incomes . #% Mr President , it is not only a political responsibility but a moral responsibility that the European Union has to help those in straits outside its boundaries as equally as they can . #% As indicated in my reply , I can not speak for the Council on this matter . #% Mr van Velzen touched on the fact that a lot of SMEs shut down within a year of being set up . #% The European Union and all the world 's major countries should come together to create that kind of world and to take the necessary steps to prevent war . #% However , we must question further tightening beyond the common position and whether it will bring any significant additional environmental benefits . #% It is a good working document and we have a good basis to start working , so I congratulate the Commission as well . #% Computer equipment is sold worldwide and the educative , awareness-raising aspects of seeing the Energy Star logo on computers is worthwhile . #% As you leave this House to go to the various capitals and form the Commission , we have a number of priorities we would like to see in respect of balance . #% We should decide in conciliation and not let the ECJ decide , even though I would be very optimistic that my personal opinion will come out of the ECJ . #% Clearly , a multi-faceted approach is needed if we are to guarantee that the roots of international terrorism are tackled head-on . #% I visited the Thai-Burmese border two weeks ago for six days . #% I have no difficulty if three-fifths or three-sixths or three-sevenths of the Parliament decide to terminate such offices , but if the Conference of Presidents does so it is absolutely crazy . #% Mr President , Ireland is committed to working with all Member States and international bodies to achieve higher standards in animal welfare . #% A balance must be struck between EU textile protectionism , which costs an extra EUR 270 per year for each four-person household , and complete market distortion . #% Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree that fisheries are important to peripheral maritime areas throughout the Union where there is no alternative source of employment ? #% The SDLP - the party led by John Hume who is in this Parliament - has given its support for the first time in the history of Northern Ireland to the police service there and they should be congratulated for that . #% We are in a situation in Europe at the moment where we are pouring millions of euros into the agricultural industry , yet the farmers have never been worse off in their lives . #% At every critical point during that period , he has caused the Commission to offer to this House solutions that , had they been offered at the outset of each stage , might have worked . #% Mr President , you will find that it is a very real point of order . #% Others might give it another name , but it gets us to where we want to be at this point . #% We can not allow that to happen as a Parliament and we must call for your support right across the political groups for this amendment . #% We must all ensure that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars at the design stage . #% Indeed , most MEPs in this House come to this House with an embarrassingly low mandate . #% He says it will only apply to temporary cross-border provision of services . #% Many people , especially old people , were confused as to the worth of the new Irish coins and notes at that time and were taken in by unscrupulous dealers . #% The tragedy of people cut up in civil wars , which is the main focus obviously of Mr Wiebenga 's report , is only one of the issues we are facing . #% This is absolutely bizarre and I would like you to inquire into this , Mr President . #% This right needs to be balanced against an individuals right to access to information and , furthermore , sanctions should only be targeted at the larger commercial exploiters of copyright material . #% That peace has been shattered by renewed acts of terror intended to wreck the peace process . #% While this is in line with the Treaty , we do not live in a vacuum : outside influences and policies have an impact on Europe 's internal checks and balances . #% In my opinion , the Swedish Presidency did not seem to have the facility to have any meaningful negotiations on the matter . #% I am happy to say that it is not the only consideration , because lots of us use the post and would like it to be delivered each day rather than just once a week . #% Thirdly , the whole area of sustainability , with people who are already at work given protection and certain support now to make sure that they do not lose their jobs and then have to go through the cycle of retraining and upskilling in another year or two 's time to get another job ; to maintain the existing jobs that are there . #% The fact is that under the Brussels II Convention the decisions made in the court in the country where the child normally lives can be implemented in the country where the abducted child is being held . #% The promotion of entrepreneurship will allow citizens themselves to play a real part in our economic recovery . #% People have a duty to address the realities of life and one of those realities is that drugs are available and that young people and vulnerable people are being exploited by this . #% The Treaty is certainly a good deal for countries of Central and Eastern Europe , but equally for existing Member States of the Union . #% As the rapporteur has pointed out , there is a suggestion that exposure to electromagnetic fields could lead to an increase in occurrences of cancer and other serious threats to human health . #% I will undertake to raise with the Commission the comments made by the honourable Member . #% DG ENVI 's strategy has been mainly restricted to knowledge-gathering and fails to address some key problematic sectors such as - unsurprisingly - agriculture , forestry , transport and many others . #% I am confident that the measures outlined above , and others , can contribute significantly to sustainable fishing and ultimately lead to sustainable fisheries . #% I am sorry to say I do not find your answer quite sufficient in relation to the export refunds . #% I believe that Afghanistan is only the tip of the iceberg as far as the United States is concerned . #% 
We fix the guide price and then base compensation on the average market price . #% You will find that we will respond generously and effectively and helpfully . #% Mr President , I participated fully in the drafting of this joint motion for a resolution on antibiotics in animal feed . #% I would like here and now to dispel the myth that this mission will be French dominated . #% It is not enough to introduce it in one Member State alone . #% Since 1999 , countries that obey the rules have been honouring Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1447/1999 , which required proportional , effective and dissuasive penalties with regard to serious infringements of the common fisheries policy . #% I deplore the decision of the EPP , ELDR and the UEN to vote against the PES resolution to set up a European Monitoring Centre for Industrial Change . #% I also believe that the Commission must not shy away from playing its role as a full partner merely because some Member States are claiming the monopoly on subsidiarity . #% Why are they just looking at the industry 's tests and just going back over them ? #% I note that it is estimated that , in those Member States where this is done , around EUR 5 billion a year is raised , in terms of added value , by promoting such geographical indications . #% Martin Luther King said : ` Peace requires not only the absence of violence but also the presence of justice ' . #% This will allow further innovation and development of alternative technologies with regard to air conditioning systems . #% I am very pleased to hear the President-in-Office 's positive remarks in that regard . #% It is a very simplistic response which amounts to little more than punishing the powerless for the seeming sins of the powerful . #% Mr President , ever since the Tampere Summit of European Union leaders in 1999 , the issue of formulating common policies in Europe to tackle illegal immigration has been high on the agenda of our institutions . #% I am afraid that it could have a cascade effect and certainly will damage consumer confidence within Europe , irrespective of its actual trade effect . #% Liability looked as though it would be a big problem but , fortunately , it was overcome . #% Since it is clear that the long-term goal set out by the Fifth Environment Action Programme would not be attained easily , the Commission has rightly decided on a step by step approach setting out so - called interim environmental targets by the year 2010 . #% It is often forgotten , that the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution . #% I welcome in particular the confirmation by the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers yesterday in Brussels of the full participation of the new Member States in shaping the Treaty that will follow the Convention . #% These are just some of the conditions that a steady accumulation of fluoride has inflicted on the Irish people . #% I note with some surprise that the Republic of Ireland , although a long-established EU Member State , has also been permitted to defer full compliance until the beginning of 2012 . #% Other amendments seek to ensure that the granting of a patent does not allow monopoly or abuse of a dominant position . #% We have a right - in fact a duty - of participation . #% So I hope we can raise this at the meeting of the Bureau later today . #% I believe this clarifies where different countries stand . #% Naturally , Parliament put forward its own proposals to support the right of doctors in training to be covered by this directive after a period of 4 years . #% I regret that it is not going to be easy . #% I know that these sorts of acts do not only happen on one side of the community , unfortunately . #% But as well as betraying the EU/EOM and ordinary Pakistanis , you are also betraying the ideals of your own Presidency . #% Under the new rules , all Member States will be able to avail of such EU funding to improve the conditions of marginalised households previously unavailable to Member States which joined since 2004 . #% We should remember that this initiative is part of a package which aims to stimulate failing European economies . #% Let us not underestimate the amount of work which must be completed before enlargement becomes a working success . #% We are dealing with lives here and human lives must always be protected . #% Have we got the right methods and mechanisms in place to resolve it ? #% This core integrity is more important than massaging the nationalist egos of recalcitrant Member States who have been , and will continue to be , a barrier to progress . #% As everybody knows it received massive backing by all the people on the island of Ireland only last week . #% I for one believe that the retention of staging posts is of key importance in this regard , and I am certainly not alone in this view . #% The impact of this directive will not be uniform across all sectors of the economy and therefore it will negatively impact on certain sectors , in particular those areas that are more heavily dependent on transport . #% The other point I want to bring into this is the lack of dialogue between the different institutions and the operators themselves . #% For certain people in certain sections of society , there is a danger in any country . #% Mr President , I certainly join in welcoming this announcement . #% I would commend this report to the House and ask it to support it . #% Mr President , I welcome the rapporteur 's emphasis on sustainable forest industries which are indeed of primary importance to the European Union . #% When framing legislation we have an obligation to ensure that legislation is effective , that it can be easily enforced and that it does not impose an onerous burden on employees or enterprises . #% I want to draw Members ' attention to the fact that I will be distributing that article today for their information . #% The recent conflagration in the Balkans highlights the latent potential for destruction . #% I reject , therefore , the views of those today who argue that this debate is a late attempt to derail the abolition of duty-free . #% These are , in my view , the real weapons of mass destruction in the world today . #% Mr President , Commissioner , I was honoured to be asked by Commissioner Patten to lead the EU electoral observation mission to Sri Lanka . #% When a new President was brought in , Israel said it could not deal with him , it could not negotiate with him and they were backed up all the time by the Americans and by certain Member States of the European Union . #% In this regard , one suggestion is that we contemplate the establishment of a political and security committee and military committee . #% I have one negative point to say to Chancellor Schroeder . #% Mr President , I would just like to say for clarification that I wanted Council to set a timetable . #% I agree with many of the proposed amendments and with the overall direction , but I have some concerns . #% However , recent scientific analysis has shown that , in spite of the satisfactory utilisation rates in this segment , coastal demersal resources have plummeted and have forced the small-scale and industrial fleet to fish in neighbouring countries . #% It can not continue . #% Workers in the industry expect this , and the public most certainly does . #% Thank you , President-in-Office , for your comprehensive reply to the first part of my question . #% I just wanted to emphasize that point . #% I also welcome the establishment of the forum on cybercrime . #% The debate we have here today , which is very welcome , has been part of a long , difficult technical process . #% Thankfully , we have now come to the point where we can afford to cast our attention towards more ambitious goals . #% That would make it much easier , because otherwise it is easy for people to see how each Member voted . #% As drugs are part of the international terrorism network can you tell us what precisely you agreed at the G7 conference ? #% The Seville European Council is important for the many reasons outlined in our resolutions here today . #% 
What we want to hear from the President-in-Office to day are specific measures for a common European strategy to save the future generation from dying from the effects of drug abuse . #% I am talking about a price in terms of money , in terms of trade and in terms of arms supplies . #% For the first time the European regulatory framework for authentication services will be established and the legal recognition of electronic signatures ensured . #% I will continue to urge that public representatives be paid an average skilled worker 's wage and to advocate the elimination of unnecessary costs , perks , benefits and other privileges . #% In the case of Greece and of both parts of the island of Ireland there are obvious geographical obstacles to full participation in a single rail market . #% With regard to the role of national governments , these and other reforms are badly needed . #% If we are not willing to give respect to ourselves within this Chamber , if we are not willing to work within the rules and the laws as set down by our own Rules of Procedure , invoking our rights and powers under the various treaties and under the new constitution -- if it is adopted -- then no one outside this House will have respect for us . #% The level of racism in our society is terrifying . #% These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention . #% We and others have brought it down to 22 000 because of democracy and human rights and the sort of financial instruments which the Union has approved . #% Mr President , on behalf of my political group , I very much welcome the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Burundi and in particular acknowledge the cross-party support for the condemnation of the brutal murder of Archbishop Courtney on 29 December 2003 . #% What we bring forward from the Lisbon process and the Lisbon summit , most importantly of all , is access to education , training , learning and knowledge . #% They have each in their own way showed enormous courage . #% The nuclear five blocked all agreement on even small moves on nuclear disarmament at the NPT Treaty Prepcom meeting in Geneva . #% We should not be singling out aviation and ignoring shipping and the considerably greater impact from increasing road transport and car usage . #% Moreover , an adequate contribution from different economic sectors , broken down into industrial , household and agricultural sectors , must ensure that this policy is implemented . #% The ball is now in the Commission 's court . #% Some Member States have agreed a text on the Constitution for the future of Europe and it is ultimately up to them to deliver on their agreement , to make sure they convince their people . #% Yet , because it is so expensive it is not growing at all , any more than it is in western Europe . #% I am particularly pleased that there will be a lighter disclosure regime for rights issues . #% Strong fluorinated greenhouse gases legislation is long overdue to rectify the past and protect our climate into the future . #% There is a lot of unhappiness here about the Commission declaration . #% Enough about ` stupid ' energy . #% We have to take seriously the claims that a proper audit into the firms was not carried out . #% In the long and complex history of Anglo-Irish relations and relations on the island of Ireland , and especially the violent history of the past 25 years in Northern Ireland , one lesson is beyond any possible doubt : that violence from whatever source postpones the day of reconciliation . #% The question really is : can we best advance our influence in the sphere of human rights by continuing to conduct the sort of relations we have with Turkey as we do at present and the judgment has been that we can . #% If Sinn Féin / IRA succeed in denying criminal justice to this family , then I endorse the call that the EU should help fund an action so that the killers and conspirators can be pursued at least through the civil courts . #% You will not force Member States and companies into complying with the law if there are no adequate sanctions in place . #% Following on from the President-in-Office 's two responses to my colleagues , Mr Hyland and Mr David Martin , I would like to ask whether you have any proposals with regard to more focused coordination between the regional funds and the rural development funds as a way of ensuring that people in rural areas who suffer because of a drop in income can gain off-farm income through job creation and so on ? #% Clearly Father Shay Cullen 's campaign against this vicious tourism , which Parliament has condemned many times , is causing considerable worry to the powerful and corrupt circle in the city in which he is campaigning . #% From this shabby performance we have more than enough evidence that standards of environmental controls are far from good enough and I hope today 's adoption of the MAATEN report leads to further pressure for improvement . #% I agree fully with Mr Herman . #% It is not appropriate for a polity like the EU , with its proper and legitimate aspiration to be a world force , to be benignly neutral in the UN mode . #% Decisions will have to be taken at some stage in the short term , not in the long term , and such decisions will subsequently need to be properly implemented . #% As both the Gargani and Niebler amendments were defeated , the next amendment ( Committee ) was passed as I feared . #% In this regard , I would like in particular to welcome and support the proposal for the dissemination and communication of information through innovative libraries and new technologies . #% This is not going to be an easy task , but it must be vigorously pursued as a military option . #% Certainly the Commission , Parliament and Member States ' governments have all worked closely together to ensure that the Stockholm Summit will be a success . #% With 3,000 miles of coastline around Ireland , the possibility of illicit drug smuggling is always present . #% On competition policy , the Liberal Group believes the public service providers must continue to be subject to competition policy through Article 90 . #% I hope that this month , given the weight of opinion expressed here today , this will now be listened to . #% I want to welcome the Swedish Presidency 's presentation here this afternoon as one that appears to be extremely constructive and pragmatic . #% The economic crisis has serious consequences for women , who are at greater risk of poverty than men . #% This is one of those rare occasions when cynical politicians get outraged . #% One of the best ways of addressing this is by looking at the advertising industry . #% More importantly , thank you for addressing us in a language that was devoid of Eurospeak . #% As we face a difficult debate on the future financing of the Union and Agenda 2000 , we must not lapse into an arid , sectional and narrow debate on budgetary policy , to the exclusion of the wider vision . #% They are worried about the content of the programmes their children are watching , particularly the level of violence and unsuitable programmes . #% But it is not all good . #% Indeed , one is tempted to say that such is the EU 's apparent awe of China that it avoided an opportunity during the year to sponsor a critical motion in the United Nations . #% It is important that Member States can decide to establish a well-defined system of prior authorisation for reimbursement of costs of hospital or specialised care . #% Ireland has consistently emphasized the importance of the semi-integration of the ACP countries into the world economy and the compatibility of new trade arrangements with the World Trade Organization . #% We can all recall that the Kyoto Accord sets down a timetable for the reduction in the level of the use of greenhouse gases . #% Quite frankly , at this stage most businesses think that time is running out for Lisbon , if indeed it has not already run out . #% Anyone who argues the opposite is playing to the gallery of populism , rather than dealing with substance and fact . #% The report covers all aspects of the CFP , including conservation and management of resources , structural policy , external fisheries policy , market policy and monitoring and control . #% He is a very distinguished Danish poet , one of your own countrymen , Mr President , Thorkild Bjørnvig , who is winning the prize for his translations of Rilke from German into Danish , which although not a minority language is less spoken than some of the other languages in the Community . #% On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation can not and will not be provided . #% For far too long the Palestinian people have been denied their legitimate rights . #% I encourage the Council , the Commission and indeed the UN to act and take this resolution seriously . #% As a mother , I believe that robbing children of their innocence is a crime . #% I want to mention the following : French training of security forces and death squads in Rwanda ; the sale of arms by Belgians to Rwanda ; the training of Indonesian troops by the British ; German submachine-guns used in a prison massacre in Brazil ; Hawk jets sent to the Indonesians so they can persecute the people of East Timor ; UK arms sales to places such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia ; torture weapons being sold to countries so that they can inflict human rights abuses on people around the world . #% That involves a massive surrender of national power , compounded in its folly by the lack of real control over what the Commission then does in our name . #% What we must be careful of in the field of taxation is not taking into account the needs of certain Member States . #% If they are practical and realistic , then it will be possible to insist on delivery from all Member States , even those that have difficulties in reaching targets in this area . #% It is ironic that at a time when the European Union and this Parliament are striving to diminish smoking because of its serious health consequences , in another area we are trying to allow people to freely damage their own health with drugs that have been proved to damage health and create other problems . #% 
One of the key legislative organs is the European Commission , which has the power to initiate the enactment of directives and regulations . #% We are all very pleased at the success of Ireland 's presidency . #% If your ruling is that I can not give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservations . #% This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enabling guideline , can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU . #% As the new Integrated Programme is open to some third countries ( Iceland , Liechtenstein , Norway , Bulgaria , Romania , Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Serbia and Montenegro , Switzerland ) , it has a huge potential for contributing to intercultural understanding . #% Mr President , I should like to start with a little irreverence which only your Irish colleagues can take the liberty of doing . #% What resources will be made available for widespread public consultations on key ethical issues ? #% Mr President , as Chairman of the College of Quaestors , I have been asked to help arrange transport to Parliament tomorrow for assistants coming from Brussels . #% The results will be greater congestion and environmental degradation , more accidents and a loss of competitiveness of European industry , which must rely , for the management of its supply chains , on cost-efficient transportation . #% The EU 's lust for endless enlargement is driven by a craving for ego-building world status , which goes hand in hand with the drive for super-statehood through the rejected Constitution . #% In particular when we speak about the free movement of workers , as was pointed out in the two previous debates on Lisbon and on the Lipietz report , the free movement of workers is not just about internal barriers . #% This not only impinges on the credibility of our economic rules , but it leads to a broader problem of selling a focused message to the citizens of Europe about the positive work of the European Union itself . #% I would like to turn now to Mr Linkohr . #% I would be the first to agree that we need more debate on and refinement of the proposed legislation . #% Too often we hear spokesmen from the various political groups talking purely about the idea of a competitive economy and ignoring the balance we need to ensure within the European Union in terms of modernising and deepening the social model that we have in Europe . #% EU accession to the ECHR improves the Union 's standing when calling on third countries to abide by its human rights standards and extends to people in the EU the same level of protection against Union action that they enjoy with regard to Member State action . #% Finally , I would like to draw colleagues ' attention to the initiative of a number of Member States along the Atlantic north-west to establish particularly sensitive sea areas . #% Integration has succeeded in overcoming age-old differences between European countries . #% One in 12 EU citizens is unemployed today . #% Indeed , such a directive is needed because the current European Union legislation does not provide for a Community mechanism governing the use of oil stocks . #% Furthermore , what would or should be the role of the EU if a vital interest such as our energy supplies or our telecommunications links were threatened ? #% The best approach is the multi-track approach , taking the best from each individual part . #% In particular the relationship between the European Parliament and the European Commission must be hardworking and harmonious , so as to ensure that key elements of our EU legislative requirements are enacted in as an effective a manner as possible . #% Prior to the birth of the EEC in 1957 , Europe was bedevilled by hatred and division . #% It is not an issue that we should link with other matters because that merely diverts attention away from where the real work can be done . #% Parliament has a duty to support what the Environment Committee is proposing . #% Therefore health and safety should be our foremost concern . #% I am saddened that I stand here tonight and we do not have a resolution . #% Mr President , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice . #% Indeed , Norway has complained particularly about the Arctic fishing grounds being affected . #% In this regard , proper consultation of the fishing and aquaculture industries is not only desirable , but absolutely necessary and essential so as to avoid any detrimental consequences for the fishing industry that may be caused by levels not scientifically justified . #% Malta 's other important cash income activity is tourism , which also depends on EU markets for its survival . #% Mr President , at exactly this time last year you will recall that there was worldwide condemnation of the French nuclear tests and this Parliament told President Chirac in no uncertain terms here in this hemicycle what we thought of his government 's actions . #% We are already unpopular . #% Has it not in fact been asked by the Court to make such a submission ? #% We must be mindful , however , that the aim of this legislation is also to improve the competitiveness of the chemical industry , one that is very important in my own country and creates quite a number of jobs directly and indirectly . #% There , economic interests have overtaken political principle and if we fail to act as one , particularly where principle is involved , then we will have no meaningful role in the geopolitical world . #% So , Madam President , can we invite the Commission and indeed the Council to express themselves in this House earlier in the week , so that we can treat this properly ? #% If politics is the art of the possible let us now challenge ourselves to do better , to respond in a more positive and caring way to the helpless pleas of those destined to die of AIDS , disease and hunger . #% Equally , the transportation of nuclear materials via the Irish Sea sends shivers down the spine of many people living in Ireland . #% However , as in many other areas , the reason that contracts have been awarded to countries like Korea is surely because of the conditions that apply : for example workers in such countries get very low wages , working conditions and safety measures are very poor and unsatisfactory , because the health and safety of workers is not a priority . #% In conclusion , when it comes to addressing the challenges of EU enlargement , certainty , determination and commitment are all words that can be used to sum up the opinions of the vast majority of the people living in Europe as well as those of legislators working on these important issues within the different EU institutions . #% It seems that it has basically decided to participate in the overfishing . #% It requires the good will and the support of many from both the smaller and larger Member States within the European Union . #% Energy taxes need to be carefully thought about . #% However , this is a crime without borders , and as such , it is European legislation as much as national laws that will truly put an end to slavery in Europe . #% The directive also applies the principle of internalisation of external costs . #% If that is your way , it is a political mistake for the Council and for Europe . #% Let me be clear that we are not talking about micro-management , as a colleague has already said , or individual programmes and projects . #% There were reasons for imposing such stringent measures in the first place . #% It must not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank . #% A CO2 tax applied to all polluters should be used to reduce other taxes and applied equally to all sectors , for example agriculture and smelting . #% Rural depopulation is rife , in spite of all the rural development measures . #% After a time of great anguish and pain in our country , these are the good days , John , and thank God you are there to enjoy them and to enjoy the tributes from your friends and colleagues and your countrywomen and men at this particular time in your life . #% Madam President , I want to say some words about Martin O'Hagan , the journalist murdered in Northern Ireland a couple of days ago . #% Mr President , I can not resist starting by saying it is well-known that my Irish colleague across the way lives in the capital city of Dublin where these sites will not be troubling her too much . #% How can we determine if future proposals for labelling and monitoring are adequate when we do not , as yet , know exactly what they are to be ? #% I would , however , like to salute the work the Commission has done this year and to acknowledge the enormous progress in the preparation of the launch of the euro ; the very substantial progress on enlargement which we very much welcome ; the work which is being done in south-eastern Europe ; the break-through on the World Trade Organisation and the very stimulating programme on sustainable development . #% A lie that was perpetrated by people simply for political means . #% If we do not take steps to deal with that , we will fail ultimately . #% Setting Latvian workers against Swedish workers will destroy the Union , Commissioner . #% But alcohol causes major problems throughout society , from health problems , to violence , to abuse against other people and the persons themselves . #% Just let me quote to the Commissioner , and to the Commission , the saying of Oscar Wilde that in our dealings with life , destiny never closes her book . #% Uncertain law is bad law . #% I am anxious that concrete steps be taken by the Commission to reduce the cost to business of complying with 25 different national regimes . #% The reason for asking this question is that over the last eight months several huge seizures of illegal drugs and narcotics have been made across the European Union . #% 
We must monitor the economic consequences of the problem and ensure the effects are minimal . #% I know that there is a ban in place and I would ask the Commission to give us the decisive view on this , because we have received conflicting information from both sides of this debate . #% This is very important if we are to ensure a halt to the depletion of the ozone layer . #% I congratulate him again on reaching a useful conclusion . #% Ireland is holding a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty . #% No other amendment is possible . #% Mr President , I would like to comment on what was said by some of the earlier speakers here . #% She has rightly insisted on the need to enforce the welfare rules which are already in place . #% We must foster trust , patience , fidelity and love . #% In other words , it would mean giving in to the logic of the generals , not accepting the decision of the people and basically undermining the National League for Democracy . #% Annex 1 of the Directive lists the instruments in relation to which the public for the first time are be given the opportunity to participate in the drawing up of plans and programmes . #% I thank him and colleagues who were on the temporary committee for the first year . #% There are a lot of data available , supplied by farmers in meeting the requirements of various programmes and schemes , available to national and European authorities . #% This directive does not mean that Member States can not bring in more stringent measures to curb cigarette smoking if they so wish . #% On the average farm income in the EU in 2003 , we ranked eighth . #% Mr President , last week we celebrated the first anniversary of the largest enlargement to date of the European Union . #% What would happen , for example , either now or some time in the future if a general turned up a European Council meeting in place of the Head of Government or State ? #% We have to ensure that we have a proposal that will encourage others into this industry and bring greater competition . #% I would agree with Mrs Pollack that simply to include the urban dimension in Objective 1 and 2 programmes is not sufficient . #% I recognize that decisions have already been taken but labelling may well be only a short-term or , at least , a medium-term solution to the use of genetically modified products . #% We have so many examples of that in life today . #% Indeed , our postal service is one of the best in Europe . #% The question , and it is an important one , is what comes after Kyoto ? #% Sellafield has an appalling record : it is accident-prone , it pollutes the air and our sea . #% Also , would he not agree that it is extraordinary that the Court can claim that insufficient evidence was provided by the Commission to enable it to make a decision in relation to the imposition of fines ? #% In 1995 over 400 cases of thyroid cancers were documented in children . #% On 4 June 2006 , to the surprise of many , the Islamic Courts militia took control of much of southern Somalia , including the capital Mogadishu -- partially destroyed by now -- when they drove out the powerful faction leaders who had controlled Mogadishu since 1991 , when the central administration was toppled . #% We can now look forward to future reviews of legislation and the work of the contact committee to ensure that there is no violation or abuse of copyright on the Internet or any limitation on genuine private use or fair use . #% Intellectual property rights will have to be put to one side so that we can alleviate the suffering of millions of people who will die needlessly , if we do not find an urgent solution to this issue . #% I suggest that the article in the comes close to the truth . #% There seem to be a lot of vacant seats . #% I did such a course in the Irish language a few months ago and was refused such allowances even though in years past such courses have been sanctioned by Parliament . #% This is a totally unacceptable way of dealing with this extremely important issue . #% Developing countries must be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people under their own licensing terms . #% There must be compassion . #% To achieve real trade justice in this area , these agencies , which support approximately 10 % of world trade , must be taken into democratic public ownership . #% Mr President , speakers have drawn attention to a number of problems , including cigarette smuggling . #% It is important to recognise the tremendous efforts that have been made by France and Finland to reduce their emissions between 1990 and 1995 . #% This is a very worrying trend . #% Those who make their livelihood from fishing and the fruit of fishing in Northern Ireland must have their work sustained by proper safeguards and structural process and policies . #% I do think , however , that had we tried , we could have found an older woman who could have also made an important contribution to the praesidium . #% Can the Council provide an updated assessment on the status of Iceland 's application to join the European Union ? #% Mr President , the evidence coming from Bosnia in particular points clearly to a massive increase in cases of cancer where bombings took place during the Balkans war and where ammunition rounds of depleted uranium were used . #% It is important that the voice of the people 's branch of the European Union is heard on such an important topic . #% I want to follow in a similar vein to the previous speaker . #% This is part of the ongoing framework programme to improve the quality of telecommunications services in Europe . #% I also accept the declaration , albeit reluctantly . #% The whole principle of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty seems to have been done away with here . #% I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Wallis , for her persistence . #% The list proposed by Commissioner Lamy is not restrictive - WTO members could ask for World Health Organisation guidance for any other serious public health problems which may arise in the future or are not covered by the list as it stands . #% For these and many other reasons I voted against the report . #% Could the President confirm that the study which has been carried out would , even at this late stage , look at fisheries in isolation rather than look at fisheries in the global sense ? #% If , as the companies producing them say , there are no health risks , why should we not have a mandatory health indemnity ? #% In the light of all the problems we have had with ineffective implementation , I would like to see the Commission work more strongly on publicizing best practice - good models of using funds effectively . #% There must be no let-up in the efforts to eliminate older animals from suspect herds in the UK , herds known to have consumed infected feed and many of those cattle now incubating the disease . #% in writing . - Transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy . #% If we had the chirpiness of your voice in airports when they called for the last passengers to board , I would be grateful ! #% It would provide a financial incentive for the development of clean technologies that will safeguard the environmental heritage of future generations . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by offering my congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , for a very balanced report . #% We had an excellent presentation from the officer from Europol , Mr Morgan , and I also had the pleasure of announcing the agreement that I think had just been published in the papers that day . #% There are a lot of people who believe , Commissioner , that something more positive could be done with this quality meat product . #% I would especially like to pay tribute to the current Irish Government for the pivotal and skilful role it has played in bringing this initiative to fruition . #% This is the real threat to us all . #% One of the issues high up on the agenda of the new programme for government will be the renegotiation of elements of the EU/IMF programme of support to Ireland . #% Rural development in action is much more interesting than the theory behind it . #% If you look at the stocking rate you will find that if you replace the four or five ewes with one cow - which is the equivalent stocking rate - it will be more expensive to stock this land with cows and you will be producing a product of which there is a one-and-ahalf million tonne surplus . #% 
I want this House to know that a large number of the people who voted ` no ' believed that they were doing no damage to the interests of the eastern European countries . #% Of course , life is not like that and mothers often work outside the home . #% Turning to the Watson report , we all agree on the need for cooperation and coordination in combating terrorism . #% I conclude from your answers both to my question and the previous one that here we have not just a white elephant in the nuclear industry in Europe but a holy cow . #% Per annum , this will mean in practical terms a reduction in the overall annual budget for road safety campaigns from EUR 9.9 million to EUR 8 million . #% There is also a need for a new directive on disability rights which would guarantee that people who suffer from conditions of this kind are not discriminated against in accessing jobs . #% I hope the Minister would agree with that . #% That is not to say that there are not problems or areas of dispute . #% But let me also say in concluding that when we come to appoint an interim and future European Commission , my Group , which has been to the forefront in criticising the current Commission , wishes to make it abundantly clear , that our wish is for a strong , independent political Commission ; and any attempt to weaken this in the future is one that we would resist in Parliamentary terms . #% There is no doubt in my mind that this must be done without calling into question the fundamental principle itself . #% This should not be allowed . #% We should not ignore the fact that the current attempt to undermine the International Criminal Court has implications far wider than simply excluding American forces engaged in international conflicts . #% European leaders must accept that it is perfectly reasonable for people to be concerned about the possible impact which the abolition of the currency in their pockets and its replacement by an unknown and so far non-existent euro will have on their personal circumstances . #% Only then can concrete steps be taken to address the problem . #% However , to even consider , by definition or otherwise , banning all products that come from remunerated donors is a retrograde step . #% I would like to congratulate the Commission on the tremendous work that it has done in dealing with all the applicant countries and the fact that it is now in a position to recommend ten countries for accession . #% I have in my hand the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee report published on 24 October . #% Secondly , we need to give a longer timespan for the guidelines to work . #% It is incumbent on us to send out a clear message that we would expect every government in the European Union to comply fully with the nine years . #% I wonder , Commissioner , whether you have ever considered the possibility of reversing the burden of proof . #% While some women may know they are to work as prostitutes , many do not . #% In underlining that point I would ask the Members of the House to support this particular compromise resolution . #% Our government was obliged by a Supreme Court decision to spend as much money telling the public the reasons to vote `` no '' as the reasons to vote `` yes '' . #% Mr President , on a point of order , may I suggest that you extend the time available for this one-minute speech ? #% We are not in fact meeting our energy commitments under Kyoto at all . #% May I say in conclusion that farmers have always responded in a positive way to the introduction of regulations governing public health and the health status of animals raised for food production . #% I welcome this very good report and congratulate the rapporteur on producing it . #% Tuberculosis is a good example of the contrast between us and our neighbours in the developing world . #% Mr President , I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening . #% The European Commission is best placed to lead a campaign in support of monetary union . #% I particularly would like to ask the UK , France and the United States - although we only have the opportunity in this Parliament to directly address the UK and France - to constrain and curb nuclear weapons development . #% . -- Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Winkler , and President Barroso for their presentations here today . #% The Foreign Minister in Ireland has clarified with the British Ambassador to Ireland and the German Ambassador to London , that there is no objection by the German Government to her release from jail . #% I believe in the rights of everyone , I believe in democracy . #% Therefore we are at a permanent geographical and structural disadvantage . #% As has been said already , it would be completely unacceptable that the arms embargo be lifted , especially in the light of the fact that the Indonesian military have failed to disarm . #% Mr President-in-Office , the work you and your government have done , and are still doing , for peace in Northern Ireland is outstanding . #% Madam President , at the risk of ruining everyone 's Christmas , I heard this morning in the hairdresser 's ... #% Therefore Chernobyl 's problems are our problems , too . #% If we catch 3 million tonnes of fish for industrial purposes in the European Union annually , with 7.5 % to 8 % of that being by-catches of edible fish , then that represents a quarter of a million tonnes of a commodity that is scarce in the European Union , when we are only 48 % self-sufficient . #% The members of the international Quartet , namely the European Union , Russia , the United States and the United Nations , are all committed to this roadmap plan . #% If people have property rights , they will invest in building and constructing properties that have some chance of resisting future damage of this kind . #% I believe both the EU and Member State Governments must further tighten and control the overall operation of the genetic research area and , in particular , the implementation of programmes that do not fully conform to established ethical , environmental and consumer guidelines . #% As we fast approach enlargement , this must remain high on the agenda so that the standards which European consumers have come to expect can be maintained . #% This is another area of grave concern . #% So I think there has to be a fundamental rethink which encourages enterprise and rewards effort and one which has to deal with , as the honourable Member said , some of the structural problems which exist . #% They fear and distrust each other too much . #% The euro is a strong currency for business and it is succeeding , but we must analyse the rules governing economic coordination . #% Commissioner , what has happened to the rational planning directive ? #% We sincerely hope that the Commission will consider carefully its next steps , not only from a purely legal point of view , but also in accordance with the spirit of the agreement reached in Conciliation . ' #% For example , the overall amount indicated for Ireland from the programme is $ 25m . #% Mr President , the tragic events of 11 September have certainly changed the face of the aviation industry and will probably have more effects in the months to come . #% Now the world again faces a crisis and it is more vital than ever that we retain this link and work together to resolve the problems which have beset the world economy . #% Due to our peripheral location and our island status , as Mr Maat has recognised - for which I thank him - we have no realistic alternative to exporting our live cattle by boat , and we need to find export markets for nine out of the ten animals produced on our farms . #% This is a painful process and involves significant economic restructuring . #% The Commission is aware that Member States deploy diverse goals and objectives for national and regional aid policy . #% That said , however , we believe that the exercise just completed has been a positive and valuable exercise . #% Yet they tell us today that Iraq must have its weapons destroyed . #% The quality of the proceedings in the House , I believe , has restored some dignity to the appointment process which unfortunately , because of the prolonged and rather bitter exchanges on 2 May at the European Council , was rather marred at the outset . #% Mr President , I welcome the resolve that was shown here today by the French Presidency and the Commission in placing emphasis on enlargement as the key priority for the external action of the Union . #% I voted for this report but abstained on some amendments as they were part of the negotiated package on the compromise amendments . #% Firstly , there are various pieces of national legislation which already protect workers and this is merely duplicating or replicating what is already in place . #% It takes 9 out of 15 members of the UN Security Council to sign a motion to put the issue on the agenda . #% While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far . #% Finally , the Council , the Commission , Parliament and the Court of Justice all have representatives from each Member State at present , a fact which contributes significantly to the legitimacy which these institutions enjoy in each of our countries . #% Yesterday 's Napster ruling clearly showed that copyright has to be applied to cyberspace . #% 
Despite the initial doubts we had due to the domestic political situation , there were some significant achievements , including the end to the BSE crisis , the association agreement with Slovenia , the two Bosnian conferences to reinforce the Dayton accord and of course the start of the IGC . #% Covering the period between 2007 and 2013 , the EU has at its disposal a budget of almost EUR 17 billion to combat poverty , to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to promote democratic governance in developing countries . #% This is a balance which I really welcome . #% This would mean one less headache for citizens considering temporary residency in another Member State . #% Mr President , all Members of the European Union can take solace from the fact that the European Union economy is performing well and that we have permanent democratic structures operating in all our respective jurisdictions . #% I am sure he is aware of the declining age profile of European farmers . #% I strongly feel that we , as politicians in the democratic world , have a great responsibility to uphold the principles of non-violence and to ensure that such unjustifiable violence does not escalate . #% Has no one in the Council been reading the paper for the last 25 years ? #% There is a commitment here -- and also on the part of the Commission -- to ensure that any legislation or moves in that area will be by codecision . #% When the incoming Presidency sets out its programme , it can often sound a little stale or bored and the reaction to it is also stale . #% Some months ago there was a move in this House to legalize cannabis . #% With regard to energy , the President of the Commission has come forward with a good policy for a common energy policy in Europe , but we should also look at the alternatives , including the opportunity to use fuel crops to produce energy . #% The title of this programme is self-explanatory . #% I wholeheartedly supported this move and now we can let the market set its own standards . #% Institutional reform goes hand-in-hand with the enlargement of the European Union . #% Let us heed the lesson that the EU is strongest when we focus on core areas where value can be achieved by working together in a common interest . #% EMU therefore needs to demonstrate that it can support , underpin and promote cohesion . #% It is clearly the case that there is more room available for economy class passengers travelling with some airlines than with others . #% The EU must also continue to promote an international code of conduct . #% People often talk of European Union as economic this and economic that , but fundamentally , as I have often said on my streets , it is the finest example in the history of the world of conflict resolution . #% Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy . #% The committee still has much work to do and it is seeking support from Parliament to continue its work for a further six months . #% This enables people to help the environment directly and to reduce emissions in their everyday living and buying . #% We all know that , to rise to the challenge of energy saving , it is important that consumers both in the public and private sectors acknowledge and see the benefits which directly engaging with energy-saving initiatives can bring both in environmental and economic terms , but I will give you a warning because there has been an example in my own Member State of gold-plating the directive , particularly in the requirements for energy performance certificates in public buildings , and this has added , in some cases , extra bureaucratic costs with little perceived energy saving and led to a loss of public support ; that is regrettable . #% There is no doubt that consumers are tremendously concerned and I think we have to be able to allay that concern so that consumers can feel confident that the food they buy , anywhere in the European Union , will be fully traceable and good for whoever purchases it . #% We can probably put the underlying situation right in the longer term , but it shows how wrong it is to jump to conclusions at a very early point . #% I believe very strongly that Parliament and the Commission have been very ably served by the Commissioners from small countries -- naturally , in this context I think of my own country . #% in writing . - The reality is that this proposal will have a disproportionate impact upon the peripheral Member States in the European Union , such as Ireland , as centrally located Member States have the option of switching to rail . #% In particular , I wish to see mutual recognition and respect for decisions and judicial processes . #% Finally , I want to make the point that this issue is not the same as the issue of violence between strangers . #% NGOs , government bodies , international organisations and local authorities must work together to deliver multisector emergency assistance to those in need . #% This is a part of our problem . #% From an Irish perspective , I am pleased that this report does not come up with any findings against the Irish Government , and this is in line with assurances given by the US authorities . #% We also need new sustainable technologies . #% I was hoping the Commissioner was late because he was putting the final touches to the evaluation of Malta . #% But it is up to Member States , if they wish to respond to the Council proposal , to put forward their reaction for other Member States to consider and for the Commission to react to . #% It important that we incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the existing European Union treaties , but I also hope that the European Convention on Human Rights will be incorporated into the EU as an institution and not simply into the legal systems of the individual Member States . #% It is regrettable that in different Member States , there are different levels of care for people with epilepsy . #% Mr President , each year in Europe alone 38,000 animals are routinely killed after being used to test the development of new cosmetic products . #% In congratulating the presidency on the progress made to date , I would also like to issue a warning . #% Also , with new designs of landfill sites , certain of the dangers have been eliminated . #% Could he give us some idea of exactly what is on the table and what is being offered to Iran in these circumstances ? #% For the court to say that golf clubs are getting the single farm payment is erroneous . #% However , it is happening and it should be celebrated . #% I am staggered at the absence of a single , solitary word of reference to the ECHO programme . #% We should regard this as an urgent priority . #% Secondly , as an Irish Member , I am indeed very pleased that the workers in Dell who have been made redundant at least now have an opportunity to look forward and to plan for the future . #% Lastly , I should like to say to the Commissioner that in Ireland it is hard to take her recommendations on organic farming seriously , when she will not allow us to declare the island a GMO-free zone . #% Unfortunately , too often the stimulus for improving road and transport safety comes from devastating lessons that are hard learned from the past . #% I should like to stress that this untying of aid from trade is not a final step , but it is one means of increasing the effectiveness of granting aid . #% We vote here , we go home and we forget that in a couple of years the votes we take here are implemented in Member States . #% Nobody has absolute confidence that anybody else is carrying out the supervision and enforcing the law as they should and we will end up in the same situation with this agreement . #% It is essential that the applicant countries put into place the body of EU law already adopted to fight organized crime across Europe . #% New embryology is proving that adult and other post-natal stem cells have vast biomedical potential , as great or greater than embryonic stem cell potential , which is already being described as old embryology . #% We urgently have to take this issue on but what I fear is happening is an attempt by some Member States to renege on agreements that they made in Edinburgh and fail to meet the targets they agreed . #% I am therefore deeply disappointed at the negative attitude of the Council of Ministers which can not even be bothered to get a proper legal base for the SAVE II programme . #% If , for example , we can get the majority of the Member States to support this policy and to adopt it , then of course we would like to see the Commission support it as well . #% We have long argued for the development of research in clinical methods in the fight against HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries . #% I have two questions to put to the Commission . #% Although it is a very toxic substance , the benefit still outweighs the risk when your child is less likely to die of persistent organic pollution poisoning than of malaria . #% EU money must not be wasted solely for the fulfilment of those obsessed with pushing their idealistic notions of a shared EU history or identity . #% However , I do not believe that these peace talks were a complete failure either . #% Thirdly , the Member States will have to redesign their pension scheme policies - and this has been mentioned too by many speakers - so that the principle of solidarity between the generations can be maintained . #% He has demonstrated a great deal of sensitivity in this area and for that I thank him . #% Equatorial Guinea is notorious in relation to that and you did not address the question . #% This can not be allowed to continue . #% 
Are you in favour of it or are you against it ? ' #% Secondly , we need to ensure that , whatever tools we introduce , we are able to respond rapidly and effectively to whatever crisis presents itself . #% Part of the motivation behind Agenda 2000 is to conform in a credible way with world trade rules and in the process , of course , to make Europe a key player in world trade - and the Americans will not want that . #% No country had a programme which was sufficient in all areas . #% It is essential that it is workable across 25 countries and it is essential that the subsidiarity principle is enshrined in our legislation so that we can achieve high standards that work at national level . #% I think particularly of two Ukrainian doctors who narrowly escaped death after exposing a government-licensed trade in human tissue obtained from aborted but living 20-week-old foetal babies . #% If we reduce the fishing effort to such an extent that fishermen can not meet their legitimate repayments there is no future for them . #% It is a crime if , as a result of late payments , small firms go to the wall . #% By the time it takes to discuss this topic , almost one thousand people will have died of hunger somewhere in the world - the majority of them in Africa . #% Would the Commissioner not agree that it is scandalous that no fines were imposed on the Italian authorities by the European Court of Justice , given that it is now almost 20 years since the matter was first brought to the Commission 's attention , and that on each occasion when the Court has decided on this matter , it has found against Italy ; and that even today , as I understand it , in La Sapienza University the criteria laid down have still not been complied with ? #% We welcome manufacturers ' development of pedestrian-friendly car fronts , automatic braking systems and the use of daylight running lights , although obviously there is controversy on that particular topic . #% Mr Simpson is perhaps the person we know best . #% I can say , however , that this whole area is being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference . #% I refer to the comments made in a statement this morning by Mrs Fontaine regarding certain logistical problems in the building . #% Priorities may change rapidly , according to our political agendas and those of our partners , but a procedural regulation will ensure that implementation can go on unhindered . #% There can be no doubting the depth of the crisis , with , across the EU , a 35 % fall in jobs in ten years , falling prices , falling catches , a 40 % dependence on imports , and a 100 % hike in fuel prices in the last two years . #% When errors or problems arise in the implementation of EU laws , not only are citizens denied their rights , but the very credibility of the EU as a law-making institution is undermined . #% On the legislative programme : as regards its form I am glad it is going to the committees within the House . #% Most experts anticipate that if fusion is ever to achieve commercialisation it will not be for at least another 50 years . #% For instance , how do the British people like the idea of trains carrying nuclear materials continuing to run through London and other cities in Britain ? #% This is certainly a very contentious issue in my own area of Dublin . #% Whilst Members may criticise his political skills or his unwillingness to give them the answers to the questions they wanted , at least give him recognition for the courtesy of coming to us . #% We respect in the act of voting tomorrow the essential collegiality of the European Commission and regard that as an essential value for its working method . #% I am particularly pleased that we have achieved the inclusion of gender mainstreaming in this new programme . #% I agree with it -- it is a good piece of legislation -- with the sole exception of the inclusion of solar radiation . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this very comprehensive report . #% My real point of order is this : I strongly deplore the fact that , while Mr Le Pen was speaking in this Chamber , the French National Front waved the Irish flag beside him . #% A recommendation is basically non-binding . #% in writing . - Having worked on this area at Committee level before , I am obliged to stress the point that impact assessments must be free from outside interference and that this independence must be protected at all levels . #% Obviously there are problems within our lawmaking process ; there are difficulties which we can all recognise and see in our everyday working lives . #% It deserves the protection against risks proposed by the rapporteur in this report . #% Can we achieve a proper balance ? #% We have until the end of 2002 for Nice to be ratified . #% I take this opportunity to warn the Irish Government that it is following a very dangerous path . #% Recent events have established , through the work of this House , the need to establish ethical and normative rules for the conduct of European affairs . #% Returning now to the priorities which you have outlined for your presidency , we fully agree with the emphasis you have put on unemployment , organized crime , drugs and fighting fraud . #% It is perhaps understandable that the preparations for the single currency have received considerably more public attention than the IGC in view of the direct and obvious impact which the Euro will have on our daily lives . #% I believe the European Union should co-operate on an international level in combating terrorism , organised crime and individual criminals , all of whom use the differences in legal systems to avoid standing trial . #% Nevertheless , there must be infinite compassion for those who have been stricken . #% For that reason we need a dedicated unit within the Commission to draw together the many programmes . #% I call on the Commission , through the Seventh Framework Programme , to provide financial support for the further development of blood-based tests , to provide funding for comprehensive investigation into the causes of breast cancer , to urge Member States to set up information and counselling centres , whilst simultaneously reporting back to the European Parliament on the results of more recent research conducted in this very important area . #% Over-regulation stifles initiative and , therefore , progress and prosperity . #% The precautionary principle is something that we must adhere to within the European Union and it must be respected at all times . #% Mr. President , I would like to join with the other speakers in complementing the rapporteur for her work on this very important report . #% Cohesion is the overriding objective in our Treaty , it stands over and above EMU and that is why we believe that EMU and its processes and stages need to be scrutinized to see how they contribute to cohesion policy . #% This is in nobody 's interests in either rural or urban areas . #% Routine post-mortem examinations are carried out by veterinary surgeons employed by the Department on all animals slaughtered . #% It is amazing that so little progress has been made . #% Every effort must be made to secure the maximum number of jobs . #% The European Council , which represents the fifteen Governments of the EU , originally did not include any provisions relating to the elimination of hazardous substances in this new Water Directive . #% As a result , as every speaker so far has said , certain committees raised questions on the suitability , or otherwise , of individuals . #% I share the rapporteur 's view about transparency . #% As I have done on so many occasions in the past , I repeat my call that in order to ensure an appropriate policy of decentralisation it is essential to maintain access to the territorial waters of 12 miles as the exclusive sovereign preserve of the coastal States and to extend this preserve to 24 miles , as previously agreed by this House in February 1999 . #% So they are popular and we need to regulate and open up this area for consumers and business . #% Because of procrastination then hundreds of thousands of people needlessly died in ethnic cleansing . #% So can I just be very clear : we insist no loopholes are created by not possible derogations , exceptional derogations . #% As has already been said , Europe produces only about one-fifth of its protein needs and we import soya to fill that gap . #% We are no better or no worse , but we do compare with the higher standards of accountancy and accountability . #% I believe that securing agreement for such a new arrangement would help to improve relations between the European Union and the Syrian people . #% I believe that we must ensure that all facilities are checked to allow for the maximum protection of facilities and , more importantly , for the safety and security of the populations in their locations . #% The provisional application of this protocol will depend on the first payment being made before 31 December this year . #% These people want to ensure that they can continue in their role as fishermen feeding all the peoples of Europe and maintain strong , rural coastal communities . #% There are a number of points that I wish to make today . #% Commissioner , I appeal to you again to have another look at your proposals , come back and be mindful of the people that you represent . #% Often that is not made very clear . #% Northern Ireland which I represent is such a region . #% 
The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining statutory applications . #% Having burned the people of the Darfur region of Sudan into graves and refugee camps , they have created a militarised zone -- a terror zone -- that separates Sudan , north and south . #% At the outset , I wish to compliment the Commissioner on his good work in a very difficult area . #% Apart from having the Presidency , it is a particularly important case for Austria . #% It is very clear from this letter that the UK Government does not want any involvement of social partners or the issue of social partnership . #% I did not hear him mention the island of Ireland . #% The experience in my constituency is that businesses see no sign of it . #% Mr President , I welcome the great role that Parliament has in the process of Agenda 2000 . #% A new information technology age has arrived . #% That is in no small measure a result of your role in the Chair . #% Again , that remains to be confirmed but apparently there is a spread of sheep from Carlisle to a mart in Armagh , which straddles the border of the Leinster Euro constituency I represent and the exclusion zone . #% It is wrong that our money is being used in this way . #% Mr President , I intended to vote against , instead of for , Amendment No 4 to the Arias Cañete report . #% The light transit system should be part of an integrated transport system . #% What is going to be the outcome of that ? #% As a result of a recent competition policy decision , over EUR 1 billion of much-needed UK regional regeneration investment in poor urban areas and derelict sites has been cut by 75 % . #% A parent company must have effective means of exercising control over its subsidiaries . #% I should therefore like to know what planning will take place in future . #% The impact assessment estimate for the UK , if maternity leave is extended to 20 weeks , is almost GBP 2.5 billion per year on average . #% On the Israeli side there has been a failure to meet commitments , to dismantle settlement outposts and to freeze settlement activity . #% Mr President , purgatory is just as painful as hell , but you do not stay there permanently -- I am told . #% It is not perfect , but at least it is something . #% As a result of the adoption of this text and other proposals , I abstained on the final vote . #% Much of the report , I feel , is very badly drafted and very repetitive . #% He has confirmed what we have said all along , that basically the Nice Treaty is not necessary for enlargement . #% Mr President , I meant no disrespect to you or to Mr Rübig , who has produced an excellent report , or to the Commissioner , by being late , but , as my colleague has explained , it was completely outside my control . #% This would give the local fishing interests a wider scope and a more solid basis on which to plan their investments . #% I am referring to social and environmental concerns which this Parliament has always supported but which are not yet sufficiently articulated in the energy sector with reference to the single market . #% If the report goes through plenary as it is , the Verts/ALE Group will have to vote against it . #% Could it be , Mr Barroso , that he is the right man in the wrong job ? #% This advertising cheapens all women . #% Parliament 's duty should first and foremost be to the citizens , not to industry or the military . #% As they are currently drafted , they are misleading and have led both to business lobbying MEPs and complaining about the lack of clarity and to consumers letting us know that there are information gaps . #% It is not only the present generation which will benefit from these new changes , but also future generations . #% In Hong Kong last December I witnessed Korean farmers fighting for a livelihood which is currently being threatened by transnational grain corporations , who are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries . #% Finally , we can give leadership , as we already have done , and the best way to do so is by example , not merely by criticising people who do not agree with us . #% The Member States apparently lack the political will to fulfill their obligations . #% What is most amazing is the silence of the British Members of this House . #% We have asked direct questions and we should have direct answers before we go to vote . #% Clearly , more than any other time , there is a need for financial institutions to pause and reassess their approach . #% If we had that ECU 7 billion today to devote to the rural development aspects of our agricultural policy , it could be put to use to achieve social and economic objectives which are closer to the hearts of most people in this Parliament . #% It is quite ironic that , when you read through the speeches of the people who were there that day , who won the Nobel Peace Prize , all of them said that the peace efforts they were involved in only came about through dialogue , respect for diversity , tolerance and equality . #% In light of this reality , I would ask the Commission to issue a particular reference to the patenting of the human embryo at the stage of stem cells . #% Indeed I will go further and call for the exclusion of those workers who are involved in the processing of fresh fish - and I emphasise fresh fish - because there is no continuity of supply when we are dealing with fish . #% This directive has been a great catalyst : it has pulled us up short to look at what we mean by our culture and to put a value on it that perhaps was lacking in many of our other deliberations . #% In any event , they prevented meat trucks and other trucks from Ireland accessing routes through the UK to the continent . #% Parliament has adopted amendments which define nuclear technology as unsustainable , and here we all need to clarify what we mean with regard to sustainability and the nuclear issue . #% In conclusion , as a result of the Cologne Summit of March of last year , it has been agreed that the EU budget will be worth over # 506 billion during the seven-year period , i.e. 2000-2006 . #% We must now proceed in a planned way with their integration . #% We must respect differences and give a proper and meaningful role to the different religions in the European Union , but we expect mutual recognition . #% The number of placements obtained to EURES , rose from 26 449 in 1998 to 44 460 in 1999 : that is an increase of more than 68 % in one year and the potential for more placement is much greater . #% Could I also ask her as a matter of form to include in that package the need for proper consultation and communication between neighbouring States within the European Union , including the accession States , so that concerns can be discussed in a proper way , in a proper consultative forum . #% I want to speak a little about what our role as parliamentarians should be . #% I am also concerned about United Kingdom organic farmers being undermined by products from Eastern European countries . #% It also bioaccumulates , which means that it stays in the body and builds up over time . #% Mr President , I support Mr Bowe and his report and the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection . #% We know the emotional pain and human tragedy that resulted , largely because of the controversy about vaccination . #% There is no point in the Americans saying `` we support the Israelis in what they are doing '' or `` we are calling on them to be more moderate in their response . '' #% It is going to irreversibly damage the people and the environment and it will not solve the drugs problem . #% I should have spoken earlier on , but we will deal with that later . #% I can not see how the Council can now wash its hands of at least discussing the possibility of lifting those sanctions . #% A major portion of that will be caused by the ageing of Europe , which will pose a particular challenge . #% Nothing has been done although there was an instant reaction from the Commission when the fact that 12 million people are under threat of famine in Ethiopia came to public attention . #% The European Union and the United States have a strategic role to play in the recovery process . #% While benefits have undoubtedly flowed for farmers , there has been -- as has been said repeatedly this evening -- a greater and real increase in the risk factors . #% We fear that the Commission 's Declaration was an attempt to compromise the difficult political agreement reached between the European Parliament and Council and with the support of the Commission . #% 
However , that requires us to make an investment to guarantee that the technology is available for all and , through our taxation , to give preference to energies that are less damaging to the environment , as we did with the introduction of unleaded petrol many years ago . #% However , could I take this opportunity to ensure that , with the good offices of the Commission , and utilising the partnership agreements we have with Nigeria , there will be a greater understanding , not only of the respect for human rights , but also of our total abhorrence of the death penalty in any form , whether it be by electric chair or by stoning or by any other method . #% The reason I put this question to the Council was to try and establish whether the Council and the European Union can put more emphasis on education , because in developing countries if you have the three basics - reading , writing and arithmetic - even at the simplest level , you can challenge the village elders and the leaders in your community . #% It is estimated that up to 400 000 people have been killed and more than two and a half million people displaced or made homeless in the last three years due to conflict . #% It is also true that focusing on the economic agenda does not mean that we are downgrading other agendas , be this the environment or the social agenda . #% The European Parliament is carrying out a very serious inquiry and the Committee of Inquiry is going to need more time to complete its work . #% Finally , we live in challenging and uncertain times and the political situation in the Middle East is very volatile . #% Again , it shows the willingness of the Community to honour its commitments to the poorer regions . #% As several previous speakers have mentioned , they have been locked in dispute on what many of us would regard as one of the basic human rights , that of the workers to join a trade union and be represented by a trade union . #% Mr President , I can safely say that we in Ireland have been proud of our Irish presidency and of our Taoiseach in the role of President . #% It can sometimes be quite ludicrous : as a home carer myself , for a short period of time I had someone sent in by the state to give me a few hours ' help a week . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , in a crisis , one sometimes has to act quickly - and it is clear that the eurozone is not out of its crisis - but one also has to act intelligently . #% Secondly , biofuels are environmentally friendly and they emit between 40 and 80 % fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels . #% Sports transcends all boundaries . #% All of these things are necessary if we are to create a Europe of which we can be proud and which citizens will feel they own . #% Will the Council state specifically that existing nuclear reactors which do not meet standards will be closed ? #% However , with 18 million people in the Union affected by unemployment including the young and the long-term unemployed , this objective is not being met . #% We should be very careful to maintain a balance : the magazine did subsequently print my article , although not in the special nuclear edition . #% All I want us to do is to meet our commitment to these people . #% Much has been written about the democratic deficit and voter alienation in the European Union . #% Could you comment on that in particular , and would you urge other Member States to do what Ireland did in relation to the new Member States already here ? #% UNIFIL II must be successful . #% Such a system will also promote the convergence and coordination of the different national legal systems and enable parties to check on the status of trading partners and suppliers , especially in an age of on-line trading . #% Because of that complexity , plus the changes in nomenclature , the activity-based budgeting and enlargement , it has been a difficult task to give an overall view . #% I know that the rapporteur has endeavoured to be realistic with his target of 15 % . #% The EU Convention must remember that many candidate countries are due to hold referenda on EU accession . #% There is a balance to be struck between the rights of the individual and the rights of the common good . #% All right-minded people support the Roadmap for peace because this will ensure the creation of a future Palestinian State with territorial contiguity . #% This time there has been no suspension and good sense has prevailed on both sides . #% I welcome the three-phase peace plan proposed here . #% . -- Mr President , this own-initiative report , prepared jointly by myself and Mr Silva Peneda , with the essential support of our respective staffs , is a very important contribution to the ongoing debate about the future of Europe and the role that Europe 's social model can play in re-energising the unification of our continent . #% The core elements of this Directive ensure the protection of surface water , coastal water , internal waste and ground water now and into the future . #% As has been mentioned , the Convention will now be reporting to European governments during the Greek Presidency of the Union . #% The DAA said that , if the Department of Transport gives the go-ahead , which seems very likely , and the equipment proved successful , the scanners could be extended to Cork and Shannon airports . #% As I have stated here on previous occasions , this crisis is having a greater impact on Irish beef producers and on the Irish economy than any other Member State . #% In relation to the election results , as I have already said , we welcome the initial assessment but we will consider the final reports on the conduct of the elections from the international monitors before we make up our minds on the fairness or otherwise of the elections . #% I fully support the objective of the regulation and we must agree on a timetable to implement noise standards , but it must be one based on objective performance criteria and not design criteria . #% Families have been separated and sent to different countries . #% It was high time that these newly-developed fisheries for deepwater species were brought under some sort of control . #% Two days ago the Legal Service of Parliament , acting as the agents of the House and , under that power of delegation , made a presentation to the European Court of Justice in respect of a case brought by Eurotunnel on the sensitive question of duty-free sales . #% I do not apportion blame - there is wrong on both sides , but I do stress the need for an immediate and effective ceasefire . #% Parliament is not a rubber stamp , it has the power of codecision . #% This amendment was rejected by the House and therefore I abstained in the final vote . #% This would restrict emissions within the European Union in the long term while advancing a strategy which would minimize the economic cost as a whole . #% With regard to the Middle East , the most important lesson for us of the last six months has been our failure to speak properly , with a single voice , and to give a clear message to all those countries -- whatever they try -- that if they do something wrong , action will be taken by the European Union against them . #% I trust that many more charges will follow , for that is the only way to deal with the processes of terrorism . #% Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies . #% This report is viewed with extreme concern , regardless of what the rapporteur has said with regard to the United Kingdom . #% Arising from our visit and in particular our visit to the refugee camps in eastern Nepal , the delegation gave a commitment that they would do everything possible to raise the issue of the continuing plight of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal . #% Mr President , the final stage for the completion of a European single market relates to the introduction of economic and monetary union within the European Union . #% Some of the factors involved in competitiveness include - as Mrs Plooij has identified - the single market and coordination and compatibility between Member States . #% She has made considerable progress . #% As others have already mentioned , it is not a perfect solution , but it is necessary at this time . #% Perhaps you could give me your view as to whether that should be included in your future strategy on alcohol and the problems related to it . #% Madam President , I wish to thank Mr Rehder for his report . #% That is constantly undermining what is unique not only about Europe as a continent but also about the individual Member States . #% In fact I understand that the UK Government is only wanting ECU 51 million of that , therefore not taking up ECU 175.304 million . #% As a result of the implementation of this Directive , the safety of water quality standards in Europe will substantially improve . #% author . - Mr President , I welcome this cross-party resolution calling for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit held captive since 2006 by the military wing of Hamas . #% But this issue , concerning the physical , psychological and physiological safety of the Union 's children must be seen by our citizens to command a priority position on the Union 's agenda . #% The understandable desire of childless couples to have children must not override the human dignity and health of the donors being exploited . #% Neither of them would ever come forward with any positive support to help the fishermen . #% The repealing of four labour laws on 16 July by the Provisional Legislative Council was also discussed . #% Last year the European Union established a human rights dialogue with China . #% EURES job offers went from 43 000 at the start of 1998 to 166 000 at the beginning of 2000 . #% As Mr Provan mentioned , the tourism industry is in further severe difficulty too after the crisis which followed the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease . #% 
There is no doubt in my mind that we will soon be asked to approve further funding . #% I welcome the fact that the Swedish government is going to ensure that employment and environmental matters stay at the top of the agenda during its presidency of the Union . #% Mr President , the Commissioner has received a great deal of advice today , so I am not going to repeat anything other than the fact that we all hope that Romania and Bulgaria will meet the criteria and join the European Union . #% This demonstrates the wide extent and influence of EU fleets . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution because of the importance of tackling Alzheimer 's disease in Europe . #% I am not convinced that our current rules meet my concerns and I do not believe that computerised systems alone will protect us . #% I still believe that the subject of Structural and Cohesion Funds in Objective 1 regions is the competence of the European Union and as such deserves a more thorough answer . #% The trade in wild animal meat for human consumption is just one part of a wildlife trade which includes ivory , fur and the trade in certain animal body parts -- a trade which threatens biodiversity and the ecological balance of areas such as Central and West Africa . #% In Spain the situation has not changed . #% There are many lessons to be learnt from the experiences of the outbreak . #% I also take this opportunity to wish her all the best in the election to become President of Ireland . #% That is also an urgent matter . #% The benefits of the change from an adversarial to a consensual approach are very clear to everybody . #% This paragraph calls on a judge at the European Court of Justice to resign his European post due to his earlier personal decision when he was Minister for Justice to permit the early release of Marc Diedres who is suspected of multiple child murders . #% Article 10 requires Member States to actively cooperate with the Commission in dealing with complaints , to clarify facts and to state official positions . #% It is important that we have equality in the provision of state aid for all convergence regions , including the statistical effect areas . #% Ring vaccination has to be the way in which we look at trying to control it . #% I can find no basis for the Commission 's optimism that farming incomes will increase except at the expense of a sharp decline in numbers . #% This study should also address the need to strengthen competition policy instruments to prevent predatory pricing and its unwanted side effects . #% I would ask you , now that you are President of the Council , will you push forward with this extremely important proposal . #% in writing . - The problem of the trafficking of human beings has been with us for a long time , but instead of getting to grips with the issue , Member States stand indicted for our individual and collective failure to deal with this exploitation and degradation of women . #% European Member State governments are also required to connect all public administrations to broadband usage by 2005 . #% Mr President , first I should like to congratulate Mr Linkohr , not least for his patience in this apparently never-ending saga of the refinancing of the fourth framework programme . #% It is very difficult to get any information from the Foreign Office even though the new Labour Government has promised openness and transparency . #% Community rules , at the present time , do not allow for a higher Community participation . #% Finally , Mr President , I would like to thank President Barroso for coming to the Chamber . #% This proposal supplements the existing EC legal framework , under which the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation , applies only to employment , occupation and vocational training . #% A major question facing development countries is the illicit acquisition of public funds by government officials who store them in offshore accounts . #% It is planting season now in southern Sudan . #% I fully support this proposal and would like to commend Mr Rothley for his work in bringing these proposals to this stage . #% It will also ensure that they can have equal benefits with every other worker in the Union . #% I understand the anxieties of the adoptive parents , but I also appreciate the reasons behind the ban on inter-country adoptions . #% I ask the House not to deviate from this figure , which can be accommodated within the existing guidelines , and also to support amendments on compensation for extensification , the rural world premium and funding for market developments . #% The Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland has reported that nearly half of all organised crime groups are involved in IP crime . #% We need to ensure that the rights of such people can be carried across borders . #% The Commission and EIB therefore should act together with national governments in implementing the TENs packages through the use of loan guarantees and other financial investments . #% I have two final points . #% Mr President , at the end of July and the beginning of August 2003 I attended the summing-up of the trial in Bogota of three Irishmen accused of training the FARC in Colombia . #% In the special report on the reform of the cereals sector , the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to the question of whether or not the policy itself attains its economic and social objectives . #% This is clearly not the case . #% We have a duty to respond to their plight . #% In my opinion this is a more reasonable and pragmatic way forward , but critically it is workable and achievable . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mrs Jensen for her report and congratulating her on it . #% I congratulate you , Mr Martin , for a first-class report on this important subject and I hope that the unanimous vote of approval in the Committee on Fisheries will be echoed by a unanimous vote in the House today . #% I was the author of that particular amendment and I thank my colleagues for their support . #% Let me pick out the points that we think are most important : infrastructure , legal certainty - people must know where they are - and the skills offensive , which ought , please , to be targeted not simply at our schoolchildren and students but at groups which have been neglected , such as women and older people , who represent an enormous source of skill if it were to be exploited . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate and to put on record -- not for the first time -- my concern regarding the ethical guidelines for research funding . #% The kind of Europe the Nice Treaty proposes is far more detrimental to the eastern European countries , because it divides Europe . #% In my own experience as chairman of group C , examining some of the Latin American countries , I have to say that the cooperation has been very good . #% Care for the frail and elderly is a challenge that faces us all and unfortunately it is one that we will probably all face ourselves at some stage in our lives . #% I have known the honourable Member for a long number of years and I find very little to disagree with him about . #% Energy infrastructure will be the foundation of our future economic growth . #% I would urge all Members to support this resolution . #% Instead of being a puppet of the Israelis , the US should be independent and use its influence to pressurise them to end their violence , just as we , in the EU , must use our influence with the Palestinians to do likewise . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the EU 's social protection and social inclusion process is core to ensuring the achievement of the European Union 's strategic goal of sustained economic growth , more and better jobs and greater social cohesion . #% The Member States too must take their responsibilities seriously and ensure good and correct implementation of internal market laws . #% Madam President , I think that , as has already been mentioned here tonight , the key is to have women in decision-making roles and in positions of power . #% The rapporteur has shown great tenacity in steering a very difficult course between many different viewpoints , and has arrived the best possible solution . #% I suggest that we now need to make immediate use of the existing network and to ensure , at the same time , that there is improved support for it . #% However , I do wonder about the wisdom of this . #% We do so because we fail at national level to integrate the various economic , social , cultural and environmental policies that we pursue . #% There is a better way to enforce the law , to make it more equitable and to ensure that we can react to the concerns of the individual addicts who want to recover and get treatment . #% I also want to see maximum regional flexibility permitted within the regulation . #% Finally , phone penetration in Ireland , which presently stands at 15 % of the population , is set to double by the end of the year . #% Dr William Hesseltine , the chief executive of Human Gene Sciences Inc. , has already patented 100 human genes and his company has submitted applications for 8000 . #% My colleagues , in my group from Ireland , will not be voting in support of the censure on the Commission . #% 
I must , however , stress that we are only halfway there . #% The question has also been raised in our follow-up about the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor . #% The devastated pig producers there have had to have a financially-assisted scheme to remove unwanted animals from their farms . #% There is no doubt that this reform of structural and Cohesion Funds represents the most significant changes in the last ten years with a view to meeting the challenges of enlargement and EMU . #% I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report on a difficult subject . #% The major issue facing democratic leaders is how to respond to this latest atrocity . #% They spent 53 hours at sea in a Force 10 gale in a container surrounded by furniture . #% in writing . - We should remember that 54 % of farmed land in the EU currently falls into a LFA classification . #% Mr Mulder makes the point in his report that the people who commit offences should have to pay for them . #% They do not need to be protected from themselves and they do not like being treated as children and being asked to leave the room when sex is being discussed . #% I thank the President-in-Office again for his reply , but I would urge that this be followed more closely still with regard to the most basic human rights that I have mentioned . #% Consequently , the European company would not have reaped the benefits and , indeed , there could have been an infringement of a patent owned by a multinational . #% It will need to deal with the waste if we are to end this extravagance . #% I would hate anyone to misunderstand or misinterpret the decision of the Irish electorate not to approve the Treaty of Nice , because the Irish population in general , even those who oppose the adoption of the Treaty of Nice , is in favour of enlargement . #% It is a central tenet of the Lisbon Agenda that legislation should be simple , clear and enforceable . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work and for the many additions to the Commission 's proposals , particularly on health and disease and sustainable transport . #% That loophole must be closed . #% If a Member State does not apply European Union law , it is a matter for the Commission to pursue that matter . #% It is a direct challenge to the European Union and is part of the attempt by the United States to establish superiority in every region throughout the world . #% I have therefore included in the report a call for legislation to ensure meat and bonemeal is never again used in ruminant feeds and that ruminant feeds can not be produced on any premises where meat and bonemeal is present . #% in writing . - We can not wait for another catastrophe before acting to protect air passengers . #% It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo . #% We need excise regimes that favour bio-fuels and bio-flexi-fuels . #% As a basis for the basic law of what the European Union will be in the future , it is a very good document . #% However , we should not be thinking of cutting back on farm expenditure and need to avail of the ample margins available to us . #% Amendment 14 also mentions women living in poverty in rural or remote communities . #% It is an appeal , therefore , for the quality of European democracy and not simply an appeal for the interests of Members of this House . #% The Commissioner mentioned the need to extend CDMs . #% What we must avoid is imposing restrictive legislation that will hamper free trade and competition and cause damage to a thriving health store sector . #% The Commission argued that this zero tolerance policy could not be implemented , since the technical detection methods for identifying processed animal protein had not previously been sufficiently accurate to take account of the so-called adventitious presence of small amounts of protein from small birds , mammals and rodents accidentally caught in the harvesting process . #% The European Year must be about much more than raising awareness simply about discrimination . #% For that reason it is extremely important that the most severe restrictions are put into place in Great Britain . #% I think that emphasis should be put on the building of coastguard or marine protection vessels to control and monitor the common fisheries policy . #% Having said that , I think it is important to bring a bit of balance into the debate . #% On the one hand we have the Commission 's explanatory memorandum openly acknowledging that the North Sea Regional Advisory Council is a principal forum for advice in relation to the management plan for the preservation and regeneration of plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea . #% Mr President , could you explain procedurally what happened to paragraph 3 ? #% However , now is a time for us to be braver , to look at new ideas and new ways of engagement . #% It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe , providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it . #% This outcome created great uncertainty for a number of reasons . #% There are many more untapped possibilities . #% In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information , economic as well as biological . #% We have to tackle the problem of space debris . #% We need to have a real evaluation of what success the past cuts have had and what information is available to be examined . #% No Member State can actually pat itself on the back if we do not know exactly the end result of what they are doing . #% I believe that the farm-to-table principle has now become a core principle which underpins all regulation in the food and feed area . #% The report tries to make much of Article 2 of the Framework Agreement , but the flaw therein is that while it bestows on the Commission President the obligation to identify and act upon conflicts of interests affecting Commissioners , nothing is put in place to identify and act upon such conflicts affecting the President himself . #% In that context , I agree fully with the rapporteur that funding for rural development should not involve robbing the first pillar to pay for the second pillar . #% This is a practical demonstration of how Europe can be brought closer to its citizens by involving citizens in the planning and implementation of the programmes , although I agree with Mrs Kallenbach that this must be real , rather than apparent . #% I am even more thankful that given the endless , faceless bureaucracy that people have to deal with in our process democracy , we have , as this report points out , a well-intentioned Ombudsman . #% We are calling on both sides to cooperate fully with the International Red Cross on the question of the disappeared and missing since the conflict began . #% So it is unacceptable that this aspect has not been properly assessed and taken into account . #% My own country , the United Kingdom - the windiest country in Europe - has some lessons to learn from work in other countries . #% Acts such as these serve simply to confuse , without serving any real purpose . #% This creates a system where there is free movement of people from one Member State to the next . #% Many of them are children who simply disappear and are murdered and are never found again . #% Investment schemes will cover Farm Waste Management , Improvement in Dairy Hygiene Standards and Housing and Handling Facilities for Alternative Enterprises . #% The Spanish fleet is distributed across a very long list including Belize , Honduras , the Netherlands Antilles , Panama and many others . #% Though Commissioner Almunia must be applauded for his favourable comments on the crisis today , we as MEPs also have the opportunity through this report to aid an industry which has just been brought to its knees for the third time in the last ten years . #% Member States must be given the flexibility they require to implement the solutions they need to achieve their Lisbon objectives , hopefully by stimulating employment through a reduction in direct taxation , especially a reduction in labour taxes . #% The Union can not hide from the naked fact that the EU itself , together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , will have to play a key role in terms of financial contributions and technical support to make safe all these nuclear reactors sooner rather than later . #% As Mrs Frahm mentioned in relation to registration , it is absolutely incredible that you can actually trace a piece of meat or an agricultural product , yet you can not trace a lethal weapon . #% However , the report has several glaring omissions - more than I can mention , so I will confine myself to the subject of China . #% I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland , a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue . #% In all our translations of the report we have been very careful to monitor how it was translated . #% We can not shy away from the challenges , both economic and environmental , with which we are currently faced . #% The long term consequences will be that we go back a hundred years to where people will be dying from diseases which presently can be cured by antibiotics . #% 
I agree with the Tillich report , and particularly with the author 's strategy of improving budgetary procedures and working towards the preparation of correct projections so that the budget as we see it projected is actually the budget that is necessary to fulfil its objective . #% A strongly funded common agricultural policy will protect Europe 's food security , contribute to our climate change targets and maintain employment in our rural communities . #% It is estimated that 1.5 million people have died since the introduction of sanctions . #% We have to make sure it never happens again . #% The extent to which biodiversity impacts on the lives of all citizens and the quality or otherwise of their lives makes this debate extremely important . #% The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization forecast world sugar consumption at 145 million tonnes for 2004 and 2005 , with production at 143 million tonnes . #% I wonder whether we could put names and faces on that downsizing . #% The Stability and Growth Pact calls for Member States to reach , in the medium term , a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus . #% Negotiations for the prospective enlargement of the European Union have accelerated at a strong pace and it is now likely that negotiations with many of the applicant countries may indeed be concluded before the end of this year . #% Mr President , the Danish Presidency is indeed to be congratulated on its skilful handling of the negotiations which resulted in a successful outcome to the two-day summit in Brussels . #% Once again , I call on the European Commissioner for the environment , Mrs Wallström , to invoke powers under the Euratom Treaty to force an independent evaluation of the environmental risks to be carried out for the shipment of nuclear materials in the Irish Sea . #% I would like to make two suggestions . #% On the issue of committing troops to UNIFIL II , some EU countries have been generous to date . #% But I would say to you : be engaged in that election ; maintain your political conviction ; and fight the cause with those colleagues whose list you will not now head . #% Ratification would confer legitimacy on a quasi-military regime , responsible for human rights abuses , a ` flawed ' general election and nuclear proliferation . #% Studies on gender-based violence estimate that 20-25 % of all women in Europe have experienced physical acts of violence at least once during their adult lives . #% How difficult can it be for them to try to redo the French and German studies ? #% We are told that it is best left to the Member States to deal with these matters . #% It is not so long ago that the outgoing presidency refused to come to this Parliament to report on its activities because it wanted to go immediately afterwards . #% National emissions allowance capping will ensure that quantifiable Kyoto objectives are met and that we decouple economic growth from increased greenhouse gas emissions . #% The commissioning of the MOX plant when the eyes of the international media were firmly focused elsewhere in the wake of the tragedy of September 11 , 2001 is but the latest example , and is particularly serious , given the heightened concerns now of terrorist attacks . #% I would caution all interested parties against discussing broader developments within the Union before the ratification process has been comprehensively concluded within the European Union . #% In the dire situation of North Korea , we are being given an opportunity to make amends for the terrible wrong done to Poland 's prisoners . #% I should like to thank the Minister for his answer . #% Hopefully that will result in the justice that is clearly the right of stable couples , whether they be homosexual or heterosexual . #% Mr President , I think everybody in this Parliament supports the fight against terrorism . #% However , what I wish to raise is the threat from SARS that may arise in Europe in the absence of any power at European level to deal with this matter in a concerted and coordinated way . #% The EU needs to monitor what is happening carefully and be careful which sides it supports . #% The only way to guarantee that is by involving the people more directly in open fora and in communication , etc. . #% I think it was the spokesman for the PPE who raised a point that came very close to me when he talked about the rights of the victim weighed against those of the perpetrator . #% Furthermore this routine also required me coming regularly to Strasbourg on a Sunday for which I received no daily allowance . #% Although we have set the very high aspiration that within a decade we should become the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world , we are moving towards it at a lesser pace than ought to be the case . #% In the past the European Union has been criticized on the grounds that it is going to be a great melting pot in which small communities and minorities will all be lost . #% EUR 680 million of co-financed monies intended for the BMW region have gone to Dublin , the east and the south . #% Any future strategy must remain compatible with the existing framework . #% I urge the Commission to put in place immediately a cross-services task force so as to come up with concrete proposals for reforming the WTO . #% Mr President , I agree with the persons who have said that this procedure is now a bit meaningless . #% But there has to be that leap of faith , that moment in which , as a friend of mine said , we have to smile weakly and have a strong stomach and forget about the awful things we have done to each other and start to try and address the dreadful issues in the Middle East which are central to practically every single major political issue in the world today . #% Different criteria must be applied to those wishing to enter the European Union on economic grounds . #% I welcome the fact that the Commission is investigating whether or not the general good clause is being misused . #% But our clear legal advice is that this will not withstand a challenge before the European Court . #% We must therefore avoid crippling small and medium-sized European industries with over-stringent obligations and regulations . #% It is time to stop just thinking of people in terms of aid , but to start thinking in terms of people as having the enterprising ability to do things for themselves if they are given the support . #% This is unacceptable and unworkable . #% We are , per capita , the worst country as regards complaints . #% We are able to reject the fuel , but not to reject the risks when our neighbours accept it . #% It lies there , a graphic symbol , perhaps , of our sterile role in the Middle East process . #% It is disappointing , of course , that we have not succeeded in stabilising the number of people living in rural areas . #% It is important to stress one crucial point in relation to the International Fund for Ireland : this is not a European Union programme . #% I would like to commend the Commission on its SCM 2000 programme and of course , in the context of the Teverson Report I would like to thank Mr Teverson for taking on board my own Group 's amendments in committee to this report . #% The financial support that has been given , for example to the partnerships , was the very first time that we saw Republicans and Loyalists sitting down together and working at grass-roots level . #% Meat is being brought into the European Community , into the United Kingdom and other countries , and it is not being caught . #% We must take action against these people to make sure that it does not happen and to restore consumer confidence . #% I want to ask him : Does the Council intend to approve this Association Agreement if the appalling human rights abuses continue in Algeria ? #% The coastal zone requires special management . #% Despite what other people may think , some brilliant ideas come from this Parliament . #% It is time to face up to it and bury the corpse that is the EU Constitution . #% I am not satisfied - and this was confirmed to me by the Commissioner 's remarks - that EU Governments are serious about this issue . #% I am grateful for that . #% In this regard some GBP 230 million have been provided for on-farm investment under the National Development Plan . #% More importantly , the implementation of an effective traceability programme from producer to consumer is crucial to the overall success of our campaign to restore consumer confidence . #% There are new laws in place . #% At a time like this , it is always very difficult to know what balance should be struck between looking for support for a Constitution and looking for fairer debate , but the two ideas are not mutually exclusive . #% Remember it is 8 years down the line . #% Lastly , we could do what we are recommending to Parliament - accept on the grounds that no further money is forthcoming , to be realistic , but that some concessions have been made to our priorities . #% Concentration of media ownership means that enhancing the business interests of an elite minority can be disguised

In fact , the draft changes would deepen the European Union 's relationship with the nuclear armed Western European Union and pave the way for the eventual merger between the two bodies . #% Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries . #% I agree with this in the context of what I have just said . #% For us sugar is sweet , yet in Brazil the landless speak of sugar with the taste of blood . #% I have to say I disagree with Commissioner Patten in relation to the trade agreements . #% The two protagonists and their international supporters can argue interminably , and sometimes even convincingly , to justify their sides ' violence . #% I believe we could have a much greater impact on the development of the poorer countries and redirect our foreign policy in a way that we could help the poor , help to establish peace and give us real influence in the world . #% We talk about action plans for the Third World , especially with regard to children , but we never hear of any detailed plans or exact initiatives in this area . #% It is yet another undermining of the services to which Members are entitled . #% Anyone with pride in his or her own nation , who does not want to see it subsumed into a hideous conglomerate , will reject this tawdry Constitution . #% This is the kind of legislative proposal that has to stop . #% Remember : that it was not the people who created this major problem for society ; it was a lack of vision on the part of politicians and planners . #% The Commissioner will be interested to know that I had the honour of chairing a meeting last week on the issue of child pornography , organised by the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children . #% There are three points I want to raise . #% Yet , according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union , of the 43 961 members of parliaments worldwide only 16.4 % are women . #% Madam President , in relation to the enlargement reports - not just Mr Brok ' s report , but also those on the individual applicant states - it is interesting to see that Mr Brok has recognised the rejection of the Nice Treaty in Ireland . #% We await a common position from Council and Commission . #% But these brave women , the McCartney women , through refusing to be intimidated in their four-month campaign for justice for their brother and their partner , have achieved more to highlight the residual thuggery and criminality that has existed in Northern Ireland since the official IRA ceasefire than either of the two governments or the political establishment in Northern Ireland have managed to achieve in the last decade . #% However , we must continue to keep a watching brief on Hong Kong and I welcome the publication of the Commission 's recent report in that regard to which I hope we will be able to respond . #% Recently , I met with the head of the customs authorities in Ireland in Dublin Castle , and she told me that one in every five cigarettes - 20 % of the cigarettes smoked in Ireland , a small country - actually comes via China , and that when they actually seized them and analysed them , they found a mixture of tobacco and canine excrement . #% However , the growing crisis was concealed from policyholders . #% The scope of the regulation is absolutely clear on that as well : global warming reduction targets , air quality improvement . #% Firstly - and many people have mentioned this - is the whole question of the number of women at work , and this will obviously now be increased . #% This can not be allowed to happen . #% At its recent meeting in November 1998 , the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations . #% She has proposed what I think to be a convincing case to the European Convention for inclusion of this provision in an amended treaty . #% The Bilderberg meeting is starting at the weekend . #% However , one group has been completely forgotten -- the group that Hitler first attacked and continued to attack to the very end , in every concentration camp and in universities and hospitals throughout the Reich : the disabled . #% Our GDP per capita has increased from 64 % of the EU average in 1983 to 87 % last year . #% Everyone wants rural development , but in the context of beleaguered Irish farming , the only rural development I welcome is one that supports family farming , while enriching rural communities with complementary social , educational , transport and employment projects and infrastructure . #% When we talk about the failure of the Commission , we are talking about its failure to control the national governments and the regional authorities , which is not always an easy task . #% I am pleased to hear from the Commissioner for Information Technology Erkki Liikanen that the number of broadband connections doubled from 9 million in July 2002 to 17.5 million in July 2003 . #% Instead , the doors have been tightly closed to keep those countries out until the rules are changed to suit the big and wealthy countries in Europe . #% Mr President , I would like to commend the various rapporteurs and draftsmen on their excellent work on the 2003 budget . #% I ask the Council here today to answer the question properly . #% They also employ 1.4 million people . #% As such , I am impressed by the degree to which the Dess report has committed to greening CAP ; to supporting small - and medium-sized food producers ; and to looking towards the future while also addressing the current concerns which face European agriculture . #% After ten years and one previous rejection we still have not got it right . #% I very much welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency has written to the Israeli Foreign Minister expressing our deepest concern at the damage that has been done to projects funded by the European Union as a direct result of Israeli attacks against the Palestinian institutions . #% It is important that the European institutions that are directly accountable to the electorate - in other words , Parliament and the Council of Ministers - should continue to have - and be seen to have - the final decision-making authority on issues of importance to our citizens . #% If the overall social , human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be achieved then strict standards for reducing air pollution must be an imperative . #% It should not just be a matter of having vaccines in case it affects our own citizens : if there is an outbreak , we should target it wherever it occurs and try to ensure that it does not spread . #% The question of safeguarding external frontiers must be a matter for sovereign states and must be diverse as suits those states in their present circumstances and challenges . #% It is an island with predominantly westerly winds and therefore significantly protected from contamination by GMOs from neighbouring countries . #% I agree that the EU ´ s civil protection doctrine has to be founded on a ` bottom-up ' approach and that primary responsibility for civil protection activity should be with the Member States . #% But how this is to be regulated in the European Union is not so obvious . #% Mr President , there are currently over 40 million people in the world who are suffering from AIDS . #% Although I support the report , I wish to make known certain reservations pertaining to same . #% Under the current legislation , there are no clear lines of responsibility . #% From the perspective of my political group , cohesion and solidarity is our objective and we believe that it is severely undermined by chronic unemployment . #% The British , for example , are always complaining about the flags of convenience and the fact that their own government has failed to decommission and , instead , has sold off its flags of convenience to countries like Spain and France . #% So I am glad that we are now targeting cutting-edge research , particularly in areas like nano-technology , which will be very significant in the future . #% As well as obtaining agreement on the legal status of the Euro and the general principles of ERM II , the Irish presidency has maintained and deepened the momentum towards a single currency . #% However , this sort of thing should not happen in this House and we should organise our debates more efficiently . #% Mr President , waste is a major problem throughout the European Union . #% I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission . #% Will you be making proposals for it to be continued into the next programme so that they have another six years ? #% There are many elderly people who suffer from disabilities as well . #% I would also like to thank him for taking on board many of the Verts/ALE Group 's suggestions . #% Add to this the fact that our Kyoto CO2 emissions are now at 1990 levels plus 22 % already 10 % over target for 2010 , and the fact that there will be little or no decrease in car prices even if there is a removal or reduction in VRT because car manufacturers have had to reduce their prices to offset our high tax regime - and they will revert their prices if the tax burden is lightened - and you have altogether a very complicated field of play . #% These are questions that Members have already touched on . #% This report is a contribution to resolving problems in the inshore fishing sector , not to creating new ones . #% We must also end the practice of discarding vulnerable stocks . #% There is no doubt that unemployment is the major challenge that faces us in the next decade , and frankly in relative terms Europe is bad at creating jobs . #% However , I would like to see progress in a number of other areas : #% It is incumbent on the Commission and all the 15 governments of the Union also to reflect upon this result . #% 
Mr President , the Commission 's approach to this whole issue is totally inadequate . #% A straightforward redistribution of the existing resources from the structural funds and the common agricultural policy will result in the Union 's agricultural regions taking on a disproportionately large share of the cost of enlargement . #% Since it is clear that the long-term goal set out by the Fifth Environmental Action Programme would not be attained easily , the Commission has rightly decided on a step-by-step approach setting out its so-called interim environmental targets for the year 2010 . #% The EU can now vindicate its claim to a place on the world stage by brokering this strategy . #% As my colleague , Mr Andersson , rightly pointed out , there is not just one single model , but a variety of different ones . #% They have been taken together all the way through and I believe it would be more consistent to keep them together . #% What do you think such a draconian programme of cuts is going to do for trade , either in Europe or in the world ? #% The European Union will seek to protect natural resources that lie at the root of economic development , to strive for the promotion of eco-efficiency , promote the sustainable use of water land and energy as well as try and ensure that the vicious cycle of poverty and unenvironmental degradation is broken . #% Therefore , it is blindingly obvious that SMEs will play an important role if we are to resolve the very high unemployment problems that we have generally in the Union and specifically in various regions of the Union . #% This performance gives the lie to the simplistic and essentially anti-European myth that preparing for EMU necessarily entails higher unemployment and drastic cuts in public expenditure . #% I come from an island country , in which we have 35 , 000 troops also from another country in part of that island . #% It is unfortunate that the debate on whether or not to support this report has been reduced by some to a polarising of positions , a pro- and anti-US stance , or even a left versus right divide . #% The economic crisis and the crisis in the dairy sector have affected these regions disproportionately in relation to most of the rest of Europe , and that is why these regions deserve some special attention . #% The Parliament has to address human rights abuses within the Union . #% Legislation on catering waste , animal transport , animal welfare , surveillance and disease control must be properly implemented and monitored . #% Ensuring safety , while ensuring that environmental concerns are met by the sector in a responsible manner , both in reducing noise pollution and reducing the volume of emissions generated , is a primary concern . #% Many colleagues will be aware of the excellent work carried out by the Bureau in promoting protection for lesser used and minority languages . #% The same problems exist in the UK : 52 models examined in the UK are still more expensive . #% Mr President , that is my point : it should not purport to be an official magazine and should not carry the masthead or purport to represent the views of this House . #% I welcome the fact that the Council in Barcelona recognised that reality . #% Real energy alternatives are needed to combat this . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I served in the American Army in the 1950s , so I have a little knowledge of the horrors of war . #% Multinational firms will only change their behaviour when they are forced to pay heavily for their misdeeds . #% How much time and resources will be committed to detailed scrutiny of biotech inventions ? #% One key argument that has received little acknowledgement in the heated debates so far is the competitiveness case of employing Article 175 to achieve our Lisbon targets of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world , with sustainable growth as an integral part of that objective . #% There has long been a need to create a European company to complement this picture . #% Where is the justification for this directive ? #% When we discuss any issues regarding education we have to see this as an investment in the future for our young people to give them the skills to adapt to the changing technologies in the changing world in which we live . #% The most that the EU should do is to set minimum requirements to be met by voluntary eco-labelling schemes . #% I would suggest that we need reform , and we all agree on that . #% We must place emphasis on overall economic growth , but our priority must be to promote employment , more and better jobs in our European Union . #% However , turning to his reply , one of the biggest hindrances to cross-border trade and protection of the country of origin principle is the idea of a one-stop shop for registration of a company , that is if one Member State approves a company to provide that service in that Member State , it should be reciprocal in all other Member States , because the same basis for decision-making under the internal market rules should apply . #% The Council common position takes on board most of the points made by Parliament at first reading . #% Surely , the US and the European Union governments can agree on one item , and that is simply that the use of greenhouse gases depletes the ozone layer which results in higher sea levels and more coastal erosion , and affects the living environment of island communities . #% Transitional arrangements for Ireland must be adequate in terms of the level and duration of funding so as to address our continuing significant developmental needs . #% In conclusion , we should facilitate enterprises which create new jobs in rural areas , regardless of scale . #% Sharing information regarding hydrocarbons , radioactive substances and other harmful substances carried at sea and discharges into the sea which have been dumped as part of historical dumping regimes is a vital prerequisite in facilitating the preparation and coordination of any response necessary to mitigate the environmental and human health impacts of pollution incidents . #% If that is indeed so , then this must be made doubly clear in the terms of reference for the troops we send . #% For far too long the Commission or the Council , holding its meetings in secret and expressing solidarity very often between themselves about these issues , have covered up what we really need to know about future policy on immigration , asylum , refugees , etc. , within the Community . #% Commissioner , I do not know whether this is a PR exercise and we do not really want the truth to get out to those who might be listening . #% However , in other areas - oil and minerals - and in every form of jurisdiction Member States have over their oceans , natural resources fall within the remit of the national governments . #% It is my opinion , and the opinion of EPP members in the Committee on Budgets , that there are sufficient funds to meet the request of the Committee on Agriculture : if the Doyle position is accepted by this Parliament and by the Council there are sufficient resources to finance the policy . #% Then we will be in the same situation as with the tobacco companies where millions could be paid out to people whose health has been put in danger . #% In 2005 and 2006 , EUR 108 million are being allocated to this fund which is supporting projects in the border county region and Northern Ireland . #% I would ask the Commission to respond to this point in particular , and to ensure that the money be spent on a proposal to provide clean energy from North Korea 's electricity plants , by reconstructing its ancient conventional energy plants so as to make them efficient , by contributing to the proposed gas pipeline from Irkutsk as well as developing the great potential in Korea for wind and solar energy , bio-mass and geothermics . #% However , we were particularly angered by the imposition of the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in 1993 . #% Now they are all gone and we are not producing enough food fast enough to feed ourselves . #% I am very aware of the comments that Malcolm Harbour made in his speech and I agree with him , there is huge potential with regard to 3G . #% However , the Iranian Government has signed protocols to this treaty , measures which we welcome . #% Ever-closer union has failed . #% Failure to comply in one aspect of an accredited quality system has led to a major loss in confidence in BNFL overall . '' #% Progress on these issues may be hindered by developments on the ground , such as the expansion of settlements or terrorist attacks . #% There remains the outstanding difficulty about firms and sectors whose costs may dramatically increase to the point where their competitive position could be destroyed . #% It is also quite interesting when looked at in another way : of all the scientists and inventors that have ever existed , 92 % are living today . #% We ought to redouble all our efforts so as to be sure that next year 's world summit is up to the challenge of ensuring that development takes place in a sustained manner and also in a manner which protects existing communities . #% Will the President-in-Office take steps to ensure that it is not absorbed into national or regional statutory structures but is seen by those agencies as an important but independent development programme ? #% Not our Charlie ! #% It is clear , however , that the EU 's ambition is to garner that role to itself . #% They will prevent the remuneration of donors in any circumstances and preclude importation of plasma and plasma products from paid donors . #% We can also acknowledge that the Court of Auditors plays a role in assisting the Commission to identify weaknesses in its administration and difficulties which it may not have observed in the way Member States implement our various schemes . #% Following on what Mr Schiedermeier has said , it is important to recognize that we can protect workers ' rights and social entitlement , but that does not mean we have to add on more bureaucracy and red tape . #% We must focus on simplifying and establishing a supportive regulatory-environment framework which encourages entrepreneurship and reduces this bureaucracy and red tape . #% Not to do so will I believe be perceived as a considerable set-back . #% Mr President , I also wish to join in this debate on the candidature of the President-designate , Mr Barroso . #% As was saying , it is important that we reflect on what has taken place . #% All these systems should be linked to a modern rail network with up-to-date rolling stock . #% 
Today we can see that we provide here , in Europe , almost half of the IFI 's annual budget . #% In the resolution before us today we call on the Chinese Government to abide by the moratorium adopted at international level . #% We must not forget that the business of agriculture is about producing food in the first place and we must ensure that food is safe . #% Mr President , now the vote is over , I would like to come back to the issue of a quorum . #% Now , Mr President , I hope you will allow an English-speaker to talk to you in French to suggest that the language of Molière might be enriched by a new and typically European concept , that of ` berthelisme ' , which means having a fictitious job paid for out of European taxpayers ' money . #% We now have , in the Buitenweg report , a unique opportunity to see those efforts incorporated into a package of legislation and an action plan . #% Madam President , my point concerns the section of the Minutes on Question Time yesterday evening , when I raised a point of order . #% Is it proportionate ? #% He must see the clear link between the necessary loan and aid packages , which are vital to the country 's economic well-being , and the democratic and constitutional reforms which we all expect of him . #% It is an issue of interest , not only to the European Union , but to the world and those who want to see Macau and Hong Kong progress , so that basic freedoms are guaranteed and are not eroded by the country to which they have been handed back . #% I believe in the principle of equality between small and large Member States . #% Could you confirm or deny that specifically ? #% We often see change as something that is always desirable but that can wait until tomorrow . #% It is inappropriate to seek to use budgetary procedure as a means of shaping that policy . #% The groundwork has been done and I commend you , Mr President , for your leadership and enthusiasm for the European project and also the Commission and the Danish presidency for their efficiency in dealing with this unprecedented project . #% Firstly , and perhaps most importantly , this report must set the agenda for Parliament and must be a guide for Parliament when it tries to influence both the Commission and the Council with regard to the direction they should be taking on thematic issues and the priority the European Union gives to human rights . #% Mr President , it is a very great pleasure for me and my Irish UEN colleagues to welcome here the Taoiseach , Mr Ahern , our political party leader , as President-in-Office of the Council . #% The new Israeli Prime Minister , Mr Barak , has put in place a government with a sufficiently strong majority to allow him to resume negotiations in the peace process with adequate parliamentary support for his declared intention to get the peace process moving forward again . #% What I would suggest is that if we as a Community decide that nets may not be used , then the people who are prevented from engaging in the legitimate practice of catching tuna fish with nets should get compensation . #% In each country there are balance of payments difficulties , but quite encouraging growth figures in all three . #% As such , these SMEs are the driving force of European job creation . #% Equality legislation alone will not succeed in tackling the deep-rooted inequalities that exist without the political will of politicians , of policymakers and others to grasp the nettle and comprehensively tackle discrimination . #% It recommends that the State Parties to the Geneva Conventions ( which includes Ireland ) should prosecute those responsible for these policies and their implementation . #% In this way consumers can continue to have a high level of protection without hampering the functioning and development of wireless technologies . #% They should be liable for any damage caused by such releases and they should be required to take out liability insurance just as every driver has to take out liability insurance in case he kills or injures another human being . #% Therefore , if Ireland were to ratify the Schengen Agreement without the United Kingdom , we would impose new restrictions on the movement of Irish people which would create great difficulties . #% The aim is life-long learning ; to produce a new type of specialist graduate equipped with superior rural development , advisory and management skills . #% Ways of strengthening the entrepreneurial , technical and vocational dimensions of second level curriculum must also receive particular attention in the context of assisting SMEs in the future . #% Downstream users of chemicals , which include the vast majority of SMEs , will benefit significantly from this information . #% . -- Mr President , what continues in Burma is appalling . #% We had a very difficult debate about this in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , and I congratulate the rapporteur on seeking to establish a consensus , which I believe will carry the report with a great majority here . #% Surely , a transport manager will not want to keep ten buses on the road if one bus will transport the passengers available . #% I served on Mr Davignon 's panel and it is certainly consistent with the panel 's views . #% They also want to focus on the external implications of employment and social policies , particularly in relation to the enlargement process . #% It is vital that these successes are now accompanied by further measures which strengthen democratic control , protect the rights of consumers and fully inform ordinary people about the changeover to the single currency so that the prophets of doom will not be proved right . #% These documents , the first of which is actually a legally-binding treaty which has been signed by the EU and all Member States , calls for measures which are more progressive than those which the Commission is requesting . #% He may feel that his efforts in this agreement are wasted and not appreciated . #% Yesterday I had a question down to the Commission and today I have a similar one to the Council . #% A package of integrated financial measures needs to be deployed in order to press ahead with implementation of the network . #% I hope this Parliament , the media and the public will recognise his tremendous record in not only completing his legislative programme but bringing Parliament along in support when people said it could not be done . #% It shows us standing up for the common good and rejecting the very well-financed , and at times , almost threatening campaigns of the tobacco lobby and of the medium moguls . #% From an ethical point of view , it can no longer be accepted by the EU institutions . #% The International Fund for Ireland was established by the British and Irish Governments in 1986 with the objective of promoting economic and social advance and encouraging contact , dialogue and reconciliation between the Unionists and Nationalists throughout Ireland . #% The Stern report is quite explicit on the economic savings that can be made with regard to energy efficiency . #% Like him , I am pleased that we have a result , although I recommend acceptance with a rather heavy heart . #% This is essential because , by following the road of incineration , any incentive to reduce and look at alternative ways of dealing with the reduction of waste is destroyed . #% I respect politically why you say that but it shows scant regard and little understanding for the due process in this Parliament . #% Would it mean more financial support ? #% At last we dare to hope that lasting peace can now be guaranteed democratically . #% Of course he is a German politician , but the German Government is empowered and in a position to speak for Germany . #% Mr President , the Århus Convention , signed by all 25 Member States , gives the public rights in the three areas of accessing environmental information , participating in environmental decision-making and accessing justice in environmental matters . #% I say this because the safety of nuclear plants in Eastern and Central Europe has been a cause for great concern in recent years , and will continue to be . #% However , as the Commissioner responsible for enlargement , he does not now have the luxury of speaking in a personal capacity . #% I welcome the comments of the rapporteur emphasising the need to develop farm holidays . #% I thank the Commissioner for his usual , very comprehensive reply . #% He has committed himself to that and I hope he will . #% One of the most important aspects of the social aspect of globalisation is education , because no matter how many trade issues you deal with or how many preferential trade deals you give to developing countries , the people in those countries will never be able to climb out of the pit of poverty to which so many of them are consigned unless they are given proper access to education and healthcare and an understanding of how systems operate . #% I particularly commend the rapporteur for encouraging the authorities in BiH to pursue wanted war crimes perpetrators and bring them to justice . #% The Jean Monnet programme has been successful in achieving some of these objectives within the European Union itself . #% The European Union does have an important political role to play in re-starting the peace process in the Middle East ; it could certainly be seen to play a role as an honest broker in the region . #% The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves , which have been totally rejected out of hand , for the conservation of their own fish stocks , then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard . #% The Commission puts a lot of emphasis on ` working with the market ' . #% Madam President , I was a journalist at the height of the BSE crisis , so I have very vivid memories of the unfolding of that story and its impact not just on politicians but on consumer confidence . #% However , I am not convinced on the second point , despite the Commissioner 's protestations on many occasions that we have played our WTO cards wisely . #% At the same time , they have been given an impossible task to try and square a circle that can not be squared . #% We have some concerns in relation to deadlines . #% 
I turn to the Council , Commission and Parliament : if we believe in democracy -- especially in this process that you , Mr President , called the most important since the founding of the Union -- I entreat you to do whatever you can to ensure a fair and free process , to ensure that resources are used to truly inform people , especially by distributing copies of the Constitution to all the electorate , and by ensuring that all sides of the debate are thoroughly aired . #% There are now nine Council members around the transport table who are prepared to ask for a study . #% I know the Commissioner has said that it is up to national governments and that the banks are not subject to Regulation ( EC ) No 2560/01 , but surely it should be possibly to introduce regulations to ban these surcharges . #% Finally , I wish to pay tribute to the Commissioner . #% One of the things which concerns me very much is the fact that when we have had phenomenal growth rates , these have not converted into employment . #% All too often in these architectural situations everybody goes by the textbook , and when you look and ask a disabled person afterwards what the textbook solution is like , firstly , invariably it is more expensive than what disabled people want themselves , and , secondly , it is actually not right for what they require themselves . #% We must give greater attention to enforcing the highest possible safety level for patients , in particular , as many speakers have already said , for vulnerable women . #% Her efforts , I have to say , have sadly not been helped by the failure of the Council to achieve an outcome in this area and , indeed , an unanimous agreement . #% I would like to comment on the recommendations in the report that a tax be imposed on arms exports . #% So , what do we have to do ? #% Mr President , ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today . #% So I hope the Commission takes note that the instruments are there by which we could carry out testing and make sure that the harmonisation of homeopathic medicinal products with therapeutic indications is properly tested . #% Root and branch changes are essential , in which the primacy of the nation state should be reestablished and Brussels centralisation reversed , with wide-ranging powers repatriated to national governments and parliaments . #% However , the Commissioner for Consumer Affairs , Mrs Bonino , together with national governments must put in place comprehensive information campaigns relating specifically to the pricing of products in the euro and the national currency of the host Member State in the run up to EMU . #% Some of the hardest criminals are turning witness and are now offered very lenient sentences . #% After all , the European agricultural model is supposed to be about their survival . #% We do not want to see a situation where a limitless patent system can be abused by large operatives to stifle technical competition or , even worse , prevent the publication of information . #% And last but not least , I would strongly request that smaller Member States should retain the right to appoint one Member to the European Commission . #% Schengen allowed for full implementation in the countries subscribing to the Single Act , especially as regards the free movement of persons . #% They have long working hours in difficult circumstances with little or no recognition in terms of government policy to the serious difficulties they are encountering . #% Madam President , Commissioner , when we in Ireland signed up for economic and monetary union , we accepted the central tenet of economic and monetary union , namely closer coordination of economic and budgetary policies of Member States . #% On the contrary , it may be observed that there is a clear relationship between the quality of the environment and the wealth of a nation . #% On behalf of Mr Poettering , the leader of the PPE-DE Group , on my own behalf , and particularly on behalf of my colleagues in the Irish delegation , I would like to pledge our fullest support to them in their courageous , dignified and determined pursuit of justice for their brother Robert 's brutal murder . #% The European Union has a resource which we hand out without cost or charge to our fishermen , and we extend that resource through these agreements . #% A higher rate would mean a higher cut in direct payments and therefore in farm incomes . #% Mr President , I love the word ` democracy ' because it puts the word ` people ' in front of the word ` rule ' -- government by the people , of the people , for the people . #% General Morillon , here this afternoon , served at Srebrenica and other places with dignity , despite having a very difficult and effectively impossible UN mandate . #% If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do . #% Even if there is very low probability of risk , we damage both consumer confidence and producer confidence . #% These ideas can be used by all to further the science and to drive progress . #% Under the regulation establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture , the Commission is obliged to report at least every three years to Parliament , the Council and the Community bodies representing the sector on the implementation of measures and developments in the common fisheries policy . #% I believe these moves should be highly praised and that this is the way we should proceed as well . #% Mr Patten may forget , we will not forget . #% Commissioner Patten was right to emphasise the contribution that the EU as a whole and the EU Commission in particular have made during the last year . #% Any suggestions from any quarter that Ireland should suffer as a result of the success of the Irish economy is a very serious threat . #% Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , President-designate of the Commission and nominee Commissioners , you are very welcome to our Chamber this afternoon and we look forward to our hearings and our various communications over the next few weeks and eventually months and years . #% We want to enact a new Treaty that will command the support of the people of Europe and which will oversee the smooth running of the European Union for the next 50 years . #% This unfortunately now leaves this area to the dictates of the interests of the more powerful states on the world stage and fails to provide a political presence and role for European values . #% Mr Howitt mentioned the Commission and its commitment to bringing forward a directive by the end of the year . #% In this context , I welcome the recent decision by the Turkish parliament to adopt a constitutional reform package to bring Turkey further in line with the acquis communautaire . #% I wish to thank the Prime Minister for his contribution here this morning . #% We must allow regions to choose whether they wish to be GM and we must protect those which do not . #% By sticking to the Montreal Convention and the ECAC figures I hope we have been able to find and bring forward a balanced report that will hopefully find a way forward . #% That is one of the major problems . #% We believe that murder is no solution to political conflict and that we must do everything we can to ensure a political settlement . #% The Council seems bent , unfortunately , on ignoring wider public opinion in Europe and around the world , which is in favour of a more careful and precautionary approach to fishing , and is choosing to bow to the pressure of the fishing industry . #% The health of people , especially of children , is being put at risk in our countries in Europe and the health action plan in its present form is not equipped truly to protect us . #% We have to look at the root causes of why the waste is there in the first place . #% I welcome your commitment to take action in the social services and health area . #% At this point I would like to make clear that this report does not deal with hunting in Europe . #% So how much are airlines making on this ? #% As a public representative for the east coast of Ireland , I am at all times conscious of the threat posed to my constituents and our environment from nuclear installations on the other side of the Irish Sea , in particular the outdated , decrepit and accident-prone Sellafield plant in Cumbria . #% Whether we are talking about Potsdam , Hungary , Gdańsk , Siberia , Spain , Portugal or Ireland , those who have tried to impose their will on others have always failed , because the very essence of our humanity is the desire to be free to ensure that we can live and interact with others . #% We also have to be aware of the substantial support given to the industry in the United States . #% In view of our history , I am perhaps a little more liberal in my thinking about these particular issues . #% The urgency is clearly illustrated by one extraordinary statistic : 20 million tonnes of fish are being discarded worldwide every year , equivalent to about one quarter of total world catches . #% This is a defeat for families with young babies . #% Please forgive my German accent , but I would not dare quote Bismarck in English . #% Life is not a commodity that can be bought and sold . #% The EU is not adhering to the precautionary principle , as it is supposed to . #% I will support the truth that the fundamental rights of the human person are from God . #% It is not going to be possible to ensure the free and fast flow of goods and people around the continent , or indeed on the island of Ireland , unless we have fast , efficient , safe and comfortable rail services , not only to and from our major urban centres , but also to provide cohesion in those parts of our continent whether there is underdevelopment . #% I would also sincerely thank him for the Berlin Resolution in this area . #% Mr President , following Mr Farage 's comments , I note that this is the first time ever that UKIP will vote with the Communists ! #% I have taken steps to try to inform myself as to the equivalence that exists among governments and among national parliaments . #% The majority of farmers are in that network . #% 
Offhand I can recall only one instance where the UN moved from a peacekeeping simpliciter to an operation with an element of peace enforcing and that was in Sudan several years ago and , by all accounts , it was an unhappy and unsuccessful intervention . #% I find it impossible to work on that basis . #% If we get , as expected , an increase as a result of conciliation more money will , of course , be asked for next year . #% However , Dr Shipman was not struck off for malpractice and he was never identified as a problem by the UK 's own regulatory body . #% Eight million people are affected with Alzheimer 's in the EU , so in effect the EU has spent less than 13 Belgian francs on each sufferer . #% I come from a country where we have the fewest forests in the European Union . #% I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Hatzidakis , on his report . #% Mr President , how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental . #% Frankly , if we are to give these coastal communities a chance to survive , there is only one probable long-term answer : get tough , bring in quantitative restrictions . #% A wholehearted response is required . #% This was despite the very low incidence of BSE in the province and our excellent traceability system , which is better than anywhere else in the whole European Union . #% It is also only right that we as a European Parliament , as the directly-elected representatives of the European people , should be seen to give leadership in relation to the way the discussions and the debate should take place in the Member States . #% Mr President , the unanimous sign-off of this emissions trading directive in December 2002 at the Council of Ministers was a major wake-up call to corporate Europe and a signal that this was actually going to happen . #% in writing . - The European Social Fund ( ESF ) is the EU 's main budgetary instrument to help social and labour market integration . #% I agree with those who say we should use the electronic system , as it is much quicker . #% When we look at the conflicts around the world we must realise that the production and sale of arms is one of the major factors contributing to global insecurity . #% You must therefore ensure that the Seville conclusions at least include a declaration that Nice does not in any way modify the Irish policy of military neutrality , currently defined as non-membership of mutual defence pacts . #% They must be able to innovate , write and develop lines of code and produce software processes without violating or breaking patent law . #% What new action can now be taken to encourage and achieve this objective ? #% In addition , Question Time did not start at the time stated on the agenda . #% Mr President , about 20 years ago I was talking to an elderly gentleman about the generation gap . #% Given that the Commission and the Council had already accepted that this was a necessity and had already agreed to set up the inter-university programme in Venice , this should be supported . #% Incineration of PVC makes the problem even worse , as apart from the risk of dioxin formation the hazardous residues resulting from PVC incineration may even exceed the quantities of PVC put into incineration . #% One of the reasons why , particularly in our inner cities and in our more disadvantaged areas , people turn to drugs is because of the old saying ` the devil finds work for idle hands ' . #% On a humanitarian basis , I want to ask you why you wrote this letter to Mr Howard . #% It is only right and proper that this matter of taxation is left in the domain of Member States , which must have the final say as to what taxation policies , at local or national level , it wishes to pursue . #% These are aspects that need to be addressed . #% As well as that , there is a need for transparency , because commercial confidentiality means this subject will remain secret . #% When I protested and demanded the release of some CWI colleagues , the police themselves told me that it was preventive arrest , preventive detention . #% Not enough European small and medium-sized enterprises grow into world-beaters . #% We in the European Union have set India a bad example and I would also like this House to condemn the transfer of civil nuclear technology to third countries . #% It is already prohibited in catfoods so there are serious question marks hanging over it . #% I want to congratulate my colleague , Mr Hyland , for the work he has put into this report and to say to him that I strongly support it . #% What we find out from our investigation will be key for the future . #% One option to reform the European Union budget which is not acceptable is the renationalising of the common agricultural policy back into the remit of the individual Member States . #% We must push out the frontiers of research but in an open and transparent way . #% With citizens seeking less Europe , this House and our guest today arrogantly demand more Europe , more EU competences , more majority voting , more centralisation , more and more and more ! #% More than 12 Members were opposed to the oral addition to Amendment No 1 #% What needs to be done to enable us to respond as we should ? #% I would call on the Irish Minister for Justice to do just that , because trafficking is a terrible abuse . #% I note with interest that in the final text of the Declaration issued by EU Heads of State , they say `` The European Union is a success story but 50 years on , however , the Union stands at a crossroads , a defining moment in its existence '' . #% It is about channelling our precious resources for research into producing weapons that are going to cause conflict in other parts of the world . #% Finally , I would like to say to this Parliament , to my colleagues and friends , that despite the best efforts of those in this House who have been trying to confuse the issue of the Treaty of Nice in relation to my country , the Irish people totally support enlargement . #% I support the framework programme being brought forward by the European Commission to combat the traffic in human beings by developing effective cooperation across the European Union in judicial procedures in this regard , and also by establishing closer links with the accession countries . #% Secondly , I have made it very clear that the White Paper on Foreign Policy , published by the Irish Government earlier this year , said that if a suitable opportunity arose in the course of the IGC the Irish Government would seek an improvement in the status of Irish in the Union and that Members could therefore take it that we would also take a similar attitude to other languages . #% Secondly , they do not have the same access to training which would allow them to keep up with the new technologies , with new economic forecasting to enable them to be competitive within the main markets . #% Both committees have done excellent work . #% Thankfully the measures put in place are proving their effectiveness and there is now an acute awareness on the part of all involved , from producers to processors , from the retail to the catering trade , that any breach of the regulations is unacceptable and will be severely dealt with . #% That has a life of its own and needs an adequate fund of its own ; hence my disappointment at the cut in the budget for rural development . #% The experience of the last six months suggests that there is a strong case for preserving the present system of rotating the Council presidency . #% Well done , Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel . #% This is hard to credit . #% Some kind of balance sheet that would bring this into some sort of reasonable focus is needed . #% Considering that the net cost has been of this order every year , it is staggering just how much of our national resources we have poured into the black hole of Europe . #% This region represents one of the most intensively industrialised areas of the world where chemical , radioactive and hydrocarbon materials are routinely discharged into the marine environment and carried by cargo ships . #% Let me take as one example the preparatory action for security research , of enormous interest to the citizens of Europe . #% You urged the Irish Government to pursue the issue at EU level instead of simply under the OSPAR . #% We need open and honest dialogue and need to look to ourselves internally first . #% However , in Ireland we refuse to be cast in the role of villain because of one or two high-profile relocations in recent years . #% Agents will still find a way of getting round that . #% If BNFL has problems in discharging radioactive products such as technetium 99 , it should store such waste materials on land in Britain as opposed to dumping them in the Irish Sea . #% Keeping the word ` safety ' in the title of the authority will give a clear signal to consumers as to its purpose and goals . #% The vet is in the front line of surveillance for indigenous and exotic diseases . #% He would have wanted to have been here to witness the mature and responsible way in which this Parliament is building a consensus on behalf of our citizens for the opening of the market on services . #% In Ireland we have the scandal relating to the beef export refunds and the continuing massive transit fraud in , for example , cigarette smuggling . #% I do not find this acceptable . #% 
We must not confuse terrorism with peaceful protests , with legal and lawful protests by the citizen . #% We can now seek to amend this proposal by referring it back to the Development Committee , and I very much appreciate the work done by the Presidency and those in the Commission who proposed a new draft . #% I urge the IGC not to step back from it . #% If the Commission can be blamed for anything it is for failing to do its own public relations work , to stand up for itself and to stand up to the national governments when they are in breach of the regulations . #% How will the external impact of the industry strategy be evaluated ? #% However , it does not address the unemployment question or the downside , negative aspects of the abolition of duty-free in terms of airports , airlines and , indeed , shipping companies that are already under severe pressure . #% The very best response , apart from the obvious security measures that we have to take , is to defend our ideas of freedom , of democracy , of justice and of ending exploitation . #% Serial hijacking of huge consignments of cigarettes is acknowledged to be the work of the IRA . #% Ireland has no energy recovery or incineration facilities so all our targets have to be met through recycling alone . #% Would he agree that there are already an increasing number of Irish people who speak the language and that the number of people being educated through Gaeilge in Ireland has increased dramatically , particularly over the last 20 years ? #% Even then , they will still be highly radioactive for more than 50 years . #% Mr President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo , Mexico , Saudi Arabia , Sierra Leone and China . #% Let us learn some lessons and let us address that critical part of the mandate . #% Those we are making agreements with have to appreciate that we are serious . #% It also fully supports the establishment of a solid legal framework for the European Environmental Economic Accounts as a positive step in the ` GDP and beyond ' process , and , indeed , welcomes the Commission initiative to present an index for environmental pressure , to be submitted alongside GDP . #% We are told they will increase by 40 % on current rates . #% I made a proposal in my speech which was not recorded because I had not realized that the Vice-President had asked for silence and I went on speaking . #% I know it is of concern not only to Danish Members but to the House generally . #% This will actually encourage more animal testing . #% Mr President , it is difficult to make any real contribution to the services directive debate in a two-minute time-slot . #% . I congratulate the rapporteurs , Ms Pack and Ms Prets , for their thorough work on the important issues of European policy in the areas of youth , education and training . #% We are here as representatives of states , all of which have failed to implement a directive that they freely entered into not more than two years ago . #% The continuing occupation of Palestinian territory and the construction of the so-called security wall , mostly on Palestinian territory , is ghettoising Palestinians , destroying their livelihoods , imprisoning and impoverishing them and driving them to despair . #% This is contrary to the views of the British Royal Society , which finds that the scientific case has not been made . #% However , this report and these proposals indicate that our poorest regions could win twice over from enlargement , with a bigger internal market and a continuation of regional aid . #% I particularly welcome the fact that the second phase of Socrates places such an emphasis upon promoting knowledge of EU languages . #% I said it will raise the antennae of Mrs Van Dijk when she hears that and when I saw her name up to make a statement . #% In conclusion , the main obstacle at this point is diplomatic . #% It accepts modulation while differentiating between advantaged and disadvantaged regions and , therefore , will give better compensation for poorer regions - and this is welcome . #% That was my wish , but I accept that a charter is a little more realistic . #% The money has to be taken into account to a greater extent in the future , and we can not pretend otherwise . #% Finally , we remain concerned about the fight against fraud in the Union , an issue with serious potential to undermine the institutions . #% And I would just ask the Commission to bear in mind that if it really believes that labour costs are the main potential factor for driving up inflation it will be making bad policy decisions . #% In particular , this is the case for Open Source and the Open Source movement that has been so successful in recent years . #% But I can assure the Member that , in relation to the working of the single market and the free movement of people , the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will consider the point raised . #% Consumers must once again be convinced that beef is a wholesome food . #% author . - Mr President , I support calls for the end of the death penalty in China , more especially when the death penalty is used to terrorise minority ethnic groups and nations within the Chinese state . #% If we undertook sensible policies , there are three things we could do which would almost eliminate the problem of climatic change . #% One of the key components which must be enshrined within all liberalisation or competition law in this area is the question of universal access for all , so that no matter where anybody is living they have the same access as somebody living in a large urbanised area . #% However , the related budgetary payments will be settled within the current limits of the overall ceiling previously agreed for actual expenditure , that is payment appropriations . #% I would hope that the Commissioner present today will fight the case for consumers and for citizens who want to see the whole waste disposal and landfill issue dealt with in an environmentally friendly way . #% They too deserve serious consideration in the ongoing reforms . #% It is a `` yes '' to make sure that we meet the political conditions agreed in Helsinki that we in the EU should be ready , no later than the end of 2002 , for this historic journey towards enlargement . #% I am sure in your discussions with Bob Zurlik you will remind him of that . #% The Committee on Development was unanimous in supporting the following key principles . #% There are major issues at stake . #% I want to thank Parliament for debating this issue . #% The follow-up to the Commission 's Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men 2006-2010 must take into consideration the long-term consequences of the economic crisis and climate change in a society that is getting older and ethnically more diverse . #% It is worth noting that European investment in Burma is significant , particularly in the oil and gas industries . #% In relation to the second part of the honourable Member 's question , I will bring her comments to the attention of the President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers . #% It is good to remember that Europe has shared a common position throughout its history regarding the importance of supporting and protecting family and marriage . #% I pay tribute to the efforts of those local people , sometimes in impossible circumstances . #% From an Irish perspective , I can inform colleagues that work is well under way to achieve this aim . #% These amendments have already been approved by the JURI and FEMM Committees . #% It seems to me that a small family-owned farm , for example , which we could take as a base for rural development , etc. , is greatly endangered by the new movement that is occurring at the moment . #% Mr President , although the current round of multilateral trade negotiations has been going on since 2001 , the ambition to conclude them this year looks increasingly unobtainable , certainly if we judge it by the incremental effect of Hong Kong . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mr Collins on his excellent report and indeed for accepting my amendments on the health aspects of air travel . #% This sends out a very bad signal . #% We must ensure that Iraq is approached in a multilateral way . #% In conclusion , the historical legacy of Irish economic migration throughout the world in the past two centuries , particularly during and after our Irish potato famine of 1845-1849 is one which we as Irish Europeans should not ignore . #% Taxation of companies is the exclusive responsibility of each Member State . #% I am also really concerned about the question of exports from Palestine and the difficulties many producers are still experiencing when trying to export their goods - and I understand fully the need for security and everything else - because of an excessive amount of rather exigent security checks at the border . #% Just to wave taxes as a threat , without matching them with grants for retrofitting older plants so that they can comply with acceptable emission standards , and without generally increasing investment in monitoring emissions , will not work . #% Apart from blood and blood products , it will also cover the whole area of patients donating their own blood prior to surgery in hospitals and cover regulation in that area specifically as well . #% In this regard , is it not imperative to guarantee two things : first , to guarantee that the case against the Constitution is not suppressed in a welter of one-sided propaganda emanating from the European institutions and , secondly , that the democratic referendum process is not distorted by unbalanced funding from external sources ? #% The Environmental Committee will continue to play an important coordinating role in this regard and I would congratulate the rapporteur on the report . #% 
Without that we would not have had this result , which I trust will bring forward a directive that will work . #% It is not only on the Internet that these things circulate . #% For the 21st century our motto should be giving our citizens the tools to cooperate and to work within the new Europe . #% I welcome the appointment of Jean Claude Trichet and wish him well in his onerous duties as head of the ECB . #% There are legitimate concerns , because sometimes sales below cost can be abused to squeeze out competitors by means of predatory pricing ; this does not help small business , nor does it help the consumer . #% European Union airlines , consumer groups and air crew workers must all work together to guarantee that all public health issues concerning air travel are fully addressed . #% The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs . #% In relation to the access to medical and veterinary products for horses , we also have to take into account the whole issue of animal welfare problems . #% My views on the present hushkit legislation are on the record . #% It is not , as the rapporteur says , a substitute for the fundamental rights systems of the Member States but a complement to them . #% In the report there are a number of very important improvements in relation to consumers and consumer information . #% My fear with regard to this is that monies that are badly needed for the Irish naval service to upgrade its fleet and to cover 140 , 000 square miles of territorial waters , not only protecting the Irish coastline but also protecting a European frontier and European fishing ground , would be diverted into some other area . #% In my view , it should be brought forward in Seville . #% The transboundary nature of the marine environment , which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region , leads to the need for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution . #% It is important that the citizens of Europe are involved in decisions that are taken at a European Union level . #% The aim of the proposal is to add a further , simpler , method of spending the European Social Fund , so that its contribution to addressing the economic and social challenges facing Europe during the crisis can be faster and more effective . #% One of the tasks between now and December , if we choose to postpone this matter - as was the view of the majority of the Conference of Presidents - would be to invite the President of the Court of Auditors to undertake an extensive investigation as to whether it was to the Court or another institution that the leak could be traced . #% I strongly welcome the initiative taken by my government which has commissioned a study into the possible use of new and alternative forms of waste generation and disposal . #% I am also especially supportive of references in this common position compromise which identify marine sciences and technologies as a cross-cutting scientific priority . #% All EU countries and an encouragingly ever-increasing number of other states have signed up to the ILO conventions on the minimum age for employment and on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour . #% But for us to agree to that , and for our representatives in the Convention to go along that line would require some faith from our point of view that we would be given more powers and consulted on a wider basis by the Commission and the Council when they look at these issues in the future . #% Bringing the measure into line with the long-established vehicle type approval system will also maintain the competitiveness and ensure the compliance of European car manufacturers . #% Some 9 000 people from cross-community groups have been involved in these projects for creating jobs in Northern Ireland and some 5 000 people have been involved in the cross-border projects . #% As a directly elected representative of the people , I believe that we could go a long way to giving a more human face to the institutions of the European Union if we successfully promoted the work of these bodies to our constituents . #% I emphasize , however , that it is not a question of diverting existing resources . #% This report , prepared by the Director of the US-based Institute for Research and Security Studies , accuses the United Kingdom nuclear installation inspectors of not taking a serious accident at Sellafield seriously enough and of not having an emergency plan . #% This ideological debate , however , must not take away from the immediate concern of assisting the Japanese people in every way possible to recover from this disaster . #% It is illogical given the huge variation in size of nuclear programmes . #% You briefly mentioned environmental issues and you should take this opportunity to ensure that all the outstanding complaints against Ireland in relation to breaches of EU law are addressed and resolved . #% It relegates national parliaments to mere consultative sounding boards ; it trades meaningful democracy for the pseudo-democracy of this House ; it neuters the last defence of the nation-state by increasingly supplanting the national veto with radically increased qualified majority voting ; and it provides an unbridled path to further integration by permitting amendment by heads of government rather than by the people . #% Mr President , in today 's world it is clear that consumers are more informed and more demanding . #% I extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , my colleague , Mr Moreira Da Silva , for the enormous body of work that he did in bringing all of us to where we are today . #% Mrs Roth-Behrendt did not keep to the subject . #% And whether that means imposing sanctions on all involved until they end their war or offering advantage to those who end it , we who have the capability must act . #% I did not support amendments which failed to recognise the positive developments in relation to care for older people . #% It is essential that annual reports are submitted by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council , as is specified . #% Mrs President , on a point of order , every single month I find myself left out of Question Time , even though I am in the first 12 or 13 questions . #% He has to go eight miles before he can find a telephone to communicate with anybody . #% We would not need a regulation of this kind if it were not for the fact that every year in Europe over 500 000 passengers are affected by cancellations and the denial of boarding . #% In conclusion , it is imperative that the Doha development round gets back on track if there is to be any hope of lifting millions in the developing world out of poverty . #% Current estimates show that bushmeat is being consumed on a massive scale across the humid tropics , particularly in Africa . #% These are issues which we need to address . #% I believe that when dealing with many of the petitions , especially those relating to abduction of children , speed is of the essence . #% I believe that responsibility for development has to remain within the remit of the Development Commissioner , who needs to push for better policy coherence , especially as regards trade , common agriculture and fisheries policies . #% The eastern European countries are being misled by those EU leaders who maintain that the `` no '' vote in Ireland was a `` no '' to enlargement . #% Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and can not , object to that . #% Let us hope that this will be at the Berlin summit in March . #% It sets out a framework for the prohibition of discrimination on these grounds and establishes a uniform minimum level of protection within the European Union for people who have suffered such discrimination . #% Deficits must be steadily reduced over the coming years , as the economy recovers from the effects of the financial crisis , but growing our way out of the crisis is the only effective option to secure long-term fiscal sustainability and protect citizens . #% I very much welcome Mr Poos ' report and very much hope that when it receives overwhelming support from Parliament , as I believe it will , the Belgian Presidency will convey the importance of the report to the Council of Ministers . #% I just want to make a technical announcement before we start voting . #% But the current EU policy is doing them a disservice by continually holding out hopes that there are fish available for them somewhere . #% Mr President , the fisheries protocol with the Republic of Mauritania is of vital importance for EU fisheries . #% I thank the Commissioner for her reply . #% However , there needs to be a major rethink about fleet policy . #% This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future . #% When negotiating EU-ACP agreements it is essential to stress the need for simplification and rationalization of aid instruments with a view to gradual evolution towards direct budgetary support for ACP countries . #% It is unfair , disingenuous and indeed misleading to say that those who oppose funding for stem cell research are preventing the discovery of cures for serious illnesses . #% In conclusion , we must open our arms and welcome the rejuvenation that the arrival of the countries from central and eastern Europe will bring about . #% I should like to refer to what my friend Mr Casaca said about the appropriation by the European Union of the fish of Greenland . #% Mr President , you have anticipated the point of order I wished to make . #% Such projects should not only be open to the business sector and local groups such as small locally-based co-ops should be assisted in creating such local enterprises . #% We need science to rule here and we need scientific risk assessments of the level of adventitious protein sources in feed . #% The EU must therefore look at ways of encouraging banks to lend whilst ensuring that the mechanisms put in place by the EU to support SMEs are accessible . #% Could the Defence Minister of the incoming Presidency come to this House at an early date and make a statement to us ? #% in writing . - Having visited Gaza earlier this year , I have seen in person how vital it is that Parliament acts in this area . #% 
It must be said that the Commission is to be congratulated on the speed with which it responded to the crisis and in particular the way in which it cooperated with NGOs in the region . #% Patents on human bodies , on human cloning , on embryos and on altering the human germ line are all banned in the draft from the Legal Affairs Committee . #% We can not protect people from themselves , nor should we legislate for all life 's risks . #% I believe that the Summit will make a significant difference in key areas such as water and energy . #% When Yasser Arafat was the leader of the Palestinian people , Israel said it could not deal with him , it could not negotiate with him . #% It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations . #% This is an area of great concern . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for the positive reply to my question . #% Mr President , I can understand the reasoning behind not being able to do it electronically , because you can not check whether everyone uses their card . #% We must do all we can to attract young men and women to the sector in order to ensure its continuity . #% In my own Member State , Ireland , for example , there is no law governing embryonic stem cell research . #% I can join with the honourable Member in expressing absolute condemnation of this arrest and arrests of this kind . #% Be that as it may , the harsh reality is that farmers who are guarantors of food supply and quality are devastated , their incomes eliminated and the ethos of farming desecrated through the destruction of a prime food product . #% The enlargement of the Union is the number one policy priority of all key European Union legislators . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , I would also like to thank the Commissioner . #% As regards torture weapons , we have a situation where these weapons are being sent to certain parts of the world with an EU stamp on them . #% Madam President , I would urge you to consider the position that now exists in relation to the foot-and-mouth crisis in the United Kingdom . #% We have called for the Commission to take action in this regard . #% We demand to have our say on how this issue is addressed . #% As well as the physical and political reconstruction of Iraq , we also have to rebuild relationships within the EU itself and our credibility in the field of common foreign and security policy , we have to repair the damage that has been inflicted on the UN and , last but not least , we have to rebuild the transatlantic relationship . #% I look forward to working with the Austrian Presidency and finalising this very pragmatic law that will assist businesses and citizens in recovering debts , and to a full plenary debate with the Council and Commission and a vote in the New Year . #% The EU Constitution expounds the false position that the EU creates all rights , even fundamental rights . #% I urge the remaining countries that have not made their global commitment to combating climate change , to do so , via the Kyoto Protocol . #% Madam President , the twin bodies of the Petitions Committee and the European Ombudsman form a key plank in bringing the European Union closer to its people . #% The G20 ministers have to make a firm commitment to supporting decent work and prioritising job growth , alongside minimum income , social protection and training or re-training for those who do not have work . #% Future waste disposal in Ireland does not and can not rely on the continued search for landfill sites by local authorities up and down the country . #% Still students are encountering financial problems while studying abroad . #% I make no apology to anybody for the second principle which I think has to be present and that is the principle of social justice . #% Antimicrobial resistance can be transmitted from humans to animals and vice versa . #% The EU governments must look to the issue of reforming the EU budget , the common agricultural policy and the EU structural funds in a balanced , even-handed manner . #% They have agreed that the fight against terrorism must continue within a United Nations framework . #% The implications of this are very traumatic , because incomes will fall despite the compensation that is on offer . #% It is a great pity that we are moving away from the social policy aspects of these Funds , which provided some relief for companies and , in particular , the workers of companies who were being restructured . #% The greatest responsibility we have as a European Union - and this was mentioned by the leader of my party , Mr Bruton , when he addressed this Parliament as President-in-Office - is to extend our good fortune to less fortunate peoples throughout the world . #% I would like , in supporting Mrs Mouskouri 's report and congratulating her on it , to say : let us say it for the small books ; let us say it for the little , special minority language books ; let us say it for those who still enjoy the pure and absolute pleasures of a good book . #% It would be useful if the Commission , in its future annual reports , specified what funding has been provided by national , regional and local public bodies and by the private sector , in addition to European funding , with a view to setting up the trans-European transport networks . #% Some of the amendments put forward by the rapporteur , such as Amendment No 6 , are too prescriptive , while others such as Amendment No 14 , are too restrictive . #% The lessons of the past have been learned and tremendous care has been taken to ensure that every link in the food chain is checked for soundness . #% Legislative instruments are called for when negotiations are not concluded in relation to training , lifelong learning , organisation of work , adjustments , new forms of work , guidelines for negotiations by social partners and supplementary sickness insurance . #% I used my vote to endorse Amendments 354 and 352 as a means of opposing funding of research activities aimed at the cloning of human embryos . #% While I welcome the substance of what this proposal aims to do , for the reasons I have outlined in relation to the legal basis , I and my Irish colleagues will be voting against the report . #% We must seek to ensure that they achieve in life what they set out to achieve , and not be alienated from us . #% Mr President , the Commission 's proposals for the WTO negotiation modality , or rules on agriculture , were unanimously supported by Member States at the recent General Affairs Council , following earlier discussions with various trade policy groups and the agriculture fora . #% Finally , several tuna bodies are in the throes of establishing limits on the capacity of the fishing fleets that are allowed to be involved in the fishery . #% Because of reform of the EU financial systems and reductions in structural funding and cohesion funding to certain countries under the Agenda 2000 reform package , it is essential that we find new ways of financing these very essential projects . #% Up to now , the only permanent presidency in existence was that of the Commission . #% Harmonising Member States ' visa policies with regard to third countries is , in my view , essential as a major step towards improving the safety of travel documents . #% The rural economy has evolved over the years and there is now a heavy reliance on environmental projects . #% I obviously have a particular concern in that this crisis is threatening a EUR 15bn food industry in the Republic of Ireland because of the steps we have had to take to ensure that foot-and-mouth disease does not get a hold there . #% I hope it is defeated because then in the longer term you will come back with a proposal that represents the common sense view of everyone in this European Union , and not just those with purist ideals who do not have to face the consequences of imposing their ideals on others . #% in writing . - We need to gear the EU budget for the 21st century . #% Firstly , do you consider waste incineration a renewable energy , because we need clarification on that ? #% Without this reorientation the Ombudsman 's role , however worthy , can only be overwhelmed by our democratic deficit . #% More than 30 % of the traffic into Dublin is in transit and it is time to take a firm political decision to sort out the transport problems once and for all . #% Mr President , I think it is a terrible shame that a so-called civilized country like the United States has to be criticized in this Parliament . #% I want to speak on two or three points , firstly energy efficiency . #% I come from a country that , tragically , has a history of mass emigration over hundreds of years . #% However in relation to the 6 dates he mentioned on RTEs liveline programmes , he was inaccurate in at least half of them . #% As the Commissioner knows , farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities . #% However , while I agree with the general thrust of the compromise resolution , I would like to express my reservations regarding paragraphs 4 and 5 . #% Secondly , some Members have referred to this as the ` constitution ' of Europe . #% When I return from Brussels or wherever , be it a Thursday evening or Friday morning , the greatest welcome I get is from my collection of dogs - at least in terms of the noise they make and the length of time . #% In the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference Commissioner Mandelson made significant concessions on European agriculture in exchange for , I suppose , the hope of concessions in non-agricultural market access from the other big economic powers but , as we know , they did not concede much . #% We have an important role to play in the world and we should seek to play that role now of all times . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Piétrasanta , for his thorough work on the Galileo positioning system . #% My view concerning Romania and Bulgaria -- particularly Romania -- is that membership of the European Union would be good for those children who find themselves abandoned or in care . #% 
Whose interests come first ? #% In particular , I congratulate her and her Government on their tenacity and willingness to be involved in what were considered to be many difficult issues . #% What role for Parliament can the presidency and the Council envisage to guarantee effective parliamentary scrutiny of the reserve mechanism ? #% The recent outbreaks of violence in Nigeria are emblematic of a wider problem that faces the country . #% But , as I have just indicated to the House , the rules currently governing the structural funds will expire at the end of 1999 . #% Mr President , I ask you to give this your utmost priority , because , as Annetta Flanigan said , they only went there to help the people of Afghanistan . #% This is not the way to do business . #% I believe it is important to get away from the emotive aspects of the debate and focus on our role as European legislators , which is to guarantee consumers that we have put a legal framework in place that guarantees the best quality and the safest products . #% As we inevitably wind down some of the supports in the process of enlargement and , at the same time , maintain the pressures to protect the environment and the consumers , then there will be friction between the producers and the European administration . #% Thank you again to all concerned . #% A European Union-wide identification system for cattle is long overdue . #% Regarding the problems he raises such as the different standards of horse power , I have heard complaints by our own fishermen . #% I welcome the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection 's support for the polluter pays principle and the proposal for a tax on waste going into the landfill sites . #% The 10-month and 22-month premium for steers and the deseasonalisation premium must be kept in place . #% The Commissioner emphasised that all measures are weighed up against their effect on growth , competitiveness and the sustainability of public finances in the long run . #% Our concerns about trafficking in children as the world was beating a path to their door in search of children became obscured between the desperation of parents looking for children to adopt and the clear indications that many of those who were facilitating commercial trafficking in children became part of the politics of Romania , and indeed those countries whose nationals were pressurising for open adoption , notably the USA . #% This proposal is against not only laws and constitutions , but also the conscience of millions of citizens . #% in writing . - Men 's violence against women is a violation of women 's human rights which both reflects and reinforces inequalities between men and women . #% But most of the instruments which can affect the growth of employment are still in the hands of the Member States . #% The Belgian Presidency has probably been the best presidency I have witnessed in the 18 years I have been a Member of this House . #% Ireland has a long sporting tradition , and in particular an amateur and voluntary tradition . #% I voted against Amendment 81 to totally reject this report . #% I am quite amazed at the Commissioner 's answer . #% I should like to know what has happened to the thinking behind the rational planning in the gas and electricity distribution sectors draft directive . #% There have been impressive improvements under your Presidency in our work rate with regard to co-legislation and that is due to good management of our agenda . #% I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form . #% I would commend to you , Mr President , that you should -- as you remarked -- stand by the ruling . #% The claim is that the Commission wants there to be a balanced approach in dealing with ethanol-producing countries . #% The recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are major problems with this business , such as over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs . #% The other problem with the common fisheries policy is that on the one hand the Commission has the responsibility but can merely give advice . #% Organised crime gangs with vast resources at their disposal are operating with impunity . #% They face a squeeze from banks when it comes to existing credit and the future credit that is necessary to their existence . #% Our achievements in the EU are relevant elsewhere , and we should defend them - your task Commissioner . #% I think everything is contained within this overall report to ensure that we can give those guarantees to individuals . #% I read today that Germany has come up with a somewhat bizarre solution which appears to be to cover nuclear power stations with artificial fog ! #% I would like to thank the leader of our delegation , Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo , and all colleagues for making it that . #% I believe that we must protect people as much as possible from the dangers of drugs . #% I welcome what Mr Cox has said on the different matters he mentioned . #% This has been very short-sighted , as I am sure the Commissioner will agree . #% One of the main points to be considered is to ensure that pilot fatigue does not endanger flight safety . #% This would enable them to set up their own business and promote entrepreneurship . #% In Ireland , where there is already existing legislation , the Criminal Justice Act 1994 is presently being updated to take into account some of the proposals contained in this directive . #% We could learn from it and we could apply the best elements of it to Tempus III . #% Your party colleague , Mr Gerard Collins , was correct in saying that everything can continue under the existing rules . #% These must be guaranteed to all residents of the Union without discrimination . #% I note that with some conviction and with much right on his side , he has recited for us many of the accomplishments of the College which , as President , he has the privilege of leading . #% Recently there have been reports in British newspapers which point out that European leaders have ordered police and intelligence agencies to coordinate their efforts to identify and track anti-capitalist demonstrators . #% I do not believe that we should be producing European directives that can be interpreted in different ways . #% The intention of the proposal was to create minimum harmonisation of a statutory provision within individual Member States concerning the need for legal guarantees , all of which Mr Whitehead so eloquently referred to . #% There are consultation groups and citizens ' groups ; if you had put a group outside Pilate 's palace they still would have told you to free Barabas . #% That is why it is important , as the previous speaker has said , that the study of minority languages should be encouraged in the Socrates programme . #% What is obviously needed is a wholly independent Commissioner for standards in public life . #% Is that still your position , and what difference do you think that would make in terms of price differentials ? #% It is not a position that you will hear too often from an Irish Member in this House and , for that reason , I wanted to put it on the record . #% We need a financing instrument which is exclusively targeted at the objectives of poverty eradication as defined in the Lisbon Treaty and which only covers developing countries . #% The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission ' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments . #% The rapporteur mentions the ` plastic soup ' , the drifting mass of plastic and rubber in the Pacific Ocean , and notes what is described as an increasing problem in the Atlantic Ocean of lost fishing nets . #% Mr President , let me start by saying that I agree with absolutely every word the last speaker said ; I shall not repeat it all , but well done ! #% They do not hurt the elite of the state on which the sanctions are imposed . #% That has got us into difficulties on this issue . #% Its political and parliamentary leadership has shown that it is unable or unwilling to control them . #% On the positive side , Macau 's economy has progressed significantly since the handover , enjoying a 4 % growth in GDP during the year 2000 . #% The proposed action plan , the joint inspection structure and any new fisheries control agency must involve all the stakeholders in introducing a harmonised code of conduct for inspections . #% I fully agree that food must be traceable through all stages of the food chain , from farm to table . #% I support the extension of the existing directive on carcinogens to include dust from oak and beech wood , category 1 and category 2 mutagens and vinyl chloride monomer . #% In this context , I pay tribute to the Irish Government for a whole series of actions it has taken in this sector . #% 
No amendments were tabled requiring the board of a company to consult prior to a takeover bid . #% And instead of being the puppet of Israel , they should join with us in an even-handed policy approach to the tragedy in the Middle East . #% So our approach must be proportionate , particularly when we realise that every minute two children in Africa die of malaria . #% This must be tackled ; without ensuring that action is taken , it will not be effective . #% My question , therefore , is : to what extent can an agreed reform be protected in the context of the forthcoming WTO negotiations ? #% in writing . - I strongly support this report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals . #% I personally agree that taxation is the responsibility of the individual Member State . #% When European farmers demonstrate in the streets about the common agricultural policy , it is not because they are against the policy but because they fear that they may be deprived of it . #% In Ireland over the last eight months something in the region of 24 million euros ' worth of illegal substances was seized by police and customs officers , in Britain 82 million euros ' worth and across the rest of the European Union 297 million euros ' worth . #% In this case I hope it does . #% Turning to Morocco , the Greens will be voting against this proposal , not because we oppose compensation for fishermen put out of work , but because we oppose this particular package . #% Antibiotics should not be added to foods . #% I am also disappointed the Council did not give its explicit support for a legal framework for public services in the context of competition regulations , as the European Parliament urged . #% This House , as an institution , and the Irish people , need to guarantee that we can deliver on ratification of the Treaty of Nice in the short term . #% In some cases , this may mean allowing the adoptions to proceed . #% I welcome , in particular , the more long-term budgetary assurances to 2013 but feel that the 1 % inflation provision should at least be index-linked . #% It is not good enough . #% If we do not have the money , we can not undertake the actions and policies we want . #% Such a development would have serious consequences for the socioeconomic infrastructure of rural communities . #% The WHO radiation expert has gone on record about the opposition to this project encountered at all stages of its development . #% We can not ignore the widespread abuse of human rights in China , particularly with regard to a harmless but tiny minority -- namely practicing Christians . #% Nor must we lose sight of the fact that the core and single most important component for the development of rural regions is the maintenance of sustainable agriculture at the very heart of their economies . #% We have a situation in Ethiopia where we knew for the past three years that there was a famine coming . #% I trust that this matter , which the President-in-Office knows something about as it affects the country of which he is Prime Minister , will be attended to . #% I was honoured to take on this role at the request of the Committee on Petitions . #% The alarming rise of the incidence in animals of tuberculosis and brucellosis highlights the need for immediate action against these diseases . #% Choosing to ignore them is a short-sighted and counterproductive approach which not only goes against the principles guiding our external action but will also undermine the European social model . #% I support their concern as it is generally believed that international criminals are now more interested in cigarette smuggling than drug-trafficking as it is more profitable and less dangerous . #% If the Commission were allowed to go ahead - and I am quite sure it will not - it would do more damage to non-urban areas in the European Union than anybody here could imagine . #% I would like to pay tribute again to the rapporteur . #% Where the Pirker text puts the case for enforcement penalties for trafficking , pushing and consumption of synthetic drugs , the Greens seek to delete the reference to consumption . #% Madam President , we support the report of Mr Teverson and the conclusions he comes to . #% If the President of the Council of Ministers required to see a monument to the success to the Turin conference , then obviously he would have been greatly disillusioned and disappointed here this morning when he came to report on the conference to the European Parliament . #% This follows Ireland 's endorsement of the European Charter on alcohol of the World Health Organization 's Paris conference last December . #% Finally , the European Union is the natural home of the Irish , both geographically and politically . #% The European Union , through the experience of its Member States and experts and by virtue of this proposal , which has been greatly improved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , is rising to the challenge of assisting Member States in public health . #% In Ireland , for example , military goods can be exported to China , as long as they are not sold directly to the military . #% It does not matter whether you come from Galicia , it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland . #% They will give us the type of debate that will mean we can put away all the documents we read diligently and carefully on technical matters that we should not be debating at all . #% So we should remember that it was not entirely clear from the very start where we were going . #% Those who think that more Europe with Europe-wide political parties is the answer are , I believe , missing the point . #% It beggars belief that , in a so-called civilised society in the 21st century , there is still trophy hunting . #% We welcome initiatives by the Member States in the EU on safer Internet use for children but we need to step up our actions for a more coordinated campaign to fight against Internet paedophilia . #% In technical terms , the amendments ensure that certain draft decisions taken by the Commission are recognised as delegated acts as defined in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union . #% By not creating a first and second class category of membership we would also be sending a positive message to potential investors which is essential if these countries are to successfully meet the economic criteria for membership . #% Mr President , like other colleagues , I too welcome the opportunity for this debate even though I would vehemently disagree with some of those who propose support for this resolution . #% I will come to these shortly . #% I wish to apologize unreservedly to all Members for any personal insult they may have felt . #% Not too far from here children are still viewed as disposable objects for international adoption , for example . #% The improvement in Ireland 's position is welcome and is a tribute to the successful implementation of our stabilization policies over a number of governments and to the productive use which has been made of the EU structural funds , which have has enabled us to make our economy grow . #% If there are to be problems - and sometimes there are problems - it will be around this whole question of the proposal to finance the shortfall in Category 4 with money from the agricultural section of the budget . #% I must , however , clarify that the preferred terminology is sustainable development or sustainability requiring in environmental policy the promotion or focus on renewable energy sources . #% I believe that in response to the accident involving the there is a clear need to ensure that full and swift payments can be made to victims of future oil spills , notwithstanding our obligation to do everything possible to prevent such incidents from happening in the future . #% As already mentioned by some of my colleagues and , in particular , my Scottish colleague , peripheral areas of Europe would be more adversely affected than others by these restrictions . #% I welcome any agreement that guarantees protection of the rainforests of our planet , if such agreements also advance the protection of the indigenous people of the forest and give a better life to the majority of the people in the countries concerned . #% On the matter of a referendum I accept his explanation . #% I hope these rumours of so-called financial sanctions to be taken against Ireland are untrue . #% Mr President , in relation to BSE , dioxins and concern about the safety of GM foods , this House has been vigilant and responsive to consumer concerns . #% There are instances where junior doctors in training are working 120 hours a week . #% In fact , if I had my way , he would not even have been allowed in Parliament . #% The Member States who are doing this have to acknowledge that they are not meeting their obligations . #% Mr President , I welcome this report and the Commission 's response to Parliament 's amendments . #% President Mugabe has presided over the destruction of a once vibrant country . #% We need to find innovative and workable solutions to ensuring the health and safety of domestic workers and , in the overall context , to ensure that their rights are fully respected . #% I would , however , like to focus on the proposal to include the chemicals used in tobacco products under REACH . #% One year after the Bonn Conference , it is an opportune time to reflect on the EU 's contribution in restoring peace , stability and credible political structures . #% 
Existing arrangements for access to the Irish box must be retained permanently in the reform process . #% Would you agree that the Commission has been remiss in the way it did not conduct adequate studies into the effect of the abolition of duty-free ? #% The illegal drugs trade is now a sophisticated international business . #% Commissioner , I think you have answered my question . #% ` Softly , softly ' conciliation is merely banked by the terrorists , who then demand more and more . #% It is gratifying that we in the European Union are prepared to take the lead to tackle that worldwide problem and deal with such a wasteful side-effect of the fishing industry . #% That is why I particularly welcome the decision to have two capitals of culture operating in the east and west , as it were , of the continent . #% We are prepared to engage in the debate on closer cooperation and welcome the way it has been put to us by a number of important political personalities outside this House . #% It looks as if there are six countries currently at risk for delays or rejections of proposals for the use of Structural Funds , including my own , the UK , certain German Länder , France , Sweden and Belgium . #% I want to make a few things clear here at the outset . #% Mr President , at this moment of the emergence of a draft Treaty on the IGC , are we to find once again that , contrary to assurances we have heard this morning on citizenship and democracy , a review of the Euratom Treaty has been neglected ? #% The many thousands of workers who marched in the streets of Brussels recently - airport workers , industrial workers , generally from the duty-free industry - should not have to beg for their jobs . #% There is little doubt that fisheries agreements are coming under much closer scrutiny to determine what they achieve and what they deliver , not only for people in the European Union , but also for the countries with which they were concluded in the first place . #% Mr President , Mr Rothley 's own-initiative report is indeed most welcome at this stage in the evolution of the single market . #% This is an important commercial consideration that must be borne in mind . #% Whilst superficially proposing to increase nuclear safety , they hide their true purpose which is to revitalise a totally defunct nuclear industry . #% Our government has applied over and over again for ever-increasing amounts of structural and cohesion funds without feeling that the EU has any right to scrutinize how the money is spent . #% I can understand why you would have to take a head count . #% We have no indigenous car manufacturing plants , not even assembly plants . #% It needs to make its services better known to libraries , to consumer watchdogs and , of course , to my fellow MEPs , as well as to local authorities , which are often in breach of EU law . #% I also support the targeted road safety aspect to this report , with a theory test for mopeds becoming compulsory from 2013 . #% I accept that the presidency views this as a serious problem . #% The Simpson report strikes the balance between improving the present service levels and ensuring that a universal service can be offered to all the citizens of the European Union , irrespective of where they live . #% It is doing the fishing industry no favours in the long term if this is the kind of simplistic , nationalistic short-term approach that has been taken . #% I also strongly support the need to maintain export refunds as a crucial stabilising tool within the budget . #% I suppose the technicalities of this debate will go right over the heads of many farmers . #% You need reliability and no discrimination ; you need help , particularly at domestic level , for energy efficiency measures ; and you need strong emphasis on public service obligations . #% I know that this Parliament is serious about fisheries conservation . #% Mr President , Tunisia is a country that has an important relationship with the European Union . #% For that we need an effective system of traceability and control that will restore confidence . #% I agree with the proposal to introduce severe penalties where it is found that animals have been mistreated during production and during transport . #% I should also like to compliment Mr Mulder on his work . #% What official business could be more important than this debate this morning ? #% The big problem is that these countries selling flags of convenience have no intention of enforcing these rules , and that is the main reason why they appeal to these unscrupulous shipowners who can do what they like . #% As a result of what I saw then I deliberately set out to give longer time to develop an alternative method of trapping in order to cause the minimum amount of difficulty to the indigenous people in Canada . #% It is spread all over the place ! #% The human rights situation inside Burma within ethnic provinces is hugely concerning . #% The problem of trafficking has been identified by the Commission , and all Member States -- including my own country , Ireland -- need to play their part to stop this cruel and horrific trade in vulnerable human beings . #% As you know , in the original directive of 1985 on the recognition of architects ' qualifications , certain Member States did not get derogations for what is known as an established right to practice . #% The first priority - the plight of the unemployed - is also our first priority . #% If the political will exists , a ninth can be found and persuaded . #% The publication of the Green Paper on sustainable energy in Ireland should be viewed as a positive contribution to the debate on how we deal with the climate change threat within the energy sector . #% I believe it was Voltaire who said , ' I do not agree with what you say , but I will defend to the death your right to say it . ' #% This keeps the prices of passenger cars and all road vehicles amongst the most expensive in the EU , including imports of used cars . #% Since the 1980s Ireland has advocated a policy of de-institutionalisation , aiming to develop a modern mental health service via a community-based system , promoting mental health , giving the mentally ill as independent a life as possible and providing comprehensive healthcare , moving away from psychiatric hospitals . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Ebner for a very comprehensive and stimulating report . #% I am very glad to hear the Commission 's reply because the funding that Coillte has was set up by the state , it was the state that set Coillte up . #% Why are we not , for instance , opening up discussions and debate with Iran at the present time ? #% Above all , we require of you strength and integrity . #% I would like to ask President Santer : how can the committee act as an ethical scrutiny body on biotechnological inventions as Parliament wants , when its remit is only to look at basic ethical principles and not at individual issues raised by patent applications ? #% I urge support for the common position , which sets an accepted deadline of 2012 . #% Finally , while we are debating human rights in the EU for 2005 , I can not let the occasion pass without registering my concern regarding the need for clarity on the so-called CIA rendition flights issue . #% With the greatest of respect , it would be arrogant on our part not to do so . #% So , the Charter should have dealt with the issue of privatization of energy resources in greater detail , outlining the protection available to the consumer who ultimately would be affected by any changes in this regard . #% The European Commission intervened at that point and proposed a settlement . #% One of the main problems with providing education in many countries is the catastrophic effect AIDS is having on the lives not just of children , many of whom are orphans because they have lost one or both parents . #% We are seen as passive bystanders . #% In my own country of Ireland , we are still coming to terms with the legacy of British rule and the continuing partition of our country , along with decades of discrimination in the electoral process , in housing , employment and policing . #% Mr President , first of all the Commissioner is being very facetious with his answers . #% Tobacco advertising tends to glamorize smoking , but there is nothing glamorous about smoking , about cancer , chronic bronchitis and all the other tobacco-related illnesses that kill many millions each year . #% We did not support Amendment 8 as we must consider all options rather than commit specifically to a ` Tobin-style ' tax . #% Finally , I compliment and reassure Mr Ahern on his continuing mastery of the English language so that he might have the confidence to abandon the foolish notion of wasting millions of euros of taxpayers ' money on making Irish an official language of these institutions . #% However , in one sense the debate has moved on , because it is now up to the Member States and the debate on the Treaty-ratification process that takes place in the Member States . #% There is one paper recycler , little plastics recycling , no metal recyclers and the only glass recycler in the country has recently closed down . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , in fact Mr Stevenson is right : eight years ago Labour MEPs were calling for an end to the cruel trade in cat and dog fur . #% I was personally aware of the explanation , which you have now given publicly . #% 
The daily discharges from the nuclear plant at Sellafield are now estimated at nine million tonnes of nuclear waste . #% I agree that bee diseases should be highlighted in EU veterinary policy , both to highlight the importance of bees and also to have a policy and to monitor the population across Europe . #% I would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the two rapporteurs despite the fact that I do not agree with everything that they have set down and suggested . #% For instance , in 2002 average farm family income on the 40 % of farms classified as full-time was EUR 27 760 . #% We hear much about the privileged treatment given to asylum seekers and I hope we will hear no more of this . #% This is detailed in the monitoring report of the Enlargement Commission . #% We should remember that we have evidence to suggest that if conservation measures are properly carried out and control is exercised we can increase the take for European fishermen by something like EUR 5,000 million worth of product a year . #% In relation to truck drivers , it seems to me that the only way to regulate this is to put it into law . #% Third , and most important , there is still no known case of transmission from human being to human being . #% One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned . #% While the summit did not result in any significant decisions , it certainly provided a valuable opportunity for the heads of state or government to discuss the state of progress of the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference . #% I very much welcome the initiative that Minister Quinn took , although not with successful results . #% It would be wrong to give in to attempts to demonise GM foods and feedstuffs . #% The huge human , social and economic fall-out from this is incalculable . #% The Iranian Government and Iranian Parliament have expressed their gratitude to the EU and to the broader international community for the assistance they have been given to help in the reconstruction of Bam and to help the thousands of displaced persons in this region . #% Ireland has one of the highest rates of VRT in Europe , with almost 10 % of the total tax take coming from motorists . #% Language often fails us on these occasions . #% They should test ETA 's commitment and bona fides and realise that you should not and can not give rewards for doing that which was necessary and right . #% In conclusion , I have had much representation in Ireland on the need to take cognisance of the special vintage car industry in Europe . #% In particular , it is quite incredible that Parliament should not criticise - since it has often criticised - its role as regards the Commission and that we should not be able to dismiss individual Commissioners rather than the Commission as a collegiate body , because Parliament will never use that power . #% I should like to commend their courage and tenacity . #% We have overruled and mixed up what we have voted for in the draft Statute by the previous vote . #% The initial expenditure required to tackle this fraud would be more than compensated for by the gains in revenue by the Member States . #% We currently do some of those things , which makes the current programme even more topical and even more useful . #% In this regard , I would urge colleagues to support the plenary amendments tabled by my own group and other groups , which are very clear and simple , and to delete these elements . #% We are in favour of voluntary action but if it is true that the airlines have known for 30 years about the risks of DVT then maybe we need legislation . #% I fully realise the absolute requirement to make way for enlargement of the Union to the east and to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the forthcoming WTO round . #% This directive is part of an overall package which is being implemented by the European Union at this time to comply with the obligations under the Kyoto Accord . #% He did say they might get a second chance it might not be the first time they voted against it . #% It is important that business is clear about its obligations to provide information on promotions . #% This , we believe , is the new direction for Europe . #% ` On 31 January both the European Parliament and the Council demonstrated a clear will to find a political solution to the problem of national measures , already adopted by some Member States , to reduce F-gas emissions . #% Proper regulation of working time is a cornerstone for social Europe . #% I have concentrated in my committee mainly on the issues of the internal market , intellectual property aspects and the general policy framework . #% I have to ask why there was this last-minute inclusion on the agenda last Friday , without the proper teeing-up among the various political groups . #% In Northern Ireland we have a small but determined organic sector . #% We must put in place appropriate re-training measures to ensure that the people who lost their jobs at Dell can secure employment in the near future . #% This is no easy task . #% Ireland is seldom the first port of call for prospective asylum seekers . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution on the United Nations Platform for Action for Gender Equality , which identifies key steps required for the European Union to meet strategic objectives on equality between women and men . #% The paramilitary groups have to be dismantled , the crimes have to be investigated , and those responsible have to be held accountable . #% Human rights lobbyists I have spoken to contend that much of the reforms in Romania are of the ` smoke and mirrors ' variety and that the theory does not always translate into real progress on the ground . #% The emphasis is on helping people to assert their rights and to understand to participate fully in the democratic process . #% Governments throughout the EU should be honest with their electorate , especially in neutral countries like my own , and say : ` This is really what is going on here . #% On the issue of the amendment to Article 33 ( 1 ) , I am anxious to ensure that a Member State should not be able to levy more contributions on a pensioner who receives pensions from several Member States than if that pensioner were receiving all his pensions from just that Member State . #% I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity at least to stretch my thoughts a little bit further than I have ever been allowed to do in this House before . #% They can not be allowed to get away with treating passengers like this any longer . #% By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government . #% Finally , I am glad , President-in-Office , that you corrected yourself about Irish being a lesser-used language . #% Whilst the Republic of Madagascar should be entitled to use the proceeds of this agreement as it sees fit , I am pleased to see that the major part - 60 % - of the total remunerative package of ECU 2.28 million is to be used for scientific research , conservation and training and therefore will be of direct benefit to the coastal regions and the people who live there . #% Take , for example , the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy : despite all the fine words and the good proposals put forward by the Commission , it is clear , when you actually look at what has come out , that this is really a shadow of what was proposed . #% Madam President , let me begin by congratulating all the rapporteurs on their very hard work over a very long period of time . #% On behalf of my Group , I then supported proposals for EUR 30 - a figure which I believe is the very minimum necessary to close the gap and help restore profitability to the sector . #% Many of these prisoners are the very people who are responsible for organized crime , murdering and terrorizing elderly people in their own homes . #% This is one of the most serious abuses of human rights in the world today . #% The most logical response to higher oil prices is to switch to using alternative energy sources and focus on the use of renewable energies to promote energy efficiency . #% Anybody who has been to Dublin recently will know of the seriousness of our traffic congestion problems . #% I support the part of the report that states , in Amendment 17 , that we must insist on the same standards in third countries as in the European Union . #% We must break down legal barriers to harmonize those concepts of criminal legislation in the Member States which reduce our capacity to protect our children . #% We insist on a report back on how the ban is being implemented and action if it is not working . #% Responsible political leaders in London must now take the initiative and reassure the British people that they have nothing to fear from their neighbours in the European Union . #% The summit should concentrate on elaborating broad political guidelines concerning this package of proposals which will have a major impact , not just on the functioning of the European institutions but also on the daily life of the citizens over the coming years . #% The principle was clearly established in 1993 that directives are to avoid imposing administrative , financial and legal restrictions which would affect these kind of undertakings . #% You only have to look at the UN reports on Bogota , whenever they are published , to find accounts of gross human rights violations . #% I find it astonishing , given that Ireland depends so much on technology for its economic development and growth , that this area is so badly funded and so badly addressed in current educational policy in Ireland . #% Mr President , this morning in the Irish press there was a very interesting report by the European Research Institute in Ispra . #% 
Likewise , environmental orthodoxies must be constantly scrutinised and re-evaluated to ensure that the protection required is proportionate and effective . #% The longer an incident is allowed to go unchecked the wider the impact , as we have seen . #% This is indeed a breakthrough for our citizens and a concrete example to them of the way that the European Union can be of direct benefit . #% We have a duty to ensure that we cooperate and coordinate with other representatives of the peoples of Europe . #% That is right and proper , in view of the fact that the European Parliament has to approve the right of any Member State to accede to the Union as a new and full Member . #% These genetically modified varieties will make decisive contributions to feeding the world 's rapidly growing population . #% So , the Commission , in bringing forward their new proposals , must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services . #% I urge Members to support every amendment that retains freedom from patentability . #% In the area of agriculture Mr Tillich does not say much . #% It is crucial for the long term viability of the livestock sector overall that the Commission ensure that their actions on trade and agriculture do not compromise European farmers , but support the sustainability and viability of the European livestock sector into the future . #% We must realise that these stocks are endangered and we must protect the fishing industry . #% Good luck , Commissioner , when you go to Luxembourg . #% We welcome the fact that you have now brought forward the new Toy Safety Directive . #% That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria . #% Moreover , the road haulage sector employs over 30 000 people in Ireland . #% It would be interesting to know what the expenditure of financial services institutions will be on analytics in the EU after the introduction of Basel II . #% I welcome the fact that the European Union is now putting in place a charter for Erasmus students which will be available to all students in 2003 . #% Fewer people want to become seafarers . #% The amendments we tabled and which have been taken on board by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights will hopefully help to bring about the free movement of workers , as Ms Oddy mentioned , and these people will be able to practice anywhere in the Community . #% They have taken a lot of stick and have been hurt unnecessarily in many ways . #% Any deal on agriculture can not come at any price : it must be balanced and fair . #% Paragraph A continues to confuse the principle of additionality with the separate but equally important principle of co-financing . #% Needless to say , I fully support the policies being pursued by our Minister for Finance . #% What I am seeking is a commitment from you Mr President , as President-in-Office , to bring this before the Council at some stage in the future . #% And yet what Europe is trying to find at the moment -- in order to ensure that the rich tapestry of today 's re-united Europe is properly represented within all the institutions -- is people who have opinions , people who have visions , people who can best represent the countries that nominate them . #% Mining and quarrying waste accounts for nearly 30 % of the annual EU waste , which equals hundreds of millions of tons of waste . #% I do not agree with the British Prime Minister 's view that this problem should be tackled at national level . #% I would stress to certain colleagues that there is no basis in the Treaty to support such a link . #% The regulation of 13 March 1998 is due to come into effect on 1 January next year . #% However , I have some concerns regarding the amount of legislation sought by this report and the move towards creating more bureaucracy and red tape , which could work to the detriment of the ideals underlying the social policy agenda . #% She is the first President-in-Office I have heard say there will inevitably be job losses because of this decision . #% Today 's narrow vote by Parliament not to reject the claim is very disappointing . #% I congratulate the rapporteur and look forward to the response of Parliament and the Council to the way they have badly treated this in relation to the decision they took yesterday . #% The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed . #% Studies have also shown that social measures such as maternity leave help increase the female employment rate by 3-4 % . #% I will ensure that the honourable Member 's views are taken into account . #% I am disappointed that we have not been able to make further progress . #% It has done an outstanding job and I welcome the positive response in the report to it . #% This takes time . #% They are difficult to read in small species such as the cat , they are difficult to read in breeds where the ears are cropped , they are difficult for regulatory officers to read in aggressive or apprehensive individuals and they are relatively easy to erase and to change fraudulently . #% in writing . - While academics will argue over the best possible way to measure progress , we as European legislatures must be confident in the method we pick and ensure that it stands up to argument both today and in the future . #% I am pleased to note that this week Minister Cowen , as President-in-Office , is making an official visit to the Middle East , where I am confident he will make every effort to move forward the peace process in that region . #% Investment in a clean environment in my country will in the medium to long term justify any additional expenditure incurred and the European Union will support any innovative measures in this regard . #% In the USA , and increasingly in Japan , patents have unfortunately been granted for what is essentially pure software . #% Yes , the United Nations has done sterling work but with no success for weapons inspection to date . #% I was torn between whether to vote for or against . #% The victims are the real prisoners of terrorism ; the perpetrators all too often walk free . #% Some progress is being made but more could be done if we put greater pressure on the Romanian authorities . #% Therefore it is imperative that we protect our postal system . #% I note with satisfaction that we did not have any embarrassing incidents during the Presidency , as we have had in other recent presidencies . #% While we were eventually able to implement a mixture of market management and income support measures , such as intervention in the milk fund and export refunds , which eased the pain to a degree , many dairy farmers ended up going out of business and many are suffering serious financial loss . #% It is a drug and should be accepted and recognised as such . #% The United States report suggests that legalisation there would lead to around a 100 % increase in heroin consumption and around a 50 % increase in that of cocaine . #% Mr President , to illustrate the situation in graphic detail , I can tell you about 600 workers in Ballyfermot in Dublin who were employed in the Semperit Plant , a subsidiary of Continental AG , one of the largest employers in this deprived area of Dublin . #% Nevertheless , it must be acknowledged that a thriving and efficient private sector can play a major role in developing the economy of third countries and in combating poverty . #% Stop this nonsense out in the corridors of this esteemed Parliament immediately . #% We always respond several months too late , we spend hours debating crises in this House and in other institutions , but we are not there , when it counts , as quickly as we should be . #% They used to be one of the world 's greatest fishing grounds , which is probably why fishermen went so far under difficult conditions to fish there . #% I have been very clear on what I have said . #% I hope you will pursue rigorously a policy of encouraging renewable energy sources and rational use of energy . #% This is a process that I am sure will be continued and deepened by our friends in the Belgian Presidency . #% Dr Hans Blix and Kofi Annan have made it clear that if they are given sufficient time and if they get full and active co-operation from the Iraqi authorities , then war can be avoided . #% Why has that been cut ? #% One could argue that it could not get any worse and it should go into private hands . #% Yesterday evening I went to see the exhibition hosted by the Joint Research Centre . #% However , what is most important is that the needs of the children are placed above all else . #% 
This Treaty brings the EU closer to its citizens . #% They are a signal of the new era of which you speak and I wish to welcome that on behalf of my group . #% Even though you talk about the justification for this , you do not mention what the consequences are or the cost effect for the Internet providers to provide such a facility . #% These things are necessary , but they should not be the picture that is presented to the people of Europe . #% There is a huge unemployment crisis in Europe today , but we should not kid ourselves about how to respond to it . #% Judicial cooperation is important because it complements the workings of the internal market and the single currency , as already stated . #% I regret to say that this situation pertains principally to my own country , Ireland . #% Many Members , especially citizens in neutral countries , have no say on whether this is what they want . #% In the overall context , securing peace in the Middle East is going to take time . #% I should also like to be a little bit nationalistic and say that I am extremely happy that it was during the Irish presidency that the importance of the issue that we are discussing today finally impacted on the political agenda under President Norah Owen , who was the President-in-Office at the time . #% It is not enough for us to simply seek to improve our capacity to arrest , detain , charge and imprison , important as that is ; we must guard against those actions that undermine the very rights that we seek to defend . #% Eventually , when we were listened to , we found that instrument . #% Madam President , after that intervention inspired by naked self-interest , may I come back to more important matters of the day . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response and understanding that actions have been taken , words have been said . #% . I believe that the European parties ' statute , which provides for the financing of European political parties , is in breach of the subsidiarity principle . #% That is an important message and the central message that has emerged from your successful presidency and on that you deserve rich and proper congratulation . #% I use the words ` marking ' very carefully because I do not think we can celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first Earth Summit . #% I agree , which precisely raises the question : `` Why bother ? '' #% However , my firm conviction is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power and that the stress tests taking place this year are a distraction from the real issue - the transition to a Europe powered by renewable energy . #% Finally , the Spanish Presidency of the European Union has been a very successful one . #% I agree with Mr Evans about CITES-listed species . #% Over the years most of us will have made representations on behalf of nationals of our own Member States who find that when they take advantage of the freedom of movement available to them within the EU and actually move to another country they are discriminated against because their qualifications are not properly recognised in their new country of residence . #% To quote directly , Commissioner Dimas welcomed the agreement as ` a clear and positive political signal ' but alluded to the fact that the Commission would later decide whether to issue a declaration on the record when the legislation was finally adopted , as it is scheduled to be tomorrow . #% If you can achieve that then you will go a long way to allaying the consumers ' fears . #% I would urge the Commission , too , to take this on board . #% But before his statement could be taken for what it was worth , it was totally undermined by the Council . #% The European Socialists are fully behind the leap forward which is possible given the cogent analysis that took place at the Lisbon Summit . #% We do not want to be prescriptive . #% This is forcing quarry owners to move from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland in order to compete , because otherwise they can not . #% It is wrong and harmful to suggest that the government and farmers are indifferent to environmental protection . #% Madam President , I should like to thank Mr Mombaur for his excellent report . #% Given the uncertainty that surrounded the issue prior to the Dublin II Summit , perhaps the single most significant political achievement was the agreement of the Stability Pact as part of the necessary preparations for economic and monetary union . #% But in Britain , BNFL has recently admitted the falsifications of safety checks on MOX fuel while in Japan the authorities have found that the plant at Tokaimura was operating illegally for four years . #% The issue at stake is one of principle and is crucial to the future nature of interinstitutional relations in the area of external action . #% To focus on trafficking only as crime means sidelining the support and services needed by the victims of trafficking . #% I also propose an additional amendment at this stage that sectors where this is systematic should potentially be subject to a Commission-approved block exemption or refund . #% I am satisfied that the 1957 European Convention as supplemented by the new EU convention relating to extradition provides a very good framework for extradition arrangements between Member States in relation to serious offences . #% Yesterday , as on many previous occasions , there was no interpretation into or out of Finnish or Swedish in the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , despite the fact that a member of the committee from Finland was presenting a report and had to deal with very detailed amendments . #% Ireland has consistently supported the European Union and this has been borne out in all of the referenda in my country , where the citizens - and it does not happen in every country - have been given the right to express their views in relation to Europe . #% The Tobin tax is one model of a financial transaction tax which has been proposed . #% Those problems always go back to the same two causes : PVC contains chlorine , and requires the addition of a wide variety of hazardous additives in large quantities if it is to be functional . #% The CAP has seen vast changes , and we must ensure that it is fit for purpose in the 21st century . #% We also want to protect the open-source community which makes a vital contribution to competitiveness in the area of software development . #% Another important paragraph is paragraph 20 , which calls for an end to the payment of export refunds on the export of live animals to third countries for slaughter . #% I support Parliament 's view in insisting on maintaining its existing powers over the budget . #% The estimated 2 500 lives a year that eCall could save throughout Europe is significant and therefore it needs to be taken seriously as a means of curbing high levels of road fatalities . #% One of the key issues is the ban on the direct advertising of breast implants to the public . #% Mr President , I welcome this directive and thank the rapporteur for his hard work . #% Take away Sunday as the day of rest and we will lose much of the richness of community life as it has been experienced by Europeans throughout the centuries . #% There is an urgent need to integrate planning and management and promote collaborative working of marine and terrestrial assistance at local , regional and national levels . #% A skilled and mobile young population is our greatest asset in a world that is becoming increasingly competitive . #% We will be better informed . #% However , being familiar with parliamentary democracy yourself , you know that eaten bread is soon forgotten and it is good to hold back some of the spicy and sugary stuff until the very end of the Presidency ! #% Fishing rights for EU vessels must be re-evaluated according to the most recent scientific analyses conducted by the regional fisheries organisation of west Africa . #% We have a model in Australia and New Zealand which could usefully be copied in the European Union Member States . #% They will of course have won control of the Iraqi oil wells , but Afghanistan is ignored . #% Consequently , this has had broader repercussions in sending a focused message to the citizens of Europe about the positive work of the European Union itself . #% Again , the subsidies can be creamed off by people in the middle as well as creating immense opportunities for irregular practices . #% The IRA stands exposed by the Dublin Justice Minister as deeply implicated in organised crime centred on Dublin port . #% Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , on behalf of my group I welcome the tone of the Council 's contribution and the content of the Commission 's contribution . #% It is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both the market and industry while conserving resources . #% If you are , when exactly are you going to do it ? #% I believe that the Member States are now moving towards self-imposed nonutilization of funding and slowing-down our processes , which will lead to problems in the longer term . #% Respecting the right of individual Member States , would the Council not coordinate a policy which grants visa-free access , which , in my view , is the total implementation of the concept of one country , two systems ? #% In February , the European Court of Justice ruled that waste incineration in municipal waste incinerators could not be counted as a form of recovery , even if energy was generated as a result . #% The companies who operate universal public services and the Member States have a responsibility to ensure that they are delivered and that the workers in these companies have legal certainty . #% 
So , it is not just a question of the technical matters relating to repatriation . #% Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris . #% I urge you , Mr President , to ask the Commission to monitor this situation very closely under the powers vested in it by means of the Euratom Treaty . #% Its crimes have been outlined by previous speakers so I will not go over them . #% However , I agree with the rapporteur that their management and application must be simplified . #% Any proposals will need the approval of Member States . #% I applaud the view expressed by the Commissioner that we all share the task of selling this historic challenge but I deplore the fact that someone as pre-eminent as Commissioner Verheugen , at least according to a number of newspapers today , should say the Member States should not leave the Commission to do the dirty job alone . #% The Irish authorities decided to play with fire when they set out to encourage industrial development by multinational chemicals companies in Ireland without looking at the long-term consequences . #% As well as this , there is a clear link between a poor and disadvantaged background and low educational achievement . #% Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country . #% Football is the only sport where agents are active in all EU Member States . #% I believe that Dublin should provide us with a separate and comprehensive statement of the European Council strategy to strengthen the fight for growth and employment . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement . #% Could you confirm whether it is true that Eurostat will be producing new figures in the next couple of days providing the economic indicators for 1996-1997 ? #% What is the dissemination for the new ideas , the new products , the new comparisons of socio-economic systems ? #% I have a right to defend myself under Rule 108 and you are wasting my time by interrupting me . #% It was necessary to threaten the Commission with the sack in order to ensure that Parliament 's demands for more scrutiny of budgetary procedures and financial management were met , and to force the Commission to undertake a root-and-branch review of the Commission 's management of taxpayers ' money . #% There are very serious questions here , Commissioner , and I do not consider it sufficient for you to say simply that you have asked the UK authorities . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the Berès report because of my support for the vast majority of its contents . #% Contrast this with the developing world , where 26 % of avoidable deaths are caused by tuberculosis . #% Could we take the vote on my group 's amendments first ? #% In reality , we know that consumers are not encouraged to shop on the Internet outside their own Member State and that national consumer organisations - including in my own Member State - are not advising consumers to go down this route because it is fraught with difficulties . #% It was adopted unanimously by our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and it provides us with a very useful argument in favour of economic and social development . #% Therefore , we should look for some flexibility on export quotas . #% Mr President , due to the time constraints imposed by you , which give my colleagues a chance of having their questions answered , can I very quickly thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% Mr President , I take the opportunity offered by the Stihler report to remind the House that the common fisheries policy has evolved greatly over the last 20 years and is now a fully-fledged Community policy with specific objectives . #% It is important that all Member States take this on board . #% You will recall that the first mediator on abducted children was appointed in response to the Algerian mothers ' campaigns in Belgium and France . #% In particular , it highlights the necessity for increased use of regulation to ensure that all Member States take action at the same time . #% It poses significant environment and health problems over its entire life cycle . #% We look forward to wide publicity for the benchmarking exercises , particularly in the areas of enterprise and innovation . #% Some countries bailed out their own banks at huge cost to the taxpayers , without any handouts from the EU . #% Not only does this cause problems for commuters and tourists in reaching the west and north-west , it also makes it very difficult to access those regions . #% Our government regulations were introduced in 1999 to counter this trend , which has been cited repeatedly since the 1980s as the main problem in Irish freshwaters . #% Fortunately in Ireland we have succeeded in this respect : we are now above that average . #% In the course of preparing my report I did a great deal of research ; I took it extremely seriously . #% In fact , as I am talking to you , I have just heard of gossip - and let ' s hope that is all it is - of sheep in Wexford , my own constituency , having been identified and being incinerated as we talk . #% The European Council ' s common position of June of this year seeks to establish a European framework for electronic signatures . #% I am also asking the Commission to take up the idea in my amendment on improved health briefings and health warnings on tickets in advance of flying . #% It is only right and proper that he answers to the Serbian people for crimes he has committed against them and in their name . #% As I said , I would have liked to have seen stronger teeth here , but we need legally binding measures - which I believe we have - which will begin a process of really ensuring that we deal strongly with energy saving in the European Union . #% Madam President , firstly , on Northern Ireland , it is clear that force and the threat of force have overcome the rule of law in Northern Ireland . #% Human rights continue to be abused , political activity is suppressed and , according to Amnesty International , there were more State executions in China last year than in all other countries combined . #% Markets are becoming increasingly liberalized as has been said by other Members in the debate , and this inevitably means that overseas competition will intensify . #% We have been in correspondence but I am raising the matter because I do not feel that I or this Parliament have received a proper answer . #% The Irish Constitution is in fact silent on the matter , as indeed is Irish law . #% I appreciate the progress that has been made , but it is totally unacceptable in the 21st century that legislation continues to be made in this way . #% We have to ask ourselves : if Russia and China can support the government , why can not we support the suffering Sudanese people ? #% The opening of a new air traffic control centre in England is four years behind . #% On the 60 % of farms classified as part-time , the income was only EUR 6 590 . #% To not allow public funding for research which is legal in a Member State is a curious sanction : nobody is forcing any Member State to make any type of research legal . #% A lot of people derided him or laughed at him because of what he had said . #% For us and for Europe the centre must hold , because the very future of the European Union depends on our efforts to involve our citizens and to communicate our positive vision for Europe . #% It has sat and twiddled its thumbs , waiting for an invitation from Indonesia , the country that has been illegally occupying East Timor for the last 25 years , whose Foreign Minister has stuck his fingers up at the UN General Assembly when the issue was raised . #% I do not share that approach , as I believe that the internal market laws should be the responsibility of Commission officials as part of the discipline of effective policy-making . #% In all , more than 30 billion television viewers are expected to watch the World Cup that has just started . #% We need to consider whether it is acceptable that the alcohol industry can advertise in such a carte blanche fashion . #% Finally , the European Union 's and the Member States ' policies must give greater attention to maintaining a healthy democratic division between urban and rural areas . #% We need to agree on how to plan for the future and making sure the results of such an exercise are accessible . #% Mr President , nobody can dispute the need to create a fair global trading system , but we should not delude ourselves in thinking that fully-liberalised trade will in itself bring about fairness . #% I do not think they would . #% It is unacceptable that we should be investing in tourism in a situation where gross human rights violations are taking place , where people ' s lives and liberty have basically been denied . #% In Austria , foreign ski instructors can not provide services for more than 14 days . #% In the limited time that is available it is important that , as a number of speakers have already touched upon a number of disadvantaged groups or groups who are not doing so well in employment areas , we consider a number of aspects , the three most important ones being : equality of opportunity , equality of access and equality of training . #% As consumption falls sharply and other countries rely on their own production without importing , the collapse of the Russian economy has further weakened a fragile market . #% An FTT could help reduce volatile and risky financial trading while raising billions to help tackle the effects of climate change and help developing countries who have been hit hardest by the financial crisis . #% 
I have come to the conclusion , having had a lot of experience in Parliament and with European affairs , that things have been steadily improving and that 1998 was one of the best performances we had . #% The issues are not linked , but we need to put our priorities right . #% I am sure that Mr Seal and his colleagues have noted this position . #% What is more , it says nothing about disabled people in China . #% We have had enough of this . #% I agree that we do not need , as other colleagues have said , first - and second-class fishermen . #% The idea was that at the end of each year the amount of carbon dioxide actually emitted had to match the amount of emission permits a company surrendered to its government . #% However , as I pointed out , it is hoped that the Council will soon be in a position to reach such a common position . #% We did ourselves debate the whole question of the harmonisation of the pharmaceutical industry . #% Madam President , coming from Donegal , a border county in the historic province of Ulster , I , like my Irish colleague Mrs Doyle , have a very special appreciation for the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland in the recent past , and in particular the developments of the last few days . #% I voted in favour of the Karamanou report . #% Do the people know that they have lost their power ? #% But , of course , if the Commission , representing all of us in ensuring that this agreement is put into good effect , does not have any resources to do it with , then we are back to the original situation as far as the Member States are concerned . #% We should be able to sit down and make progress in these areas . #% Many citizens are critical of nuclear power and the non-nuclear states have a right not to be polluted by emissions from nuclear states , such as those in the Irish Sea from Sellafield , now much increased by THORP . #% Despite the respect I have for the rapporteur Mr Méndez de Vigo , today I voted no to his report on the Treaty of Nice ; however , this does not mean a no to Europe . #% Are we going to tell farmers that they can not engage in this legitimate trade ? #% To achieve that we must first understand the effects of fishing practices on the marine environment and promote fishing activities that are environmentally sustainable . #% I would specifically like to draw Members ' attention to the question of whether we elect the President of the Commission or whether we approve the nomination of the President of the Commission . #% This is the overwhelming view of the vast majority of European Union Governments as well as being the strong opinion of the European Parliament . #% But we must be careful and remember that an extensive amount of work remains to be completed before a European Union Constitutional Treaty is agreed . #% I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio , and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection . #% Commissioner Busquin ' s communication on the European research area is very good . #% The scheme categorises products and services that range from tissue paper to footwear to campsites . #% I accept Commissioner Verheugen 's explanation that he was speaking in a German context and in a personal capacity . #% The enormous sea change in legislation alone to comply with the is something that no existing Member State could achieve in such a short time . #% I have always maintained that on certain issues exchange of best practice and standard setting at EU level can often reap positive results . #% Emergency aid in the short term must be backed up with longer-term aid to help the future generations recover from this most horrific ordeal . #% I salute their courage and bravery in endeavouring to get justice for their brother . #% I believe that , if we are to have a real and fruitful discussion about social policy , we have to ask the fundamental questions and the difficult questions relating to EU macroeconomic policy . #% The Sudanese Government has shown no willingness to protect internally displaced persons . #% I conclude by saying that all nuclear nations need to state clearly and honestly their programmes for Y2K date compliance , to assure their own and neighbouring nations of their readiness . #% I welcome the proposal to devote a quarter of the budget to the digital divide . #% Mr President , I should just like to endorse what other people have said about giving the Sakharov Prize to Mr Gusmão . #% The challenge to achieve cohesion will be greater : we have an unprecedented expansion of the Union and we still have poor regions . #% Let us remind ourselves that the Lisbon special EU Summit in March set us new targets and deadlines to make better use of the Internet , strengthening Europe ' s competitiveness in the knowledge economy . #% I congratulate this motion for deploring violence , for its support of the UN and AU missions to Sudan . #% Nothing will be achieved if we take with one hand and give with another . #% I would underscore again that extreme caution is needed in biotechnology . #% However , what is happening with legal bases ? #% Your contribution this morning was devoid of Eurospeak . #% Instead , a diverse coalition was able to exploit unfounded fears , resulting in its rejection and untold harm being inflicted on Ireland 's position within the EU and damaging our relations with applicant states . #% The Member States are unwilling to concede to the European Union the full responsibility for a comprehensive policy but are always willing to blame the European Union for the negative factors . #% It was of course disappointing that the British Conservative rapporteur informed me of his decision to abandon these important provisions for consumers and users in order to achieve political expediency . #% We have a specific problem of demographics , geography and lack of infrastructure , and no indigenous packaging industry , with 80 % of our packaged goods being imported . #% Little wonder the tide of Euro-scepticism continues to rise . #% When you try and bring the different players together you can achieve a result that nobody thought possible . #% Unless we succeed in reaching a fair consensus on the level of financial support for sheep farming , this attempt at reform will fail and the decline of sheep production will lead to a significant imbalance in the European meat sector , thereby putting greater pressure on the beef sector as farmers switch from one enterprise to another . #% Finally , we need to step up our actions in the regions . #% Many practitioners of conventional medicine realize that traditional medicine has a lot to offer and reasonable , independent-minded people must realize that our whole future health and well-being undoubtedly lies in a good mixture of the two . #% The UK and the US should pause and reflect before they embark on a course of action without UN authority . #% Increased production should only be contemplated in those sectors where a ready market can be found for the produce , and in this regard agriculture must prepare itself to meet the challenges of the world marketplace . #% It is essential that there is both earmarked money for international cooperative research - we suggest EUR 400 million - and mainstreaming across all the research , particularly on HIV/AIDS malaria and tuberculosis . #% It is important for patients to have access to information on the medicine that they are taking but I feel that this type of advertising would undermine the doctor 's role as gatekeeper and may damage their responsibility to patients . #% There is an obligation on manufacturers to bear the whole or a large part of the cost of implementing these measures and for them to take back end-of-life vehicles at no charge to the last owner . #% Premarital arrangements might be a good idea simply to concentrate the mind . #% That is why we are deeply upset - particularly in my group - about the very small budget we are being given to try to implement what is , in fact , one of the great success stories of the Community . #% This should be supported , and a proper evaluation of what has already been imposed conducted , before any new decisions are taken that will have a discriminatory effect on the Northern Ireland fishing fleet . #% I feel there are inadequacies in the scoreboard itself . #% It is irresponsible for anyone to suggest that this is in the interests of consumers . #% Today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there . #% One final point I would like to make is that the value of an electoral observation exercise is seriously diminished if there is no follow-up . #% Thanks to the pragmatism of our rapporteur , Bert Doorn , and good cooperation with the Commission and Presidency , we now have a flexible EU instrument that will raise the quality and consistency of audits across Europe while also respecting the good domestic company law provisions already in place . #% While welcoming bench-marking and sharing best practice at Union level , we see such measures as complementary to , but no substitute for , structural adjustment in labour , product and service markets and employment-friendly tax policy at Member State level . #% I now believe that the Irish presidency must give priority to persuading Member States to agree on a funding package for the trans-European networks to ensure that they are put in place as quickly as possible . #% Now that culture was breached quite clearly at Tokaimura this week . #% 
Shelter for ordinary people can be constructed through a strong common agricultural policy which ensures high-quality food at reasonable prices without negative impacts on the environment . #% author . - Mr President , in the brutal war of the Sri Lanka Government against the Tamil minority , at least 40 000 Tamils were killed within the space of a few weeks and hundreds of thousands were detained in open air prison camps . #% This would seem to be a very good opportunity to get one state at least to be more cooperative with international legal norms . #% I hope , over the next few months , that we will have an opportunity to impress upon our colleagues in Parliament and ministers in the various Member States the importance to us . #% The EU 2005 programme must be fully implemented so as to increase broadband access to schools and libraries and ensure that all our young people are guaranteed access to high-speed Internet services and development skills . #% It is important that we back the Commissioner 's proposal for a centre for communicable diseases , but we should be insisting that every Member State put money up front for this centre . #% Furthermore , the establishment of the Rapid Reaction Force under the Amsterdam Treaty has worried some people that it will bring to an end Ireland 's military neutrality . #% It is quite clear that by the discussions here today we are setting up a European military state with its own arms industry , and neutral countries such as Ireland should be well aware of this . #% I want clarity on this . #% We expect the European Union to continue negotiations , maintaining our strong positions on all these issues and using our links with countries in the developing world to ensure that the next round is a fair round . #% For instance , to say that a fish was caught in a fishery which is sustainable or responsibly managed is utterly meaningless , because one person 's definition of ` responsible ' may differ very much from another 's . #% In parts of the European Union at this moment people drive two hours to work in their cars , two hours home and live in overcrowded circumstances . #% Moreover , women are less likely to be re-employed when they lose their jobs . #% The Commission and Europe can act as the honest broker in bringing together these sides to ensure that we deliver the best possible remedies for people within the European Union . #% Lets go for real debt relief , that is cancellation of their debts . #% Equally , there is an urgent need to moderate the language of politics in Northern Ireland . #% In saying `` postpone it '' we are saying we want to take command of what is in it - not to sweep it under the carpet . #% Yet I have to say that in all my political life I have never seen so much anger as I saw in my constituency and across the border in Northern Ireland over the weekend . #% Finally , President Prodi , I ask you to read today 's , which carries an interview with you on the occasion of your visit to Ireland yesterday . #% Many countries are light-years ahead of the Community . #% I would stress the importance of identifying gaps in knowledge and ensuring that any initiatives necessary to fill such gaps are well thought out and capable of delivering the required outcomes . #% We have three standing committees and perhaps we could on some selective audit basis pick some aspects of these and examine them . #% in writing . - Firstly I wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work . #% Mr President , in Europe today , education has increased in importance beyond all recognition . #% Ultimately , however , our fleets must remain competitive in the long term . #% Mr President , in conjunction with the other speakers , I wish to congratulate Mr Burtone on the tremendous work he has done on this report . #% Now that she has returned , she might withdraw her statement . #% Madam President , the people that I represent have no confidence whatsoever in Commissioner Patten as far as law and order is concerned . #% A democracy , by its very nature , needs the safety valve of humour and offence in order to operate properly . #% EU-wide experiences of the use of biomass for producing energy , involving both renewable raw materials and organic farm waste , should be pooled so that the most viable initiatives can be replicated across Europe . #% You should make sure that you use all the budget that is set aside each year already under the existing programme . #% I know that Commissioners often say that Parliament does not take its role seriously . #% As with the Irish language , there has been a great interest in it and more people are speaking Scotch-Irish today than have spoken it for many years . #% The reference in the draft Rural Charter to a fresh reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is something that causes me some concern . #% We accept the logical reason that you have given , but I have to ask you a further question . #% - Commissioner Byrne , at his hearing stated that : the future of public health policies should not be linked only to the present crisis of the day ; that there must be a high level of human health protection in all Community policies ; that we must be proactive in public healthcare . #% It has other facets : basic social need and environmental impact . #% As the previous speaker said , the British Government has had these implemented perfectly from day one , as it always does , while everybody else lags behind . #% Even though horses are not initially reared for human consumption , they do end up in the human food chain . #% It may be that under law they do not qualify for refugee status , but if this is so they should get it , and they should still be allowed to remain in Ireland in any case . #% It is my hope particularly that the Irish Commissioner , Ms Geogheghan Quinn , takes a leading role in the new commission with her innovation and research portfolio . #% We as socialists are very supportive of the amendments put forward by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and others . #% Mr Belder is absolutely right , however , to say that the programme is currently inefficient , ineffective and certainly lacks a solid legal base . #% We must also remember that there are wider provisions for closer coordination of economic policies in general between the Member States of the Union . #% In certain cases it is also where child abuse takes place and we know that children have been abused in schools and institutions . #% Nevertheless , it is important that we maintain pressure on the Chinese Government to improve the political and human rights situation in China . #% Some countries want the rules governing the operation of the single currency regime to be opened up and made more flexible . #% High-wire negotiations only lead to mistrust . #% Like the great majority of the people on the island of Ireland , I have always aspired to a united Ireland . #% The EQF , by acting as a translation tool for national authorities , will undoubtedly help our constituents to overcome this senseless discrimination . #% This approach should also be continued . #% The entirely innocent people who were accidentally present at the time of the murder have been obliged to remain silent about these events : in effect to become accomplices in the crime of these thugs and criminals . #% While there could be certain aspects of Parliament 's adopted report that ECR MEPs do not support , we strongly believe that the legal basis of this regulation should be changed to fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative process and additionally , that it should be accompanied by a thorough impact assessment . #% It is unacceptable that the industry could be allowed on exemption unless the environmental risk provisions apply . #% Who is going to take care of us when the time comes - not just financially but also with the love and attention that the elderly need at that stage in their lives . #% Every step of the industry 's chain of production is regulated , ` from farm to fork ' so to speak . #% Mr President , in 2002 this Parliament agreed a resolution not to pursue scientific and technical cooperation with Israel because of the violent and shocking situation in the Middle East at the time . #% It seems to me that one thing we can add is the notion that we are not going to destroy terrorism by simply killing or imprisoning those who carry out these acts . #% Even things like the Geneva Convention are being pushed aside in the interests of keeping people out of Europe . #% Unfortunately , companies have already been developing and patenting cloning techniques . #% It is important that the EU embark on the pension reform process so as to be able to cater for pension payments in the future . #% The Commission should ensure that no public health side effects arise from the uncontrolled recycling of PVC products . #% Quite frankly , I think the way we are going about our business as we head into the 21st century is a lot better than the way we went about our business heading into the 20th century . #% The longer we allow the confusion to exist , the greater the delay in enabling society to benefit from its full potential . #% This should come under the articles of Europol , the European police agency in The Hague . #% Water pricing was always going to be a sensitive aspect to this Directive . #% 
The implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service . #% To the extent that we are the custodians of the public interest in such a crucial area , we must act with extreme care and reflect and respect the views of our citizens . #% I should like to refer very briefly to some of the points highlighted . #% In the light of tomorrow 's debate on the competitiveness of the EU industries generally and Commissioner Bangemann 's action plan on the competitiveness of the European textile industry , would you not agree that Eurocoton 's complaint belongs to the past for our industries ? #% I do not agree with my Irish colleague , Mr Hyland , that it is in anybody ' s interest to produce something for destruction . #% Basically what we are doing is promoting the whole attitude of xenophobia and victimising people who are already victims . #% If a renewed transatlantic partnership is desirable it is certainly not going to be easy to achieve because of the ongoing differences between many EU governments and the present US administration . #% We are trying to work with the problems that all this creates . #% We have an array of legislative measures which should go a long way to preventing future outbreaks and , more importantly , to ensuring that any such outbreak does not reach the proportions witnessed last year . #% Groups and anti-racist organisations in my region , in the North-West of England , are eagerly awaiting this legislation . #% However , I recognize that the reference to an eight-year term for the president is no more for all of us than a fiction , since clearly Mr Duisenberg is unlikely to serve for that length by his own admission . #% If we did not have this agreement this migratory species would not be conserved for the benefit of the local fishermen and would probably be exploited in any case . #% However , we have decided to vote in favour as there are a lot of positive elements in the report , particularly its emphasis on renewable energy , which is clean , cost-effective and secure . #% In terms of the complete independence and discretion that should go with this high office , this latter quote is an important reassurance . #% In approving the setting-up of Eurojust , I believe we would be adding a new weapon to take on Europe 's criminal organisations . #% We do not have the right to stop the reunification of Europe to correct the mistakes of history . #% But we must look at the numbers involved relative to the cattle population in each country to make sense , rather than just to panic the consumer . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , this legislation is very necessary as the current legislation on residue control has led to a serious decrease in the availability of authorised veterinary medicines , creating adverse effects for public and animal health and welfare . #% Before any rate is decided on , the first step should be to evaluate the Community 's rural development needs , cost them and then set the appropriate rate to meet the cost . #% The Atlantic Dawn and the Veronica are landing in Las Palmas . #% The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political . #% In the European Union there is free movement of goods , services , persons and capital with full regulation and , indeed , competition checks . #% The nuclear industry is clearly out of control . #% I speak for the part of the Republic of Ireland which lies on the border . #% Last month 's ruling of the ECJ that Ireland is in breach of the EU 's main waste management directive represented a damning indictment of the Government 's environmental record . #% It is a welfare issue , it is a therapeutic issue , it is an economic issue , and it is in every Member State of the EU . #% Community agricultural statistics #% I thank Mrs Green for that explanation . #% In both cases the result of violence over the last few months has achieved the opposite to what was originally intended . #% author . - Madam President , we agree with the general approach of Yannick Jadot to this issue . #% We appear to be doing the same in Kosovo . #% I want to begin by placing emphasis on the question of employment policy , in particular to focus on traded public services - as distinct from the public service in general - and the way in which in employment policy terms they are critical to the creation of sustainable jobs in the Union . #% The statistics are rather frightening . #% We seriously want the socio-economic implications of every piece of research to be looked at in the Fifth Framework Programme . #% Unfortunately , with the European Constitutional Treaty not moving as some of us would have hoped , our competence is fairly limited . #% On the subject of roll call votes , on a personal basis and on behalf of a few other Members of this House , I wish to make the following statement to you and have the matter checked . #% Mr President , I am delighted to be the first man to speak in this debate on International Women 's Day . #% Illegal drugs seem to be readily available nowadays both in terms of quantity and variety , particularly to young people . #% However , I am less supportive of amendments put forward to this proposal which call for the compulsory use of armed in-flight security officers or ` sky marshals ' . #% The general principle should be to ensure that animals are slaughtered as close as possible to the point of production . #% Let me finish by saying this : we need to be cautious as to how we reform our agriculture policy . #% It is undeniably the fact that the use of these drugs causes damage to the user ' s health . #% Mr President , last year when I spoke in this debate , I said that annual reports provide an opportunity not to look backwards , to assign blame and criticize , but to look forward and learn from the difficulties that we have had in programme implementation . #% There is normally a 13 to 14-month laying cycle for hens that go into conventional cages . #% If we have a fixed figure that the European Union needs as own resources , then obviously if we leave the Member States more of what we call the traditional own resources , we have to collect more of that as a percentage of GNP . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I too would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the President-in-Office and President Barroso for their presentations here today . #% In the UK and Ireland there is cross-party support for the Irish peace process , even though from time to time parties have been critical of details . #% When we reform agriculture there will be changes in employment in rural areas . #% Our present growth rate at 11 % is over three times the average of other Member States . #% Taking traffic straight off roads and on to the railway can only be good for the future . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his reply . #% It is no secret that in some countries politicians and the police are profiting from people-trafficking and tipping traffickers off when operations are about to be mounted against them . #% Some of these have been outlined by Mr Miller . #% I share that belief strongly which is why on this occasion I feel at ease in supporting this report and do so in good conscience . #% URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK , in Moss Side . #% These workers are concerned because they understand that such an agreement will be implemented primarily in the economic interests of big business in both Canada and in the European Union and not primarily in the interests of working people or of social justice . #% I agree with those who have called for Parliament to be further involved by way of co-decision rather than just being consulted on an issue which is of such great importance to our citizens . #% The Irish Government has declared the fight against drugs a priority of its presidency . #% It has been clearly stated that no other country has a right to exploit the Saharawi resources without the permission of the Saharawi people . #% I urge the European Commission to act promptly on foot of this report and meet the demands of this democratically elected Parliament to bring forward appropriate measures . #% The Council and the Commission can help us in that regard . #% Terrorism occurs not only when people engage in suicide bombing , but also when members of the security forces operate outside the law . #% It matters to me . #% Consumers can feel at ease that this technology , which is highly monitored and tightly regulated , will ensure that Europeans continue to be the best fed people in today 's world . #% We have to look at this and ask ourselves if it is morally correct . #% 
They have been harassed by the police , their offices and homes have been raided , equipment has been confiscated and the pictures they have taken at protests have been used against protesters in evidence . #% A target of 3 % of GDP on research is realistic and essential , as is the recruitment of far more scientists , including women . #% The Italian presidency would ignore this reality at its peril . #% So there is a huge time-bomb waiting to go off , if , first of all , these landfill sites are not covered by the directive and have been closed down before it enters into effect and , secondly , if no action is taken to ensure that any landfill site is beyond a certain radius from residential areas . #% Farm income in Ireland and many other Member States is very much dependent on the direct income support from the European Union budget . #% In the past two decades or so , many initiatives have been trialled which have been aimed at getting those from demographic groups traditionally disinclined towards university to attend third-level institutions . #% Finally on the Florence process , we must involve the Parliament and we must have some democratic involvement in this process . #% On 19 September a Member of this Parliament , while returning from the session in Strasbourg , was invited to an official function in Florence . #% Mr President , the report before us does a great disservice to the topics it covers , whether one is pro-choice or pro-life , because it purports to dictate to Member States a certain direction in relation to what are most important subsidiarity matters for the Member States . #% I said this last month . #% Of course , our birth rate has fallen remarkably since about 1980 , but we still have one of the highest proportions of young people in our population . #% Governments previously agreed in the secrecy of the Council to have a Services Directive , it was put together and then suddenly pressure was applied and they all backed off and said it must be changed . #% What happened in South-East Asia indicates how urgent this is , and the Commission should now be trying to work for some sort of a treaty base to compel Member States to meet this commitment of 0.7 % . #% We went through terrible times to make our steel competitive . #% This matter is not going to go away . #% The need for business to adapt to a changing agenda , taking more account of environmental concerns , is becoming more widely accepted . #% The vigilance we are rightly demonstrating on the release of genetically modified organisms on the environment and food safety must be intensified with regard to research in the sensitive and ethical area of gene technology and its impact and implications for mankind . #% I raised myself afterwards the question of the soundness of my voting card . #% I rose to ask you to inform me further - as you have already done in writing - about an issue I raised some time back . #% Parliament has certainly devoted considerable time on behalf of its citizens to addressing the important agenda of food safety , while at the same time ensuring that our farmers can operate within a production framework of traceability which is the only way to fully restore consumer confidence in the wide range of quality food products produced by European farmers . #% I know the Commissioner would agree on the need for a framework for energy support . #% Health warnings will take up 40 % of the front of the packet and 50 % of the back . #% A two-speed Europe already exists in at least two areas : namely the Schengen Agreement and the single currency . #% I hope very much that Parliament will clearly indicate their support for the re-introduction of the original time of four years for the inclusion of junior doctors in this directive . #% If they are , they should be prosecuted for it . #% To make it easier for people to support it we have removed the second part . #% Mr President , first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and her excellent cooperation . #% We want to make both these key projects a real success within the Union , and we support enlargement . #% Burning waste and calling it recovery is stretching the imagination to the extreme . #% If there was binding legislation that major European companies had to adhere to , then you would not have the situation we have at present . #% I am particularly pleased that the COOPENER Programme , which is itself modest , will serve as leverage for much better-funded programmes such as those foreseen in Johannesburg . #% The proposals , as they stand , would result in income reductions for Irish farmers , destabilize the structure of family farms , dissuade young people from taking up farming as a profession and would lead to continued rural depopulation . #% in writing . - Access to Early Years Learning is of vital importance to young children in terms of their receptiveness and willingness to learn , especially since important skills such as the ability to speak and develop social skills are formed at a young age . #% We have to demonstrate that the politics of this Union can solve their problems . #% I am sure that you will agree with me that we are going nowhere unless that happens , and that we must do something positive about it . #% Your budgets denied rights and services to the most vulnerable in Irish society . #% I would like a response on that point . #% I look forward very much to hearing what the Council and the Commission propose . #% Our indigenous fossil fuel supplies -- peat and natural gas -- have been rapidly depleting since 1995 , while record economic and industrial growth has pushed up demand . #% I have to say that the Caribbean ambassadors were utterly devastated by this decision . #% The European Council in Göteborg was generous in response to our predicament and I welcome its willingness to help the Irish Government find a way forward . #% I would also like to draw attention to another point that has to be investigated , that is , the rape of many Chinese women in Jakarta during the uprising . #% The sensitivities of Northern Ireland are too important for any ill-informed bandwagoning on the International Fund for Ireland . #% Is the President-in-Office aware that failure to address the issue of promoting a quality sustainable EU wool sector is to concede the European wool industry to our competitors , New Zealand and Australia ? #% Hopefully , it will not be too long before we have details of the proposals . #% Access to such services in a fair and equitable manner is essential for the full functioning of the free market . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report specifically because it urges the Commission to utilise current scientific evidence to protect EU citizens from the potential hazards of electromagnetic fields ( EMFs ) . #% Already there is some evidence that this is happening . #% Farmers need to wake up and stop opposing environmental legislation , such as the nitrates directive , and realise that these laws could protect them against the WTO . #% We now have a majority . #% If we can do that I think we have moved very far . #% There are things that make us different , but they need not divide us if we can show tolerance , respect and understanding for them . #% There has been much debate in recent months about the strength or otherwise of the currency and I would like to pose a very simple question to the detractors of EMU . #% Modulation of EUR 5 000 is unacceptable , even with promises of further investment in rural development . #% However , whatever the consequences for existing EU members , the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must view current developments with growing alarm . #% Madam President , I should like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mrs Lambert on her tremendous work on what was a very difficult brief . #% It is important to root out corruption , but we should be extremely cautious how we present this to our electorate . #% Surely it was to these farmers that schemes such as the retirement scheme were in the first instance directed . #% I believe that the Commission is acting to subvert the will of parliament in imposing such conditions on the grant and consequently , I proposed including a direct reference to the secretariats in Dublin and Brussels in the footnote . #% There is no convincing or compelling reason for these further burdens to be placed on this important sector of our economic production . #% Mr President , I am pleased to participate in this important debate on the enlargement of the European Union and in particular to acknowledge progress on Malta 's application for membership . #% We also invite the government to set up a truth and reconciliation commission , as has been called for by so many in civil society . #% The Commissioner 's relationship with our Parliament and its committees has always been constructive and positive and it should remain so . #% In the Senegal Agreement this requirement is far more constraining so that vessels can lose their licences for failure to comply . #% The debate on the next Multiannual Financial Framework is an opportunity for fundamental reform and it must be seized . #% If we do it now , we may well have to do it in the future in a one-stock fishery . #% 
The long-term effects of the use of ecstasy are still very much unknown , other than we know that ecstasy is still a drug that can cause depression and memory impairment . #% At the end of the day maybe we should consider whether surveillance should become a Community responsibility , because at the moment Member States are not fulfilling their obligation . #% It is a delicate time , whilst an appeal is going on , to be raising what are emotive issues and I understand how difficult it is for you , Commissioner , to give a full outline of what action the Commission would take in future if the death penalty were to be imposed . #% I have submitted a number of amendments to this report to ensure that there will be no reduction in the dissemination of information through public libraries , educational facilities and so on ; that indigenous culture will be preserved and developed ; that the needs of disabled people will not be undermined by this legislation and that the cultural and social importance of major sporting events will be protected . #% I want to say to the House here in the couple of seconds available to me that , in my view , one of the ways of relieving people from the terrible poverty they face is by investing in bringing about land ownership in the developing world . #% Were others notified ? #% in writing . - I fully support the re-election Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros to the office of European Ombudsman . #% Kuwait encroached on Iraqi oilfields and the US Ambassador gave the Iraqi Government the impression that the US would not object to an invasion . #% In fact many people , as we can see from the low turnouts , no longer define themselves in political terms and therefore disengage from the political process . #% in writing . - I would like to commend my colleagues in the Agricultural Committee for this initiative report . #% I will finish by re-echoing what has already been said on border controls : border controls are totally inefficient . #% Finally , I am very disappointed that some of my fellow Irish Members in this House did not feel that they could support this being discussed in Parliament . #% Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , three are fluorinated gases . #% As rapporteur he tried to mellow the severity of the proposals in the beef sector . #% Words are easy , what we need now is for the roadmap to be implemented . #% For some farmers this could be organic farming . #% That is not what his report was meant to be about and he has misused his available time on something that is inappropriate . #% They have agreed for now not to fight each other and to engage in dialogue for peace and reconciliation . #% Thankfully , we got it under control , but it showed what can happen when there are problems . #% I would like to hear a bit more about the European southern laboratory . #% Does the Commissioner have an understanding with Member States that they will not top up their vehicle taxation as a means of recovering income lost as a result of lower prices , thereby wiping out the economic benefit to consumers ? #% Therefore , I wish to put on record now what I was trying to propose . #% Why do you always have to be dragged here as a College , as a President , before the bar of public accountability ? #% I would like to emphasise that the derogations in question are from the timetable and not from the substantive targets . #% Its stability directly impinges on the whole region and the EU has rightly attempted to build contacts and a relationship with this geographically close and significant neighbour . #% Parliament , which is the budgetary authority , is being frustrated in its attempts to obtain the relevant scientific information on this major third country agreement . #% We need good internal links between our major urban centres , and we need good links to our major ports so that our goods can be shipped out effectively and efficiently . #% We need very strong ... #% By having one of our law-making institutions meeting and deciding issues in private , behind closed doors , we are denying the creation and the birth of that political space . #% In Asia many species are unsustainably exploited , either to provide food for the pet trade or because people believe that eating specific animal parts can cure disease or strengthen their sexual capacities . #% On Mrs Beres ' report on universal service for telecommunications : the Liberal Group abstained on this because the definition of universal service was too loose and too broad and references to uncosted funding requirements for such services were too vague . #% It is very much in the interests of better decision-making within the Union to have an effective Council which is transparent and exercises all the duties conferred upon it by the Treaty . #% However , when one considers that there was over 42 million tonnes of waste in Ireland in 1995 I am confident that the innovative proposals to deal with waste management in Ireland will receive a very favourable response from the Commission during the next round of European Union structural funding for the years 2000 to 2006 . #% Own-account truck drivers will work all the hours that they get because they are not sure when they will get another job . #% The legitimate request of the people in Monasterevin , for example , for the re-opening of their train station and the people of Portlaoise for the upgrading of the service is fully justified . #% Mr President , I wish to bring the attention of this Assembly to recent studies on the effects of climate change in particular , which were published in the scientific journal . #% We reach a very small number of questions , and answers are allowed to go on forever . #% If we can not work out the levels of commitment and lay down rules with proper conditions between Parliament , Commission and Council , we run the risk of failing to meet the target and the necessity for reform . #% It is unfortunate that , while so many positive things happened in the latter half of the twentieth century , words such as ` ethnic cleansing ' and ` genocide ' have come into our normal vocabulary . #% Mr President , this is the International Year of Mountains , and I am glad that Mrs Frassoni , our co-Chairman , managed to have this put on the agenda , as it is an essential issue . #% I also wanted to say that this is not the last word , and we reserve the right to reopen some of these compromises if necessary with the Council and the Commission to ensure that mediation truly works for our citizens and that we achieve our objectives . #% I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes , even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met . #% I just do not understand this . #% But who will speak for the lonely and the unfairly treated ? #% Unfortunately , I have to say that most of the saints are gone . #% I would like to give the honourable Member the assurance that we will do everything in our power to ensure that the question he raises is addressed and that this problem is examined well in advance . #% We take your words at face value , but we will not accept them forever . #% I fully support the view that is necessary to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the treaties of the Union , so as to further enhance the rights of citizens of Europe . #% The car industry itself admits - and none of us can be happy about this - that it has not been proactive in the past 22 years . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by adding my words of welcome to the McCartney family here this evening in our House , and pay tribute to their courage , strength and determination in what they have achieved and in what they have tried to do . #% I hope , therefore , that this will be taken seriously and Mrs Lenz 's report will be supported by all groups . #% Israeli security will not be obtained by building an ` apartheid wall ' , which has less to do with security than with Ariel Sharon 's long-standing plan to annex Palestinian territory . #% The proposed Constitution is the fulfilment of that dream , to be pursued , if necessary , without those states where nationalistic chauvinism still rules . #% A quarter of a million tonnes of edible fish being used for animal feed is excessive . #% It is heartening to see so many agricultural MEPs here from all the groups supporting the protection of agriculture . #% In today 's Irish Times Wicklow County Council admits to the existence of up to 88 illegal dumps , 19 of which have not even been examined yet . #% As a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , I am used to investing time and effort in an issue now in order to benefit future generations . #% Mr President , I compliment Mr Olsson on his work and may I commence by again putting on the record my support , and that of my Irish colleagues , for EU enlargement . #% I think that we have to begin to toughen up on the need to apply sanctions or suspend agreements if we are going to make progress in this area . #% What is worse , new policyholders were solicited and presented with a false impression of a company with a secure future in which their funds would prosper . #% By stating explicitly now what we feel the common average should be we allow the Council to say : that is too high . #% This is the last opportunity that I will have to thank Commissioner Byrne for all his help and great leadership over many crises over the last five years . #% Despite the high profile case of novelist Elif Shafak , which was thrown out of court last week , self-censorship will continue to be forced upon the press until Article 301 is done away with entirely . #% The vested interests that produce these should be legally liable for insuring people 's health if something goes wrong . #% It is a very balanced report . #% The European textile industry has global advantages and these must be developed and strengthened . #% 
That continues to place Irish citizens at a disadvantage , as Aarhus is the world 's most far-reaching treaty on environmental rights and guarantees public rights to access to information and public participation in environmental decision making . #% That is why I voted against recital 25 . #% Yet the number of `` no '' votes was smaller than before , not larger , and so in this regard we should retain a sense of proportion . #% This makes it rather difficult for us to do our work on separate votes and split votes in time . #% This Parliament has repeatedly pointed out to the Commission and the Council over many years that there is an urgent need for a directive on a framework for services of general economic interest . #% . I , like other Members of the House , fully understand the desire to see closer cooperation between the judicial authorities in all the Member States . #% I hope that the ratification of the Nice Treaty proceeds successfully , and that when we revisit the issue in Ireland , we will have a different result . #% Mr President , I agree with the tenor and the thrust of the McKenna report . #% in writing . - Renegotiation of the EU budget will impact on how the Union operates in the coming years and on the programmes it can afford . #% Why not some standing groups , on a rotating basis , who would be ready to go into the area when these sort of things occur ? #% It is totally unacceptable that Gilad Shalit has been denied his rights as a prisoner of war to which the Goldstone Report categorically states he is entitled . #% I do not believe that this would serve any constructive purpose . #% At the dawn of the 21st century , we should send a message to the world that the EU recognises the ability in all , the right to equal treatment and equal access to opportunity . #% One of the fundamentals of the CAP is to guarantee a secure supply of high-quality foodstuffs for our citizens and I hope that the Commission will take on board the concerns of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , which will no doubt be supported by a strong majority in this House tomorrow . #% So the accession countries have to be warned about the possibility of sanctions being imposed on them if they continue to violate human rights . #% The only people who could be happy with these disgraceful delays are those involved in the illegal drugs trade . #% Two things worry the farmers of Europe at the moment : the excessive paperwork they are required to do and the restrictions that are being imposed on them . #% The issues raised by the honourable Member have much merit and should be examined and advanced at an early stage . #% Irish and European industries need to be assisted in turning a declining sugar industry into a profitable alternative energy source , such as biofuel . #% We need to ensure that our young people have opportunities to learn and to move abroad to continue their learning if they wish , as investing in education today will better equip the EU to face challenges in the future . #% Let us take the reform of the sugar sector , for example . #% Over the years of our existence we have managed to put in place environmental and social rules alongside trade rules . #% So there really is an urgent need to tackle coastal zone management . #% The killings are similar in method and consequence to previous clashes in 2001 , 2004 and 2008 . #% Following the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco , this new protocol with Mauritania is obviously of key significance . #% It is also clear that the Government is using the pretext of the crackdown on terrorism as a means of suppressing Government opponents and critics . #% We must get the balance right : protect the natural beauty , heritage and environment that give an area its attraction , while at the same time make the most of natural assets to improve the local economy . #% Equally , security standards must be provided and improved so as to protect the interests of consumers at all times . #% The cheap smuggled tobacco has produced new smokers among the young people in the United Kingdom . #% It is a display of contempt for the Members of this House for the Council to seek simply to push aside important questions which individual Members may want to raise . #% The resolution urges the Commission to verify Member States ' correct transposition , implementation and national enforcement of the directive and to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving the directive and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible , notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories . #% I wish to congratulate the rapporteur in her absence on an excellent report , which , I believe , is a very significant contribution to the debate . #% For certain programmes the backlog of outstanding commitments is equivalent to more than eight-and-a-half years of payments . #% We need to see that there are no hidden subsidies in EU countries that hamper fair competition between shipbuilding countries . #% There are now people in this Parliament who know what it is like not to have freedom to speak , not to have the freedom to use their own language and not to have the right to teach their own history and culture to their children . #% Human rights clauses have been included in EU international or trade agreements for more than 50 years . #% The only thing that has changed is its PR approach . #% The half-a-degree temperature rise is similar to that observed at the end to the twentieth century . #% If it were only a question of the exchange rate , then prices should also go down with exchange rate variables . #% Regrettably , I am unable to add the name of the Council and the Presidency to the list of those I would like to thank . #% Therefore Member states are encouraged to reprogramme their Structural Funds Operational Programmes in order to devote a better balance to energy efficiency investments , including where they fund social housing . #% The reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is used inappropriately in the report . #% I think a big part of our crackdown on the corrupt is to take them out within the developed world first and then perhaps assist the rooting-out of corruption in the developing world . #% We have had many false dawns in the past regarding the permanent political solution in Northern Ireland . #% - At the outset , I would like to place on the record my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur Mr Lehne on the way he had dealt with this difficult brief . #% These people do not want this life ; they want peace and safety for their families and a chance to live their lives . #% Some mistakes were also made for political reasons . #% There are a number of other serious implications arising from parttime work which should be brought to the attention of the Commission . #% I also wish to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on his very able handling of an extremely difficult brief and report . #% Part of his question was to put down yet again a marker in the sand about the fact that the members of the European Parliament 's delegation , as part of the EU delegation , will be treated as second-class citizens . #% As you know yourself , with regard to your own country , peripheral areas and islands suffer unique disadvantages and hazards that must be responded to in a common and complex way . #% The European Parliament must and should use these new powers to push forward an even stronger legislation in the area of environmental control . #% I know Members are making comments for reasons other than that they expect me to respond . #% Decreasing the usage of cigarettes in the Union serves only a positive function in terms of protecting the health of all our citizens . #% I refer to these as ` home carers ' , and will continue to do so for the rest of my time here . #% We must all work together to put behind us the tragic events that have taken place in the Balkans since the 1990s . #% Larger firms are , of course , aware of this . #% I firmly believe that if European citizens and businesses are to reap the full benefits of this internal market , then they have to be able to trust in efficient , cheap and secure payments . #% Madam President , I would like to thank you and the Bureau for the swift action that you have taken in relation to this matter in inviting Patricia McKenna , as a Member of this House , to produce the evidence to substantiate the case that she alleged yesterday in an Irish newspaper . #% I pose the question , and not for the first time , what happens following decoupling if the projected price increase in the market place does not materialise ? #% For example , there is the pigmeat industry where we produce 18 million tons of pigmeat annually and we end up in a situation where there is a million tons in surplus . #% Nevertheless , an ambitious timetable has been set for reaching major agreements on the reform of the common agricultural policy , the regional and social funds and the budget . #% But the essential points are that it does not take soil or climatic conditions into consideration and , most critically , that the goal of the Nitrates Directive should be defined at Community level but not the mechanism to achieve that goal . #% I also firmly believe that the information contained on the blacklist needs to be easily accessible and widely available to all stakeholders ( national civil aviation authorities , all EU airports and of course passengers ) . #% I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage . #% The integrity of this House demands detailed answers to questions which raise major doubts about aspects of a regulation upon which the motion before us is based and on which we will be asked to vote tomorrow . #% 
There can be no doubt that Ireland 's economic success would not have happened , and could not be sustained , outside the framework of EU membership . #% Having consistently criticised the United States for its one-sided approach which meant that it was exacerbating the situation by becoming part of the problem instead of part of the solution , I regret that the PPE-DE Group is putting itself in a similar position . #% We must stop the Serb minority in Kosovo . #% If we can not protect our future which is our children , what point is there in protecting the present ? #% Unemployment is falling within the European Union and in Ireland it stands at a little over 6 % of the population . #% I have also come across and been approached by constituents about a situation where special offers are offered , for example in the UK , which are not available to somebody coming , for example , from Ireland to pick up the tour in the UK . #% The devastation caused by the earthquake is hard to comprehend , even after seeing repeated pictures of the suffering on our media screens and newspapers . #% I welcome the wide-ranging speech that the Taoiseach made to the House , which covered many key issues with which this House is concerned . #% I believe you should not launch your project in such a sea of political and institutional ambiguity . #% In particular , as we look to move forward and create a new environment for the creation of new jobs and new opportunities for people within the European Union , we believe that going back over old policies which have failed and rejuvenating them under a new name will not work . #% Enlargement challenges all of us to rediscover Europe 's essential task . #% I do not think it makes much difference if we made it eight or ten hours , but we have to decide something . #% It is not surprising that Belize is there , considering last year ' s revelations about Michael Ashcroft , the Tory Party treasurer ' s business connections there . #% Ireland has identified the tourism sector as one area where it is possible to generate economic growth and new job opportunities for our young people . #% Finally , I am indeed pleased that the European Parliament has been given the power of codecision by the Amsterdam Treaty , with the European Council of Health Ministers , on all new proposals for European legislation in the area of public health and human health . #% The negotiators will have to move into a higher gear if they are to reach successful conclusions . #% We should be using the money properly - of course to increase infrastructure , to provide better services and to increase local employment as much as possible - but it should not be used merely as a substitute for private and other investments or for other initiatives to create local employment . #% Wild fish stocks in the European Union are about 40 % of what our consumers in the Union need . #% Having approached the whole of the negotiations in a way that sought to accommodate , I was very disappointed that , on one particular issue , my views were not accommodated . #% But I have to say that the continuing campaign in Great Britain against the import of Irish beef is and must be a matter of concern for all committed Members of the European Union . #% Such provisions are to be inserted in the directives on waste , the protection of waters against nitrate pollution as well as being included in the hazardous waste , copper packaging , air quality and landfill of waste directives . #% I would like to point out that 70 Congressmen sent a letter to Bill Clinton in the United States asking him to lift the embargo , asking him to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place in Iraq . #% But we have some questions that arise from the hearings and some observations . #% Mr President , the four reports being discussed today concern fisheries in widely different areas of the globe : the Antarctic , the Baltic Sea , eastern Canada and here in Europe . #% I agree with all those who said that this business of reform must be finished before the next European election because then there will be a new Parliament , a new Europe after enlargement and a new Commission . #% Now the Commission says that the farmers must repay this money which prevented cruelty to animals . #% Up to 60 such cases are currently being brought against writers by the State Prosecutor . #% Its rapid growth of jurisdiction is the political mystery of the age . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , may I join with the Commissioner in expressing my sympathy to the people of Nigeria on the death of President Umaru Yar ` Adua . #% I do not believe that support from the citizens of the Union for the EU extends to the area of deciding taxation levels in Europe . #% Mr President , I am delighted to see that at the European Council meeting in Brussels last week , the 25 Heads of State and Government joined together in congratulating His Holiness , Pope John-Paul II on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his Pontificate . #% For yourself and the leader of a political group to invite him and for him to turn you down would imply that somehow he is refusing to come before this House . #% Both sides agreed that meetings would be held twice a year . #% Why should we over-fish and , at the same time , import a product which creates a price that is unacceptable ? #% I welcome the Langen report 's inclusion of the Environment Committee 's request that the Commission introduce a mandatory and comprehensive certification system . #% Their role in society is not always sufficiently recognized , in particular at a time when reward for work is generally measured in terms of money . #% We talk about forced labour and child labour in various parts of Asia and we condemn them , quite rightly so . #% Child obesity is a serious problem in Ireland and in Europe and this problem must be effectively tackled head-on . #% Madam President , Hamas is evil : it is responsible for some of the most vile terrorist attacks ever witnessed . #% We have a democracy in Ireland , a funny type of democracy : it decides who will be elected and who will not . #% I am glad that we will now have a further opportunity to deal with this in the September plenary session , on the basis of a UPE Group oral question . #% I am a diabetic and were it not for biotechnology from the liver of a poor innocent pig I would be a dead man today . #% Madam President , the presentation by the Council of a first EU annual report on human rights was a welcome contribution to the on-going debate . #% It is essential that the Commission does its utmost to enforce the terms of trade agreements where exporters to the EU comply with international norms on workers ' rights and environmental standards . #% Gestures will not halt his aggression any more than our words or resolutions . #% I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment who supported the compromise package and the Council for recognising the importance of this compromise and for putting the recommendation on COREPER 's agenda at very short notice . #% There are two points of criticism that my colleagues and my Group have asked to seek clarification on today . #% We witnessed yesterday a profoundly shocking event . #% The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has also been severely disrupted . #% There might be a perception that the IFI is an American programme while the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is a European one . #% Mr Ó Neachtain 's report in committee was very good , but , unfortunately , it was voted down by a few votes because Spanish Members voted for their own interests - just like the Irish . #% Having said that , it can not be ruled out that any horse could enter the food chain at the end of its useful life and therefore safeguards are necessary to cover this aspect , as I have already mentioned . #% Hence the ultimate aim is waste prevention , thus sustainability . #% Our Union must continue to play an active role in putting in place and consolidating a permanent peace agreement in the Middle East . #% European taxpayers ' money was given to the Bord Iascaigh Mhara to do this research . #% If we are to develop a Europe in which our people have a share , we must give them a role in creating that Europe and sharing that Europe . #% The only concerted action by countries inside and outside the European Union can hope to check these dangers effectively . #% I give you the example of the now famous International Rice Bank where research into cross-breeding of many out of use and local strains of rice has led to the development of a new variety which is now showing up to a seven-fold yield improvement . #% We should be talking about sectoral targets for CO2 emissions and here transport is one of the biggest sinners . #% I urge the Irish Government to take action under the Convention to stop these shipments . #% The Commission seems to base its findings on certain research but to ignore other research that is available . #% The quota and the TACs which the Irish , sharing their prolific fishing grounds with the larger countries , receive was a bad deal . #% We must vote against this amendment . #% This will immediately mean more controls and inspections and less time for the farmer to tend his stock . #% 50 000 such packets were seized at a house in Oldham . #% The most effective method of achieving a substantial reduction in emissions would be through a European Unionwide CO2 tax . #% 
The enthusiasm and determination of the candidate countries seeking to join the EU provide the clearest proof that the European Union is an enormous success story . #% Other countries have had similar experiences . #% The fact that most , if not all , of the people involved in this murder are either members or supporters of the IRA or Sinn Féin in no way excuses their actions . #% Mr President , I also wish to join with the others in thanking the rapporteur for his work on a very important topic which has become even more so in the last year because of the increase in unemployment across many economies in the European Union . #% It is therefore our overwhelming duty in this House to decouple Europe from this institutional embarrassment at the earliest available date and the only means to do that is to take the available Commission - and I do not prejudge how the hearings may go - and do our utmost to make sure that it takes up office at the earliest available date . #% Has this legislation achieved its objective or , on the contrary , has it led to distortion and fragmentation of the internal market ? #% At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen ' s representatives , duly accredited , travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared . #% Where we diverge somewhat , is with regard to what should actually be in that final resolution and draft Statute . #% They are looking for exactly the same conditions as those regions that left Objective 1 in 2000 . #% The Commission will continue to cooperate and grant aid for various projects aimed at promoting human rights in Turkey . #% These are now being included in the report by Mr Mantovani . #% My concern is that the Single European Act , which both countries have ratified , obliged all members who ratified it to eliminate all borders by 1 January 1992 . #% We had to cancel it , even though you had earlier said that you would attend . #% We can tap into the expertise of the various nations in the various regions of the world . #% We have here in Europe a unique model of family farming which , with falling incomes , is now under serious threat . #% There are certainly many people who believe that qualified majority voting and codecision procedures should be used to tackle immigration issues . #% We need to be realistic in order to meet the objective of advancing these projects , particularly when the number of priority projects has increased from 14 to 30 . #% This is not child pornography but gross and indecent sexual abuse . #% It is important to bear in mind that we can not predict now where the next conflict might arise , the number of people in immediate danger , nor their particular circumstances . #% That was to keep pressure on companies to decrease their emissions . #% As far as ethical principles are concerned , I welcome the more specific language to reinforce the principle of voluntary unpaid donations of cells and tissues . #% As regards organs , Parliament has accepted that this directive is not the appropriate place in which to deal with organ transplants . #% I have another question . #% There is a cardiac condition known as Chernobyl heart , where young children who should be full of health and full of life suffer severe heart attacks and strokes because of the impact of radiation and the fallout they have in their own systems . #% I have only one small query and that concerns the ongoing difficulties in both countries with abandoned and orphaned children and children and young people with disabilities . #% In fact , there is strong evidence to suggest that it has assisted and sponsored attacks on refugee camps . #% The Dutch Government intends to carry out 17 more shipments in the coming years . #% The Council gave scant regard to over 50 amendments adopted by this House in the first reading . #% I find worrying the noises the Americans are now making in this respect and I believe they are trying to move the goalposts regarding farming . #% Little wonder it is the richest party in Ireland . #% It incites women to a pursuit of perfection with consequences like eating disorders . #% Ireland went down a similar road in the 1980s . #% I am reminded of the saying ` give a man a fish and you feed him for a day , but teach a man to fish and you feed him for life ' . #% The EU must take a firm stance against governments that are exercising blatantly corrupt methods of governance . #% It is my experience that the Independent Newspaper Group , in which these comments appeared , does not accept clarifications or corrections from those of us who do not agree with its political line . #% I hope that as the Commission itself contemplates the sensitivities in agriculture relating to the World Trade Organisation and to the agricultural reform debate , the sequencing of those debates will not be allowed to get in the way of the trade-related initiative . #% In the EPP we have put the family at the centre of our thinking . #% The euro coming into operation provides an opportunity to simplify the bureaucratic procedures . #% . Mr President , obviously it will not be possible in five minutes to do justice to the issue . #% It is even more difficult when there are no support mechanisms to help the industry find a way forward . #% The key elements of this Agency are its research and distribution of best practice to Member States in relation to standards concerning health and safety at work . #% It is about their families and their families ' futures , their way of life -- the only one possible in many areas -- and the future of entire coastal communities . #% I do not know where the honourable Member has been for the last few minutes but he certainly has not drawn that conclusion from anything I have said here . #% I supported the amendments aimed at promoting cooperation rather than the open method of cooperation . #% There has been a clear shift in the public mindset in relation to recycling in Ireland . #% Fundamental reform of the CAP at this stage is neither necessary nor desirable . #% in writing . - When this House considers budget priorities , it does so in the context of massive public sector cuts in EU Member States , rising unemployment , increasing household bills and overall economic uncertainty , both nationally and in many families . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner a question concerning the 2002 rapid alerts . #% Shannon Airport has been unreasonably treated in this regard and has been the loser , because it has now been decided by the American authorities not to use the airport for refuelling purposes , at a cost of EUR 10 million to the revenue of that airport . #% There is a lot of discussion at the moment in Parliament and beyond about farmers receiving a fair and stable income for what they produce . #% The slaughter of civilians in Afghanistan by NATO forces and by Western-supplied armaments in Pakistan , apart from being criminal in itself , can push some civilians into the arms of the reactionary groups . #% That , of course , distorts the employment criteria and , indeed , our unemployment figures . #% It is a criminal offence to own this pornography , and very often the people using it are only pretending they are collecting it for the police . #% It is a separate question . #% It is important to stress that these regions , despite the progress , are still structurally and infrastructurally handicapped . #% This is not a trivial matter . #% This makes it easy for the public to access and locate information and is very welcome . #% That we have close to 70 million people living at risk in the European Union is a shameful statistic and is not acceptable . #% Cigarette smuggling has almost replaced drug trafficking , due to the enormous profit margins that can be exploited without the same degree of risk in terms of penal sanctions . #% Could I ask the President-in-Office whether he intends to place this on the agenda and make it clear to the Israeli Government that the Association Agreement can be suspended and that even tougher action , such as a trade embargo , could be put in place if this kind of activity does not stop . #% As a result , it should now be possible to identify clearly what has been paid for . #% From an Irish perspective , I am particularly satisfied that this programme is advancing at a very swift pace . #% Let us not pretend that this will be enough resources to provide for the enlargement of the European Union and meet the needs of the states which expect to become full members . #% Effective coordination requires a reliable and comprehensive store of knowledge on diagnosis and treatment of infectious equine diseases . #% I hope that avoids any confusion during the vote . #% Any food labelling policy must be accurate and dependable for both the producers and the consumers . #% 
However , that said , I believe that the committee 's work has been useful in outlining and exposing all of the facts that are available to date , and certain facts are available . #% Concerns which have been raised , for example on the diversion trade in generic medicines , are being tackled . #% That is something that is very important . #% Secondly , as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in ? #% If we are truly to bring about the idea of the single market , and if we are truly to live up to the principles of the freedom of movement of persons , than we must dismantle these barriers , which we can see are not so much at a European Union institution level but are actually at Member State level and indeed in some Member States at the level of certain individual professions . #% To vote in favour of the Stauner report is to vote for postponement of granting discharge which , all things considered , we believe should be granted now . #% There is a clear and demonstrable link between growth and research and development . #% Proposals and recommendations in response to the Green Paper on fisheries policy were produced by the Irish national strategy review group on the common fisheries policy , which was set up by the marine minister and included stakeholders . #% Mr President , I welcome both Commissioner Patten 's contribution to this debate and Kofi Annan 's decision to send a fact-finding team to ascertain exactly what happened during the Israeli bombardment of Jenin refugee camp . #% That mistrust is to some degree - and maybe unintentionally - fostered by the national authorities and departments who represent the Commission as the oppressive force which is responsible for all the regulation . #% Why , if quotas are being observed , do we need such emphasis on tonnage ? #% I am glad to see that our fishing agreements with developing countries combine some financial aid with a commitment to improving structures and training facilities and providing better opportunities for local fishermen . #% It would seem they would prefer to forget the events in Tiananmen Square and yet at the same time they will protest loud and long about the denial of democracy and human rights in other parts of the world with which they have no significant trade . #% Commissioner , I will send you a copy of this independent documentary , which shows that my constituent did not have a fair trial and that there was a severe problem with the police investigation . #% We need to constrain them , not develop them . #% If we want to achieve our Lisbon goals of making Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2020 , we need a truly unified internal market in our major energy resources . #% We were the first committee to commission our own impact assessment , under Mr Whitehead 's chairmanship , for amendments on the Toubon report on nominal quantities for pre-packed products . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I want to correct a misconception about the Irish Constitution which , it has been alleged , bans embryo research in Ireland . #% I have met with and been lobbied by many disability interest groups who asked for consideration of their position . #% This is the lives of our citizens . #% We need research and development in the Sixth Framework Programme . #% The derogations that some Member States have under excise duties for different tax treatment of high and low sulphur fuels , again , exhibit the power to influence behaviour through fiscal incentives . #% I say it is time we learnt the lesson and put some steel back into our stand against this hideous regime . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews . #% They have compromised the good names and reputations of those people in their own political family who were witnesses to , but not involved in , this murder . #% The vast majority of reports we have just voted upon I can support and agree with . #% We have all been moved by the pictures and stories coming from the media in recent days . #% The Commission needs to ensure legal security in information and communication technologies so as to protect consumers and innovative creators . #% The EU should therefore be part of a wider international campaign for good and high standards . #% If the House insists on maintaining the original date , President Santer will , instead , be at a European Council meeting . #% What many of us felt at the beginning would be a dossier which would not cause us much of a problem turned out to be an awful lot more tricky than we thought . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome the Taoiseach , Minister Roach and Ambassador Anderson this morning . #% We also welcome the Commission 's proposal to provide funding for fishermen affected by this decision . #% With all of those rights comes a responsibility . #% We have to investigate the operations of Finansbank , we have to investigate the operations of Gama , and we have to tell the Turkish authorities that companies incorporated in Turkey must comply with European law when they operate in the European Union . #% Madam President , we made arrangements that Irish would be interpreted . #% It means that we need to make sure that from the seed onwards there are checks and balances in the system . #% Per annum we are now paying as much as # 600 - # 700 million pounds into this fund . #% We are , therefore , in a new situation and it is misleading and incorrect to say there is no money to resolve it . #% The time has surely come for European governments to work together to try to solve this huge social , economic and political problem . #% In conclusion , I would urge the Commission to ensure that as quickly as possible we have a short-term resolution to the crisis for minor food-producing species in relation to the availability of state-of-art veterinary medicines . #% The objective of the Sharon Government at this point in time is the destruction of any possibility of a Palestinian State . #% Mr President , this House frequently and properly raises its voice in support of the victims of terrorism . #% This is a concern I have across all of our legislation and it is perhaps something that the Commissioner might address in the short time she has available to her . #% In the long run this will only be possible if each country has a full seat in the College of Commissioners . #% It is a matter for all democrats -- both in Spain and in Europe -- to back the Spanish Government in taking the process forward , because if we allow organisations like ETA or the IRA to see a gap between democrats as to how peace can be built , then we will fail and they will win . #% It is therefore of the utmost importance that Parliament delivers a favourable opinion this afternoon . #% We regret that the Commission is unable to recommend the amendments to the regulation which my group are putting forward . #% It is important that there is a balance between animal welfare and the need for consumer protection . #% in writing . - Mr Lehne has proposed an own-initiative report proposing a Council Regulation that aims to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) to facilitate cross-border transfers within the Community of the registered office of a company formed in a Member State of the Community . #% The justification for the aid , namely the necessity to undertake excessively expensive work , still exists . #% We have accepted great support from the European Union since we joined it and we are prepared to give back a great deal of what we received . #% I commend the establishment of the Pan-Irish Sea Alliance and wish them every success in delivering results to their vulnerable coastal communities . #% That is a terrible side to it which we do not refer to here . #% Secondly , the Council can further accept our suggested 55 months for the review of the recommendation . #% We need to know exactly what is going on . #% Custom and practice pending any Supreme Court decision in Denmark would suggest that the status quo should prevail . #% It was always going to take time to tease through what were very difficult , delicate and sensitive political matters . #% This is the EU that we will work towards . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , the most important thing we have to remember here today is the people 's lives that are affected by the new wave of violence in the Palestinian Territories . #% I should like to ask you , Sir , through your good offices , to see whether you could get it put on to the agenda , because this could be a very important sector for the creation of growth , both in employment and economic terms , and would actually stop jobs leaving the European Union . #% Would renationalisation mean any more fish ? #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response and would like to give him some information of which he may not be aware . #% With cancer rates across the world growing at this phenomenal rate , citizens are depending on governments for help , protection and information . #% I have to say that talking is no longer enough : it is action we need on global stocks and volatility in the market , and until you start to tackle that problem , you will not solve the problem . #% The protocol does not explain where and how fingerprinting will be done . #% 
As a member of the transport committee I believe it is the role of the European Parliament , as co-legislator , to do everything possible to have such a list quickly established . #% I would like to ask would he assure this Parliament that the establishment of a policy planning and early warning unit as envisaged under the Amsterdam Treaty will be given top priority ? #% Would the Council consider giving more support to foundations like the Clinton Foundation , which has proven to be so successful in individual countries ? #% Surely , in this House , we must recognise and value that principle of subsidiarity . #% We only have to look at the many problems we have facing our borders today - drugs , human trafficking , international crime and terrorism , to name but a few - to see the need for that . #% In essence , the MEDIA programme will help to develop the audiovisual sector in Europe during the coming six years . #% Much remains to be done , but very substantial progress has been made . #% But if you look at what the Commission is actually doing now , it seems that it is changing its approach to this . #% Mr President , I commence by complimenting the rapporteur , Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert , for her very practical and responsible approach to this important subject . #% I accept her point that there will probably have to be compromise on all sides but I would be interested to know when she anticipates conciliation starting . #% Already our competitors have demonstrated their negotiating skills in this crucial area of international policy . #% This is on a local pilgrimage path . #% I do not have a legal definition of all arrangements with the Union . #% I believe that the same risk exists today . #% The key to the future of a credible Europe lies in a proper relationship between the Commission and Parliament built on mutual respect . #% The Cologne , Helsinki and Lisbon Councils have all made significant contributions in that regard . #% Mr President , I am anxious to contribute to this debate to emphasise two main points . #% There is a key role for EUROPOL in the implementation of this report . #% This is an initiative of Sweden and Spain on ensuring that laboratory activities are accredited by the accreditation body in order to combat crime through closer cooperation between law enforcement authorities in the Member States . #% I want to thank my colleagues , the officials in committee and the officials in the Commission for their assistance in drawing up this report and I want to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on the presentation of her very comprehensive report . #% I speak for my own country of Ireland . #% Last year , amidst the final crescendo , publications such as were reporting that UNICEF 's failure to develop a coherent strategy for child survival and its shortcomings were contributing to 10 million child deaths per year . #% Commissioner Byrne seems to have taken offence at this and seen it as some kind of snub . #% When you look down through the list of issues and areas that need to be covered , of course there are always difficulties that will arise , whether it is with regard to long-term unemployment , youth unemployment , female unemployment , social welfare provision , protection with regard to access to housing , access to education and training , or more recently the demographic situation and the pensions crisis that is looming before us . #% Marine pollution , accidental and deliberate , is one of the major threats to the marine environment of Western Europe . #% During the ASEAN January meeting efforts were made by certain foreign ministers to keep human rights off the agenda . #% It seems to me , Commissioner , that in any event that you may end up in court if you do not comply . #% At a time when our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East , we have to rely on our inventiveness to earn our living . #% We will not accept second best any more . #% Yet where are we now ? #% Mr President , this resolution speaks of the gulf between the public and the European institutions . #% Let me say to Dr Paisley , when he talked about the votes he received , one vote for peace and reconciliation and an end of conflict is worth more than a thousand votes for a continuation of the conflict . #% I can not assure her that the Council of Ministers would agree . #% I finally accept that , for example , in relation to oil-soluble vitamins there is a case to be made in terms of safety . #% I recognise and agree with the need for rewards and incentives to industry which will encourage the development of paediatric medicinal products . #% In conclusion , I should like to say that satisfactory results in relation to this issue depend to a large extent on the use of safe and good quality feedingstuffs . #% We cover something like 120 budget lines with reference to ten different directorates-general . #% We have nothing else to replace DDT to eliminate malaria and the mosquito involved . #% However , as Alan Kelly has said , it is very important to ensure that any programmes or training courses that are put in place are tailor-made to respond to the needs of workers and that the possibility of re-entering the labour market , or setting up one 's own business , is the clear objective of any assistance . #% There are great hopes riding on the Ariane Programme , particularly in countries where minority languages are increasingly being used by our young writers and among the small publishers who have the courage to publish these books , knowing that they will probably make no money on them and , even worse , might possibly lose money on them . #% That is a precedent we have to be careful of . #% This is the framework in which we must move forward to conclude the agricultural negotiations with the candidate countries . #% Yes , there are still many bridges to cross , but today , in my opinion , we have crossed the Rubicon . #% A lot of people , certainly in my own country , are shocked that some of the money they have paid for buying a house has been used to corrupt the planning laws . #% Since the Amsterdam Treaty came into force on 1 May , the codecision procedure , which involves a very close relationship between Parliament , the Commission and the Council , now covers a wide range of policies including those in the transport sector , regional affairs , social matters , employment initiatives , structural funding , consumer protection , public health and environmental concerns . #% The reality is that the Commission representatives continue to refuse to make any analysis even in the face of the decision taken by the Transport Council last March to call for a study of the situation . #% The illegal drug trade is responsible for a great deal of misery in each of our countries and crime against people and property to fund drug habits means that large numbers of our citizens are living in constant fear for their personal safety . #% It is not worthy of being brought into this report either . #% Mr President , I asked to make this brief intervention following the observation of Mr Corbett . #% Patents that are registered or bought will control the very tools the programmer must use to exist as a programmer . #% It will help to strengthen new free-market economies of these countries , and it will contribute to making these countries more competitive . #% Our inflation rate is now lower than that in a number of other EU Member States . #% We need to ensure that indigenous energy sources can play a major role in energy supply . #% The provision of staging posts , therefore , is a central requirement . #% I do not have to remind the House of the relevance of sheep farming in areas not suited to other agricultural enterprises and the importance , from a rural development perspective , of sustaining farm families in those areas . #% Finally , acquisition and possession of child pornography with the aim of handing it over to the law enforcement authorities should be made an offence . #% Full implementation of Resolution 1284 obliges Iraq , among other things , to cooperate with the Red Cross in overseeing the repatriation of detainees . #% As the rapporteur has said , they must comply without further delay and the Commission must monitor the situation and impose severe penalties where the rules are not fully implemented . #% To guarantee the allocation for the peace process in Northern Ireland , the Council must now facilitate this accumulation of reserves between the first and second readings . #% Mr President , I should like to thank both the Commissioner , for an excellent Green Paper , and Mr Bowis for his report , which has added even more to what was an excellent standing start . #% On the one hand , we are warning of the disappearance of oil and promoting alternatives ; on the other hand , sugar -- one of the viable alternatives -- has been made to disappear . #% I would ask the Members of this House to consider the case of the northern cod stock off Newfoundland which provided 200 000 tonnes of fish every year for five centuries . #% There is plenty of time : we have years to go in relation to this . #% On the issue of Taiwan , I also condemn President Jiang Zemin 's threats to use military force . #% in writing . - The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement has a mandate which is vital for the protection of Intellectual Property Rights . #% Could the Commissioner confirm that it is her intention that whatever regulation is needed will pass into law by summer of next year ? #% 
Much of the debate here yesterday focused on the Irish people 's decision in relation to the Nice Treaty . #% There is considerable international ignorance about family law and what happens in the event of marital breakdown and children being taken back to a country where they do not normally live . #% The EU at all levels is a partnership with the national governments . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% We believe that we have a fair and just deal for Member States . #% Madam President , when we discussed this last week in the Conference of Presidents , my group - the Liberal Democrats - voted to have a debate today and not to postpone it . #% Having gone through the trauma of the allocation of fish quotas , there is a greater awareness throughout the European Union of the scarcity of this most important resource . #% Large-scale commercial enterprises should not be allowed to usurp funding which should go , in my view , go to family farming . #% Working time will still be calculated over a 4 month period , with exemptions available to calculate over 12-months -- subject to stronger control through collective bargaining . #% I think the poor rural masses and the urban working class in Thailand urgently need their own independent organisation to fight for their rights , and I hope that the next mobilisation in Thailand might be a united struggle of workers , poor farmers , students and youth , dedicated to overthrowing all corrupt elites and bringing the major wealth of Thailand into public ownership and democratic control and , in a socialist Thailand , transforming the lives of its people and also fighting for the rights of all minorities . #% As well as that , there are still no arrangements to ensure the safe delivery of her unborn child . #% A clinical clean-up operation -- which took some time , I might add -- was then ordered by local IRA leaders . #% I need hardly say that I am totally against smoking as an ageing ex-nurse . #% Despite the prevalence of this work in all Member States , statistical evaluations of ` labour forces ' rarely take this into account , leaving it under-analysed , ill appreciated and unrecognised . #% Iraqi and Kurdish authorities should provide the monitors with full access and cooperation to protect the Iraqi population , including the Kurdish population of northern Iraq , now potentially at risk of attack from Turkey . #% I would remind the Commission that the Maastricht Treaty was very nearly derailed , largely because the general public in many of our Member States did not feel sufficiently involved in the debate leading up to Maastricht . #% This can only be achieved if agreement can be reached by member countries of the World Trade Organisation . #% It is up to the people to determine what the level of debate and discussion and the final verdict on this Constitutional Treaty will be . #% The report which we are dealing with today relates to the setting-up of a new Erasmus World initiative which is due to come into operation in the year 2004 . #% All vehicles within the European Union must now be fully recyclable by the year 2015 . #% I want to thank all Members who signed it , even if at times they felt overwhelmed by our enthusiasm and over-zealous attempts at persuasion . #% Madam President , unfortunately I was chairing my group meeting when my question came up . #% These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field : food must be of the same standard in all Member States . #% I am not in a position to comment on the last proposal put forward by the honourable Member , but may I say that the Council of Ministers has been preoccupied not with expelling or allowing countries to leave the Union but with the 12 countries which are knocking on the door wishing to join , so attractive does the Union seem to them . #% I do not think it is reasonable to inform the people of Europe that there was a loss of EUR 14 million to the European budget arising out of this case . #% Whether or not nuclear power stations are taken out of operation at the planned date or earlier is entirely a matter for the Member State concerned . #% Some months ago I asked the Commission to undertake a pilot initiative on this . #% The formulation of a long-term objective of food security must be strategically based , with specific targeting of aid . #% I welcome this first step in the process of expanding the Union into central and eastern Europe and I look forward to the opening of the negotiations with the rest of the countries who have applied for membership . #% Secondly , I would like to thank the EU Commission personnel involved in election observation . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for his reply , and even though he said it would take him longer to put all the measures together , I am still encouraged by his response . #% We must also assist in promoting marketing structures to cooperatives to enable small enterprises to compete and successfully market their products . #% the promotion of cooperation between security and intelligence services and police , judicial and customs authorities of the Member States and third countries , raising the issue of data protection and constituting a deterioration of civil liberties and respect for human rights ; #% The problem to date has been , in my experience in Northern Ireland , that the consumer has borne the brunt of the cost of the extra traceability , and this has been substantial . #% Member States have an explicit right to put stringent public health rules in place , including a total exclusion of cloned human material or human animal hybrids , as transplantable material . #% The costs of a cleaner environment and water supply are difficult to quantify , however . #% We are allocating at least 1 % of GDP annually to build up the pension reserve fund so as to provide for our ageing population . #% What the UK is doing in relation not only to the UK coast but also in relation to the EU as a whole is completely unacceptable . #% When Members States vote 10 to 5 against anti-dumping procedures , which they believe will not be in the interest of the industry , then you and the Commission must accept those decisions . #% Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Mulder for his report and all the work he has done on it . #% It is a good and useful thing that we can talk , because I do now accept the need for Article 186 to be brought into place so that we can get this money direct to the producers as fast as we possibly can . #% This is my valedictory speech , Mr President . #% It now seems increasingly likely that a significant number of the Member States will opt to establish the single currency in three years time . #% One should recall that the Council had originally proposed an exemption for a period of some 13 years before doctors in training would secure the benefits of the directive . #% However , let me sound a note of caution in relation to the efforts inherent in this Commission proposal to base this measure on Article 95 of the Treaty . #% On the de Brémond d'Ars report , we voted against that report because it is , in effect , going to hinder completely the possibility of liberalizing the postal service , which is not in the interests of the consumer and not in the interests of the internal market . #% After all , the European Parliament has the final say in whether an applicant country joins or not . #% Reducing European farmers ' capacity and hampering their competitiveness and viability with a weak CAP budget would be counterproductive and short-sighted . #% Inevitably each Prime Minister puts his own spin on what summits achieve . #% On top of that , there is the fact that Mr Barroso came to us as the directly elected representatives of the people of Europe to put his case in each of our groups . #% If we want the internal market to work we need flanking measures to promote consumer confidence , particularly in cross-border shopping , and we know that in online shopping consumers still have a tendency to buy in their own home market . #% We took a risk at the last enlargement by admitting three new members before any significant institutional reforms were in place to deal with the consequences of expanded membership . #% The Prestige incident should have been viewed as occurring in EU waters , with potentially devastating consequences for the shared environment and European fishing industries . #% I appeal in particular to the Group of the Party of European Socialists to try to give us a way out on this , because we want to support the overall thrust of the García Arias recommendations . #% This report calls for greater transparency which I am sure the majority of MEPs will support #% In the end it was after 7:00 p.m. before Question Time started . #% I should also like to inform you that in the Member States , particularly in the UK , questions are being raised concerning your support for reprocessing in some of your statements . #% in writing . - It is very important that the rules of economic governance are reinforced , especially in light of the economic crisis that many EU countries are still going through . #% Too often when we bring in special laws and new laws in response to these kinds of emergencies or situations , they stay on our books after the emergency has passed and can be utilised again and again . #% Will it bring it to the attention of the French presidency ? #% I am sorry if the Member thought I was introducing a red herring . #% Mr Marset Campos does that . #% That is the most despicable form of political discourse or activity that I have ever come across . #% I welcome efforts this week to finalise an EU-wide arrest warrant to deal with these criminal ` people smugglers ' who benefit financially from the misery and desperation of others . #% While politicians must lead , that leadership must be accompanied by the involvement of citizens and the promotion of civil society . #% Mr Haarder , on behalf of his colleagues in Council , did not tell us on what Council 's judgement was based . #% 
It is incumbent on this House to make clear to the Commission and the Council that aid needs to be provided to the European airline industry and to the aviation industry in general , so that we can maintain a European aviation industry , particularly our airlines . #% While much more remains to be done in the field , this is an important step towards better regulation of the activities of alternative investment fund managers , which was met with opposition even after the 2008 financial crisis hit hard , most notably by Charlie McCreevy , the Internal Market commissioner in charge at the time . #% Mr President , for 16 years now the family of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane has campaigned for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his murder . #% For that reason there is not very much left to say . #% Last year I produced a detailed policy proposal calling for the establishment of an EU coastguard , which I submitted to the European Convention for discussion . #% Given the experience that many citizens have had purchasing overseas property , an online register reflecting all relevant charges affecting property ownership rights is vital . #% There is still # 2m outstanding to Irish road hauliers resulting from this strike which must be paid by the French Government immediately . #% It played second fiddle to the rush to get agreement on the Euro . #% Lack of clean water , lack of sanitation , lack of essential drugs , the cost of essential drugs , drug resistance issues , ineffective pesticides and drugs , drug toxicity , but above all , the main cause is the lack of political will in the developed world to do something about it . #% Without any doubt , this leaves domestic workers in a precarious position , and very often they have to rely on the goodwill of employers . #% I am pleased at the progress which was made in building dialogue at the sixth India-EU summit last year . #% Even our colleague Mr Cunha 's proposal for decoupling male beef but not sucklers in my country , Ireland , must come with a health warning , as it will collapse the price of calves and weanlings . #% Mr President , on this point I do not mind what we do . #% Any suspension of aid must be decided by the Council of Ministers by qualified majority after the European Parliament , but we must ensure that any financial aid and debt relief is organised in such a way as to ensure that some corrupt African leaders , without mentioning names , can not rearm themselves to bolster highly questionable regimes . #% So for those who do not want that to happen , ironically , they should support Article 175 tomorrow so that we go into conciliation and politically we decide the shape , which will not be purely Article 175 because there will have to be compromises . #% In particular , I want to thank Mrs Anttila for her report on the transport of animals . #% Worker consultation and information is a key part of the former but relatively unknown in the latter . #% This is the root of the political problem which now faces us . #% I ask you to support my amendments to extend the exclusive coastal fishing zone to 24 miles . #% Otherwise we may as well hand over the monopoly of food production to large multinational corporations , which would be a very anti-social development indeed . #% It is recognition by all the key EU institutions of the political importance of assisting farmers , their families and the rural communities in which they live . #% Will the Commission take further action on the likely developments ? #% The industry comprises more than 21 000 firms providing 530 000 jobs , with a turnover in excess of EUR 72 billion . #% There are those who have said to me that this still does not go far enough , but I think we have the best consensus available to us at this moment in time . #% I can not say whether the advent of the single market has contributed to lack of control in these particular areas , but I can say that , with the benefit of hindsight , we need to look at how we can strengthen controls in this particular area . #% I acknowledge the courage shown by those who are signatories to this agreement and the role that the Norwegian Government and its Ambassador to Sri Lanka played in bringing it about . #% And we recently had great difficulty reaching a decision on that . #% Unless practical and feasible changes are made to the control system , fisheries policy will not have the confidence of fishermen and will certainly fail . #% Is that what the Commission is demanding or is the Irish government playing its own privatisation game under cover of the present crisis ? #% Given the importance of conservation this report falls very far short of what is really required . #% They are particularly concerned that the traditional , consensual , decision-making process of the EU is being abandoned in favour of a system whereby larger Member States will exercise power at the expense of smaller countries . #% While only around 10 % of the world ' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa , 70 % of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there . #% They pass through seven boroughs , including West Hampstead , Islington , Hackney , Hammersmith , Fulham , Wandsworth and Bromley . #% There seems to be some misunderstanding . #% I wish to address the issue of the technicalities . #% The change of legal basis from one relying on QMV -- Article 95 -- to one providing for unanimous voting by the Council -- Articles 93 and 94 of the Treaty -- is very much in line with precedent and , fortunately , with my own government 's position on tax legislation . #% I support him entirely in his approach and I thank him for it . #% It is probably true to say that every single Member of this House has had some experience of the kinds of problems faced by ordinary passengers and it is good that we are now dealing with this issue . #% It is still the institution that controls the operations of competition policy , the common agricultural policy , the common fisheries policy and the common transport policy . #% Can the Commissioner please state what follow-up action has been taken ? #% Therefore , I hope that the Council will take further action to ensure that this does not continue and also to seek out where other convictions of a similar nature have taken place . #% in writing . - MEPs have received more than 400 petitions concerning widespread misleading business practices by business directory companies affecting thousands of mostly small businesses . #% Most of the public sentiment surrounding the whole question of driftnet fishing comes from experiences in the Pacific , where everything is entirely different , where the tuna fish swim close to dolphins and where driftnets do cause a loss of other sea life besides what they are intended to catch . #% This is exceptionally important if the Union is to remain competitive in the years to come . #% That is essential . #% We in Parliament will say ` yes ' to new taxes but ` no ' to more taxes . #% It says that the European Union , together with the Western European Union will jointly consider future requirements in strengthening mutual cooperation within one year following the entry into force of that Treaty , in order to give the WEU , ' as an integral part of the development of the Union ' , an organizational framework . #% It is both welcome and reassuring that from the very outset the new Commissioner , Mr Byrne , has demonstrated an unequivocal commitment to restoring consumer confidence in the food industry . #% It is compounded by questions of transparency and whether the proposals are not already obsolete . #% You will know that in the case of the UK , at a moderation seminar , the Commission agreed a timetable to allow for review and inclusion of additional sites . #% We should be looking for materials and substances for children 's toys where there is no doubt about safety whatsoever . #% Mr President , Mr Churchill , who I think was a Conservative , indicated on more than one occasion that he thought the democratic system was not great , but it was the best that we had and we had to defend it and protect it and , indeed , we have to regulate it . #% The fact that Europe outstripped the United States in growth terms for half a century up to the mid-1990s , by developing and putting into place a remarkable social infrastructure which ensured that prosperity could be shared , was a remarkable achievement . #% We need to know what it was that made the fatal difference . #% Parliament 's amendments to the Council of Ministers ' common position encompass the budget - we insisted on an increase to EUR 200 million with a review clause - and numerous clarifications . #% I want to emphasise variable rate mortgages . #% Consumers will only participate in sorting and recovery schemes if they are simple to manage and if good collection of separated waste bags is available . #% In addition to the fine balance attained , I am very satisfied to see the increased assistance for SMEs , the promotion of alternatives to animal testing , community-wide labelling , and creation of an EU agency to manage the technical , scientific and administrative aspects of the REACH system at Community level . #% We would agree with the Commission that fleets are too large and must be reduced . #% Mr President , one wonders what one can say in two minutes on the appointment of a Commission . #% The whole country and I am sure the whole of Europe would appreciate it if you would communicate to the Irish media and , in particular , the editor of the Irish Independent newspaper in Dublin , our deep sympathy and our continuing support for freedom of speech and guaranteeing the protection of democracy . #% The Commission , while allowing this to happen , adopts an entirely different attitude to the pig producers of Northern Ireland . #% The market in weapons is now so competitive that some of the most horrific despots are getting bargain basement deals for weapons of mass destruction . #% I voted against Amendment 28 in order to secure the reference to national law on family or family status , including reproductive rights . #% During an economic crisis , there are increased risks of poverty and social exclusion for many citizens , but particularly for those on the margins of society , for those who become unemployed and for those who rely on the various social safety nets that operate within the different Member States . #% We now have the ludicrous requirement that a DIY retailer , for example , who buys in packaged goods and sells them on , is required to make returns detailing the net weight of the packaging of all such goods passing through his business , even though he never opens or discards any of the packaging . #% 
However , the studies which have been carried out - and referred to here - on public health and , in particular , the health of children and babies , show that there is an urgent need to take action to resolve this problem . #% The average citizen must be aware of what work is being carried on when we get near to the frontiers of what is acceptable and in some cases beyond those frontiers . #% Multilateral systems have a greater success and lay claim to greater legitimacy in upholding respect for the rule of law in relations between states . #% We are playing uphill on a very sloping playing field against the United States . #% . Mr President , I welcome Mr Mavrommatis 's report and , indeed , I welcome the European Ombudsman here today to the European Parliament . #% When these countries join the European Union they will bring a new impetus , a new ideology , and a new belief in the vision the founding fathers of the European Union had of a Europe of peace , prosperity , progress and respect for Europe 's diversity . #% It is important that something happens as a result of this recommendation , that there is some sort of legal framework . #% Is it not about time we became masters of our own policy , our own approach , our own attitude in foreign affairs ? #% Mr President , Commissioner , it is a sad fact , but we must face up to the reality that there are far too many drivers on our roads without sufficient insurance . #% We lay great emphasis on SMEs , as you will see , and I look forward to some sort of rational discussion with the Council about its motivation for making cuts which appear to contradict every policy of the European Union . #% I quote from OECD : ' Monetary policy will have to be used to avoid this short-run risk . #% That is really unfortunate and a gross abdication of our duty to people all over the world . #% I understand that there may be some problems concerning ratification by some Member States . #% There is quite a lot of hypocrisy concerning this issue , and I would like to refer to my own Minister for Justice in Ireland , John O'Donoghue . #% For the European Union to succeed , there must be broad economic coordination from the 25 Member States . #% In March , the Guardian newspaper wrote that Miss McAliskey 's case illustrated how prisoners awaiting extradition or deportation hearings could find themselves treated worse than those who had been convicted . #% I support him completely , particularly in relation to option 2 , and I welcome the Commissioner 's comments this evening . #% For years you , Commissioner McCreevy , as Irish Minister for Finance , refused to amend the Tote Act and outlaw child betting in Ireland . #% A 2007 European survey indicates that the majority of EU citizens feel that public authorities have not done an adequate job of informing them on ways to protect themselves from EMFs . #% In addition , institutional prices for sugar have declined continuously since 1985 by 36 % in real terms . #% I should like to end with a good news story , a dramatic example of a fiscal incentive to prevent , minimise , reuse and recycle and an example of how each Member State can determine its own mix of prevention , reuse and recycling to meet targets . #% But the United Kingdom and Ireland have stayed out . #% The onus is on the Commission to ensure that Member States comply with the rules . #% Most ominously , the lives of Father Cullen , his assistant and legal adviser have been threatened . #% I would also like to congratulate my colleague , Mr Mussa , for his work on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy in tackling issues which were not fully addressed in the Commission proposal , in particular training for health professionals , nurses and those involved in specific expert care for the elderly . #% While the government in Spain is seeking to end ETA bloodshed through dialogue and negotiation , it is incumbent on all democratic parties , both inside and outside Spain , to offer support to the process . #% It is not acceptable that at one and the same time as we improve the quality of life internally within the European Union that some EU firms are breaching health and safety rules or exploiting labour and are causing serious and permanent damage to the environment in developing countries . #% Our powers in this regard are limited but this does not mean that we can not speak on these matters and try and make improvements . #% Mr President , I really think this is much ado about very little . #% But I have to ask a supplementary question . #% People need to realise that globalisation is here , and it is here to stay . #% We have an important job to do to explain the workings of the whole productive system to the consumers of Europe and those outside the Union who will buy our food . #% in writing . - My colleague , Mr Harbour , has presented an own-initiative report regarding increasing innovation in Europe to ensure sustainable and high-quality public services . #% For that I warmly congratulate you . #% No-one is highjacking the work of the committee . #% There seems quite a lot of evidence to back up these allegations . #% This is why we need an active cohesion policy orientated towards employment and growth . #% That is the language of the agreement we made with the Commission and the Member States . #% If we are serious about this , we must be prepared to make funds available for research and development in this area , both at national and European levels . #% If there is , we have generated it in this House in the past year . #% Mr President , when I met the new Chief Executive of Hong Kong , Tung Chee-hwa , earlier this week , I raised a number of concerns relating to recent developments there which do not augur well for the protection of human rights . #% However , this has to be a relationship based on equality and mutual respect . #% Small and mediumsized enterprises must be able to reap the benefits from the new climate created by the single currency in the immediate future and they must be helped to do so by national governments and state agencies . #% With regard to the effects of radiation on human beings , here we have an important breakthrough due to the work of Dr Mothersill in Ireland and the UK Medical Research Council team of Dr Eric Wright on genomic instability . #% Too often we have seen hidden barriers put in place to prevent people from one profession or another moving to a country to operate . #% Since that is not going to be a reality and already is not a reality , we have to give some thought to how we treat those minority languages which are not used in the everyday business of the Union . #% It is also a fact that Sinn Fein 's influence within communities in Northern Ireland can bring about justice in this case . #% I believe there is an important principle here in relation to access to information . #% I want it to be clarified that GMOs will never be allowed to contaminate an organic farm . #% The use of medicated feed for prophylactic or growth-promotion reasons can not continue to feature in management , as is the case in some feeding systems and in some Member States at present . #% This presidency was characterised by enthusiasm and diplomacy . #% We do not want to build a two-tier Europe , or a Europe of the haves and have nots . #% While the energy mix must continue to remain a Member State competence , in a single market , an attack on one is an attack on all in energy terms . #% I urge the President-in-Office of the Council to utilise what are obviously the good offices of the Spanish presidency to bring about that solution . #% First of all , I would like to say that this is not anti-communism . #% Since then the European beef industry has been brought to its knees . #% My group 's essential and fundamental starting point in this debate is very clear . #% I congratulate the Commission on behalf of the Liberal Group for claiming ownership on behalf of all the Union of the stability pact concept and I believe that their proposal exhibits a careful and appropriate balance . #% Temperature increases can trigger serious consequences , with coastal areas flooded and the lives of many people living in island communities under threat . #% This Parliament has matured in recent months and we have learned one basic lesson for the years ahead : we are no longer the junior partner in the European political institutions . #% To interfere with this for political reasons would be an appalling start to this major irreversible strategic project . #% Therefore it is clearly not an easy problem to get to grips with . #% I thank the Member for his comments and , just in case there is any mistake , I will also check the matter . #% This is necessary for the long-term survival of the European railway sector and all Member States would be in agreement with this goal . #% Commissioner , I hope you will take up the issues in the committee 's question . #% 100,000 people expressed their anger and made it clear they will not accept a European Union based on the lowest common denominator in social , employment , and public service provisions . #% 
Mr President , firstly I should just like to make a technical point . #% I understand there is plenty of information that some supermarket chains in the UK have publicly declared that they have excluded Irish beef from their shelves for the moment . #% In committee , a disgraceful amendment was tabled in an attempt to establish a link between what was called Christian fundamentalism and neo-Nazi groups . #% There is agreement to implement the framework directive permitting the freezing of criminal assets within the Union . #% Clearly the current EU and indeed US markets could do with an output boost , but it is the developing countries which would really have benefited from a successful Cancún . #% I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process . #% However , I have in my possession a study carried out by University College , Dublin , which highlights the negative impact of this proposed extension of the directive , not only on the grounds of safety and competitiveness , but also on the grounds of damage to the environment . #% In my country , where we have less than four million inhabitants , there are 2.5 million members of credit unions with savings in excess of EUR 9 billion . #% The Spanish Presidency is now dealing with the most difficult enlargement negotiations , notably agriculture , the structural funds and budgetary matters . #% I should like to ask this House to lend its support to my colleague John Hume in trying to find out the truth so that justice will prevail . #% However , I also believe that this was a provocative act by ` Women on Waves ' and an attempt to undermine the principle of subsidiarity because , while in this House we may or may not agree with Portugal 's stance on abortion , we must at all times recognise its right as a democratically elected government to make these decisions . #% In effect , I feel an EU logo would be meaningless , a waste of time and money and I feel the same way about the EU logo for organic produce . #% I completely concur with what you have just said , President-in-Office . #% They are showing contempt for the wish and will of the international community as regards the right of people to live in peace , the right of people not to be oppressed , the right of people not to be killed with weapons made by western countries . #% I should like to come back to Objective 5 ( a ) and particularly budget line 886 . #% There is no surer way to bring about the downfall and disintegration of this Union than to make laws that Member States do not ensure are then observed . #% BSE has unfortunately been with us for some considerable time and I suspect that we have to recognise that it will probably be with us for some years ahead . #% For far too long the EU has sent its distant water fishing vessels to scour the oceans off Africa and other areas where they can cause immense harm to fish stocks and to local artisanal fishing communities . #% Finally , the European Parliament has extensive powers of codecision to deal with environmental and public health issues . #% However , greater focus should be placed on solar , wind and water energy , as this can also contribute a great deal towards a final energy plan . #% As a member of the Development and Cooperation Committee of the European Parliament , I recognise that AIDS is rampant , particularly on the continent of Africa . #% Is it any coincidence that this protocol was attached during the Spanish presidency and forced through ? #% I should like Commissioner Leon Brittan , when he sums up , to tell us whether he will undertake , on our behalf and on behalf of the Commission , to follow up the three points made to the Commission in the conclusions in my opinion and also in Mr Porto 's report . #% It is outrageous that no warning signals were sounded while Parmalat funds were being embezzled . #% There was the recent case of the Israeli Prime Minister being threatened with legal action . #% It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families . #% They can see it coming in the future . #% Will the change in co-financing from 75 % to 50 % apply equally to EAGGF projects and those under ESF and ERDF ? #% I would therefore call on the British Government in this debate to avail itself forthwith of the opportunities available under these regulations . #% I would ask people to bear in mind that citizenship is not defined by the passport you hold . #% We welcome the emphasis on looking for European added value , not scattering the limited funds over the whole range of research carried out . #% There are a lot of good ideas in this report . #% Far from not wanting new ways at European or Member Statelevel of approaching this problem , I am one of the most ardent supporters of new approaches and I am the Minister responsible - as it happens , at the Prime Minister 's office - for local development in my own country . #% I have already outlined at great length the moves which the Council is taking in this regard . #% I come from the country where this experiment took place . #% While the report is welcome , certain areas remain unclear ; for example , whether existing wilderness areas or potential future wilderness areas are being discussed . #% Mr President , in one minute you can say very little but I concur with what Mr van Orden , Mrs Kinnock and many of the other speakers have said . #% It is estimated that a low rate FTT could yield nearly EUR 200 billion per year at EU level and USD 650 billion at global level , constituting a substantial contribution by the financial sector to the cost of the crisis and to public finance sustainability . #% I support the extension of the mandate of Europol to investigate money laundering matters . #% Europe should lead the world by levying this tax within its borders and campaigning for it to be introduced in the rest of the world . #% Look at our next big spending : regional policy . #% I will check that but can I ask ( and I do not expect you to give a formal answer ) whether - maybe when it does come before the Council - the Luxembourg Government will support such a proposal and whether maybe it is something , as you go out of your presidency , that you will pressurize the next presidency about ? #% This report states that support for renewable energy projects must not be viewed as a straightforward subsidy under the state aid rules . #% An emissions trading scheme and auctioning rights are worth investigating , but , I ask the Commissioner , would a stand-alone or closed ETS for aviation not fall at the first hurdle , since all the trading entities would be net buyers and there would be no market ? #% Already I understand four states , Ireland , Denmark , Sweden and Netherlands have given such an indication . #% The misleading business practices in question typically consist in luring businesses , as well as professionals and non-profit entities , into being listed in a business directory free of charge only for the signatories to later discover that they have signed a contract with a fee . #% However , I have to say that in committee we had 275 amendments to this report and we managed to bring it through with virtually no amendments . #% Let us not be caught in this position again . #% I met with ambassadors in Tel Aviv , moved on to Jerusalem to meet Israeli peace groups and then on to Jenin to talk to the residents there . #% It is not uncommon for birthday , Christmas and first communion money to wind up in the Irish state tote and , ultimately , with the Irish Exchequer . #% The Irish delegation will vote for President Prodi and the Commission . #% However , I fully support the resolution , as does the PPE-DE Group , with perhaps a couple of caveats . #% In 1997 Ireland for example received over IEP 1.4 million from the European Union for the administration of the school milk programme . #% However , we must also learn from the mistakes of the past . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner - assuming that he can verify that - if he has the power to prosecute the people in question for this declared and confessed discrimination . #% The new President-in-Office of the Council has said that he would not tolerate having any members of the IRA/Sinn Fein in the Dublin Government , but insists that we tolerate them if we are to have a government in Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom . #% Mr Garot succeeds in his report in focusing our minds on the basics of the common agricultural policy and what it is all about . #% I am anxious about the potential damage to the Irish ecosystem with potentially dangerous effects on Irish agriculture and our tourism sector . #% Mr President , common sense seems to have abandoned the PPE-DE Group and the Liberals on this issue . #% I support the legislation , but before welcoming the compromise package agreed between the representatives of the European Parliament and the Council , which goes further by extending the ban of concentration in toys and childcare articles to children in general -- as opposed to the original wording referring to children under three years of age -- we must first obtain clarification as to the exact nature of the risk posed by DINP , DIDP and DNOP to children . #% author . - Mr President , I am not the author of the question but the Chairperson of the committee that is taking the question forward on behalf of Members . #% Principle number three creates the circumstances in which they can then all work together in their common interests and break down the barriers of the past . #% But let us start somewhere ! #% Who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first started that the numbers of people in employment in the European Union in the information technology sector would be as high as they are today ? #% The German Society of Human Genetics , through its chair , states : ' We are opposed to the patenting of the human genome and the DNA sequences it contains . #% More land will become available for alternative use as a result of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy . #% 
Alongside ALTENER , and the research into renewable energy in the 5th Framework Programme , which we hope will be very significant , we need urgent flanking measures such as the `` feed-in directive '' for the electricity market . #% The rich could dig in behind their barriers , they could buy some essential things from the poorer countries but we would be back to the seventeenth century with the strong exploiting the weak . #% There is a legitimate market in mainland Europe for young cattle from Irish farms . #% I hope that the Irish referendum will not get in the way of this process . #% At this stage in the procedure it will be up to us , the Members , to ensure that the participating nations get the best possible deal to ensure that they can continue and , in some cases complete , the ongoing good work in the environment and transport infrastructure . #% I do not want to be alarmist in any way but the fact that the British Government has already acted is something which should be taken into consideration . #% New TENs projects are needed to address existing and future bottlenecks , along with a sufficient infrastructure charging policy . #% Given the situation , are n't we lucky to have Mr Diamandouros ! #% On the great white shark issue , the Community has generally supported the Appendix II listing , but rejected the zero quota on legal and scientific grounds . #% But that is essential if we are going to provide any kind of proper spatial development to ensure that the population does not drift entirely to the eastern coast . #% However , if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva , then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources . #% I would ask the President-in-Office whether she would take into consideration the initiative taken by both Ireland and the UK in relation to technical conservation measures and see that some effort is made by all countries to try to ensure that the smaller fish are not taken on board . #% In Ireland VRT totals EUR 1.15 billion , which is a huge amount in a very small country . #% In recent times the mask has slipped and parties who advocate peaceful means have used inflammatory language , which exacerbates rather than calms the situation . #% I would press the Commissioner to send one of his officials to Northern Ireland immediately to assess for himself the tragedy and gravity of the situation . #% It is therefore very worrying that the beekeeping sector continues to report that the mortality rates are astonishingly high . #% We can learn some things from the experience we have already gained . #% Second , while enhancing the effectiveness of the fight against cross-border crime , I am concerned at a proposal to extend qualified majority voting to issues relating to criminal law . #% The recovery issue and the judgment of the European Court of Justice really do not impact on Ireland as we have no recovery or incineration facilities at the moment and will not have for some time to come . #% Firstly , I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated . #% I certainly agree with some of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur , including the need for setting a deadline of seven working days for the supplier to return monies that have been received from the consumer . #% The Chinese authorities have successfully persuaded companies such as Yahoo and Google to allow filtering of their search engines . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Kellett-Bowman for his excellent report . #% For instance , regional tuna management bodies such as ICAT have made great progress in combating fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience . #% I spoke earlier about the great success of rural development in the town of Tullamore but , in case you think all is wonderful in rural Ireland , in terms of broadband penetration , we are unfortunately languishing in 17th place in the European Union . #% Is that the kind of future we want for our own coastal communities ? #% The United States ' concern for the starving populations of the world is as genuine as George Bush 's concern for the Iraqi people 's rights . #% Nobody in Parliament today has condoned or justified the terrible act , but all have called for justice . #% Parliament , therefore , can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn . #% I would refer Members in particular to Amendment No 22 dealing with Article 12 ( 1 ) which provides that there will not be universal charges for water where special social and other conditions apply . #% It is also heartening to note that no fraud was found in connection with the projects which were financed and this is an example to follow in other areas . #% We will not truly have a single market in the area of passenger cars and road vehicles until we all start driving on the same side of the road so that we can all have either left-hand or right-hand drive cars . #% I would genuinely like to know what would be the effect on the public procurement market if thresholds were to be increased , and particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises and on consumers . #% As we look to the future , we must also remember ` the past ' , the ideals of the founders of the European Economic Community . #% They must be as good as their word and ensure that those empty Annexes are filled . #% This is not the case from my experience . #% Would the Commissioner agree that at this time , when migration throughout the European Union is increasing , implementation of the posting of workers directive is crucial in order to ensure that there is no race to the bottom and that migrant workers are not exploited by unscrupulous employers ? #% I await the bringing forward of specific programmes and measures in which stakeholders in the tourist industry can participate . #% Mr President , I can not speak about the transportation of nuclear waste without speaking about Sellafield , which Mr Chichester has mentioned . #% With such a dreaded virus one is somewhat reluctant to talk about success , other than to say thankfully Ireland 's quick response , sometimes regarded as extreme , has so far been successful in containing the disease to one outbreak . #% I voted against this . #% The European Union 's efforts to support this minority language are immensely appreciated . #% The main focus of this report relates to supporting greater cooperation between the fifteen Member States of the European Union to combat social exclusion . #% Whatever the cost , it is not in the interests of the European Union that the family farms which are central to the European agricultural model are fast becoming marginalised . #% That is what has to be addressed . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Madam President , world capitalism is experiencing its worst crisis since the Great Depression . #% They were disappointed in the British Government and bitterly disappointed at the way the months of ceasefire were squandered and the opportunity to establish a greater dialogue was lost . #% Finally , I want to acknowledge the role of Parliament in approving the fund for Dell workers . #% In other words , were Member States ' regulators in other countries informed as soon as possible ? #% Ireland is an island and we export over 90 % of our total production . #% We in Ireland are exporting jobs as well . #% In short , the Greens consider that a rigorous programme of fleet reduction accompanied by compensation for the fishermen thus affected is a fundamental prerequisite for resolving the current crisis . #% That is something we must guard against . #% It has been estimated that some 20 000 paedophiles in Europe use the Internet daily . #% Open trade - yes , but only with rules . #% Until we can clarify this confusion and incorporate the International Civil Aviation Organization 's guidelines and requirements properly , would the Council not seek to ban the transport of this material over the territories of the Member States and require organizations , such as British Nuclear Fuels Ltd , to refrain from issuing assertions that it has been officially designated as low-dispersal material , because this is not helpful and , indeed , extremely misleading in this context ? #% I believe that if they are going to be full members of this Union within a number of years then they have a right to participate in debating what kind of Europe we are going to have . #% The G7 criteria for doing so is leastcost and safety conscious and it has now been proven by official studies that this is not the least-cost or the safest option . #% It is unfortunate that it took a considerable time to get the stretcher to take Mr Staes out of the Chamber . #% The scandalous treatment of Dinesh Sakaria in Sweden , the spectacle made of the British plane-spotters in Greece , and the appalling conviction of Kevin Sweeney in the Netherlands convinces UK citizens that they are best served by maintaining the procedures and bulwarks of their common-law-based system rather than ever being tempted to trade it in for the flawed continental model . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Commissioner , and commiserate with her for her illness . #% Around half of the people who become infected with HIV do so before they are 25 and are killed by AIDS before they are 35 . #% We must build up our resilience to the effects of climate change . #% Mr President , I believe that the European Parliament should give its assent to the European Energy Charter which was underwritten in The Hague in December 1991 . #% Often there are no sports fields or crèches and few shops . #% Contrary to IMO conventions , the company refused to allow trade union representatives to visit the crew on board . #% 
I would also like to make a request on the record now , so the message gets through , that we will be calling on the Austrian Presidency to comment tomorrow on this specifically . #% A financial transaction tax could deal with two problems at once - how to finance ever-growing demands to put new EU policies in place , and how to make the financial sector contribute to the resolution of the economic crisis that it helped to cause . #% in writing . - I was pleased to support this proposal and would like to express my country 's appreciation for the solidarity funding allocated to our country as a result of November 2009 flooding . #% I deplore the fact that the resolution does not reflect the concerns of our citizens at the unlawful killing of Iraqis by the occupation forces . #% I should like to ask you to put the ratification of Kyoto , which is essential for progress and for all our futures , way up there at the top of the agenda at the EU-Russia summit . #% Travel for Members of this House is difficult enough without bringing in new agencies , without consulting Members . #% In expressing our displeasure , we have to be careful not to punish any further the suffering people of Belarus . #% Mr President , I very much agree with the last speaker . #% More needs to be done , but a lot has been done and we must recognise that . #% The future financing of EU enlargement was a centre-stage issue at the Brussels Summit . #% Secondly will the Spanish presidency guarantee that it will put equal access and equal rights for all disabled people in the European Union at the top of the agenda ? #% I would also hope that the Belgium presidency would do the same on behalf of the Council for the 15 Member States . #% Many speakers have alluded to this . #% Therefore , it is incumbent on us , as we benefit spiritually from the material these people produce , to put in place protection to guarantee that their rights will not be usurped by pirates or others . #% Can I recall to the House that yesterday 's annual guidelines issued by the Commission urge Member States to avoid using state aids to postpone essential restructuring . #% There is a potential clash of legal opinion in this regard . #% This would be preceded by a national stock-taking to analyse which actors , laws and institutions influence the planning and management of the coastal zone in order to ensure convergence of public bodies and local initiatives , to be completed by the end of December 2002 . #% The people of Pakistan , and even more so the religious minorities , are , at the present time , caught between the institutional bigotry of the Pakistani state and , in some regions , the ultra-reactionary and obscurantive forces of the Taliban . #% Mr President , most of what needs saying has been said at this point . #% That is people power ! #% Firstly , I am disappointed that the minimum allocation for the Leader axis in the budget will be reduced to 5 % . #% This will strengthen our hand in combatting organized crime and I do hope that the applicant countries will keep pace with us in this regard , not least in the area of dissuasive criminal penalties . #% It is essential that the Presidency make human rights a core part of all dialogue with China . #% Mr President , I supported the amendments to the Müller report , though every fibre of my being wanted to deliver a body blow to Dr Rath - spelled r-a-t ? - and his minions , who have placed this Parliament under siege not just for the past few months , but for a year . #% I am tired of people saying that when you question America , somehow you are not one of its friends . #% It would be very difficult for those who propose a ` yes ' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission . #% The summit meeting in Cardiff provides an ideal opportunity for the European Union to assess how best it can aid the process of peace and reconciliation which was given this overwhelming support by the Irish people and the referendum . #% The preferred weapons of terrorism are a few ounces of semtex in a holdall , a motor car , semi-automatic rifles and handguns-look at the experience of terrorism anywhere in the world-these are the weapons that are in use . #% Mr President , I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Queiró on an excellent piece of work . #% I am now asking you , Mr President , to ensure that you conduct the vote tomorrow in an orderly way , to ensure that Parliament and its Members are permitted to vote as they are empowered to do by their democratic mandate to draft and make legislation . #% The Royal Society in the United Kingdom pointed out that the so-called solution of deep geological burial has many uncertain points which need to be solved technically . #% The amount of money given has been a decreasing portion of farmer spending over the past number of years . #% Legally-binding targets for renewable energies are an important part of this strategy , but we must also have very clearly the externalisation of internal costs in respect of traditional energy production . #% One of the important issues raised within the discussions at conciliation and also within the report itself is in clearing up some of the wording used . #% However , I know that in the future you will recognise it depends very much on who is asking the question , and then you will decide whether or not you should come . #% Unfortunately , the interpretation did not come through in time , so the vote that I cast for the first part should have been for part two . #% It is no accident that when the French Republic gave the people of the United States a gift to celebrate 100 years of that great republic , that they called that statue ` Liberty ' : no accident either that her extended arms should carry a torch of freedom . #% Mr President , it is ten years since I was in Beijing representing the Irish Government as a Minister of State and I am happy to be here today to reaffirm the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action . #% With only two minutes available to me , I have to be selective . #% First of all we should remember that we are dealing with an extremely poor part of the world : half a million people with a GDP per capita of something like ECU 600 annually or 3 % of the European Union average . #% Since my time is limited , I want to focus politically just on two issues . #% In the Council of Ministers the unanimity rule must be removed in almost all areas . #% Could we request that the bells be rung a little bit earlier ? #% In conclusion , I support the proposals in the report . #% As far as research is concerned , and after very many long discussions with Mr Bourlanges , I am interested to know what he intends to do . #% I would like to see this situation immediately eased and I have made representations to the relevant minister in this regard . #% I believe that the European Commission , the European Parliament and the national member governments should redouble their efforts to publicise the public health information campaign ; this should be done either via the respective Departments of Health or through voluntary groups who play such an important role in helping those who are affected by such diseases . #% in writing . - This is a major report with important consequences for EU citizens . #% There is a huge lack of medical supplies and there are , I will agree , structural problems over and above the recent disasters of the tidal wave , etc. . #% Madam President , firstly I should to thank the Belgian government for outlining in its legislative agenda the priorities it intends to pursue during its six month presidency of the Union . #% Let us really look at what is happening in the European Union at the present time . #% Madam President , I originally drafted the opinion on fuels for the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy but now speak for the Socialist Group . #% Until we are willing to stand up to these powers our resolutions will remain impotent and ineffective . #% It is quite clear that smoking is a danger to health . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to participate in this historic debate and I look forward to the day , which is now just around the corner , when the representatives of each of the candidate countries will exercise their full rights as Members of this House and in each of the institutions of the European Union . #% While the Commission is correct to propose simplifying the rules of origin , I support the rapporteur in his view that all risks should not be borne by EU-based importers and furthermore , that the poorest countries should not be penalised in any reform . #% I would urge that when we enter into the detailed negotiations on sugar we not only consider the economic and trade issues but also take on board the social and moral dimensions of our decisions . #% Nevertheless there have been many cases where passengers have been denied boarding because of overbooking -- something which many in this Parliament will have experienced regarding some airlines in Europe -- and people have been left high and dry , whether it be in Brussels or somewhere else . #% An awful lot of people right round the world look to Europe as the only transnational , democratic institution that has the capacity to try to rein in the forces that they see destroying the world . #% I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions , including the energy sector . #% I have not spoken about any monetarist approach . #% Were he to be expelled on a technicality , as an act of solidarity I would wish to be expelled with him . #% I shall answer the first myself : will world trade -- free trade -- deliver sufficient global food supply ? #% I would just like to say that I propose to raise this matter with the Bureau this evening . #% However , I would suggest that the technicians and those responsible for this wonderful piece of equipment should modify it in such a way that would allow us to vote on all the candidates , plus and minus , which means that every single one of them will have a neutral symbol beside it . #% Finally , could I gently take issue with Mrs Van Brempt , who has done a lot of work in this area , and point out to her that my gender certainly did not pre-programme my views on this issue . #% 
Mr Maat was right when he said that the Commission must make a good job of it . #% However , I would like to see a bottom line which can give some sort of hope to the disadvantaged regions and the fishing communities . #% Secondly , we are adamant that no potential agreement with Morocco should involve any access to waters of Western Sahara . #% Mr President , my first reaction to Mrs Hautala 's report is to ask why the Committee on Economic Affairs and Industrial Policy was given the task of dealing with a subject that belongs more appropriately , in my opinion , to the Committee on Agriculture and to the Committee on Transport and Tourism . #% I wish to assure the honourable Member that I shall use any opportunity I have to raise this issue . #% They also want these drugs to be regulated . #% It is a Treaty language and it should have that status . #% We also have a situation where , with the rise of unemployment , many of those who have been brought to Ireland as legal workers are being let go simply because it is no longer convenient for employers to have them . #% The principle of cross-compliance , which means compliance with environmental and safety laws , is an important part of Parliament 's proposals . #% The distribution of direct payments in Ireland may be more equitable than in other EU countries , as there are relatively few very large farms , particularly arable farms . #% Good-quality , effective and simple legislation in the internal market should open up opportunities for cross-border trade and give consumers increased choice , while protecting environmental , social and consumer rights . #% This has been done in a rather sly , hypocritical and misleading way in that not simply different dates , but also different procedures -- with stem cell lines and not with embryos -- have been proposed . #% There was also a problem in that we were unable to visit certain areas for security reasons . #% However , what did the Committee on Fisheries do ? #% I entirely support the creation of a European Research Council to give some coordination and coherence to our work , particularly in basic research . #% We are also sending soldiers to stop the fighting there despite the fact that most of the fighting is taking place with weapons supplied by countries within the European Union . #% Prices collapse , there is terrible hardship and indeed terrible profiteering by middlemen . #% It is essential that the Intergovernmental Conference is not allowed to withdraw into the shadows . #% In practice , the obligation to review is one of the most important requirements in the report , and for that I thank the Members . #% It respects our rules in Parliament on the new comitology procedure . #% That is the kind of success that can be achieved by the Committee on Petitions and we need more resources if the Committee on Petitions is to do its work effectively . #% Perhaps the tragedy of his death will intensify regional and international pressure on the FNL to sign up to the peace agreement following their long-overdue talks with the government , so that no more lives are needlessly lost and so that peace is finally restored to Burundi . #% If you look at why Ireland is divided , it is because the successful people were given small pieces of land . #% One way , though certainly not the only way , of creating jobs is to make ourselves more competitive through research and development . #% Can we see legislative programmes directed towards that ? #% We would have hoped that as this millennium ends we would have left the spectre of war in Europe behind us . #% Whatever the reasons for this delay , what is certain is that in its 1997 report the Commission cited it as a reason not to entertain the problems that Ireland had with the 1985 Directive , despite the fact that , as I said , the delay was caused solely by the Commission . #% However , regions like mine , which have not and still do not qualify for cohesion funding , have greater difficulty in bringing their water treatment infrastructure up to acceptable standards . #% It currently seems to be attempting to turn MAGP from a programme to reduce fishing fleet capacity by decommissioning , scrapping etc. , into a programme to limit the fishing efforts which the fleets are allowed to make . #% Sinn Féin believes that the enlarged EU must adopt a new set of priorities . #% In relation to waste , the problem with Ireland is that it is failing to comply with the waste directive . #% We have not had too much experience of journeys to us as oppposed to our students going to Eastern European countries and that is an area where our education could be considerably improved . #% I also wish to say that the PSE Group will not accept amendments to this report which seek to weaken it . #% There are always consequences when we go against nature . #% I too want to congratulate Mr Hallam on his report and thank him for his heroic efforts to shed light on a very complicated subject . #% We all want to see democracy restored in Pakistan . #% I would say that people power can win the day over bureaucracy and legal barriers . #% Madam President , I want to congratulate Mr Kellett-Bowman , Mr Tomlinson , the committee , and indeed the staff who have worked so hard on this particular report . #% But it is very difficult for Members to sit right through every single question during Question Time just in case we jump from No 1 to No 99 in a matter of seconds . #% ( Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution ) Joint motion for a resolution on the closure of Chernobyl nuclear power plant by 2000 and completion of Khmelnitsky and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors in Ukraine #% However , the freedom to provide services has in the case of the gambling sector clashed with national law in a number of Member States , which have introduced restrictive laws limiting the cross-border supply of online betting and gambling services . #% Maritime safety is a priority and we must do all we can to ensure that human error is kept to a minimum . #% The Commission 's proposals have been sensible , following the lines of the European Parliament 's temporary committee . #% This approach requires EU farmers to sell their products below the cost of production and depend for their income solely on partial compensation . #% Traditional herbal medicines have been used in our societies from the earliest times . #% The rapporteur is correct , however , in pointing out that the European Parliament must be consulted again if an extension of the card to include personal medical data is proposed -- indeed , this has already been suggested -- as the proper protection of personal information -- particularly of a medical nature -- is a major concern . #% Why not put in place a similar requirement on on-line trading companies ? #% There was a lot of debate in this House about whether artwork sold by auction would go to America rather than to Europe if we adopted this legislation . #% While the EU has been helpful in providing additional resources , more is always necessary . #% We have only to look at the Argentinean case . #% Mr President , the image of the European Union has suffered greatly because of recent scandals relating to fraud . #% I understand that it will be very difficult and take time to secure agreement between all the parties involved - our trade partners and everyone else . #% The challenge for all of us is to put in place mechanisms , and crucially resources , to realise these goals . #% During this past year , several of the states in the Helsinki group have already in effect caught up with those in the earlier Luxembourg group . #% But the system , as Lord Inglewood has said , has to be attractive to industry and business otherwise it will simply be an irrelevance . #% It is important that safety criteria form the basis of the directive , rather than arbitrary recommended daily allowances which would be unnecessarily restrictive and not related to safety . #% We have this tradition of regulation by professional bodies , not with the kind of legal base that is common in other states of the Union . #% Since you , Commissioner , will evidently be using the European Group on Ethics as an instrument for conducting the framework programme on research , can you let us know to what extent you will inform Parliament about the advice given to you by that group , about the composition of the group and indeed the discussions that you have with the group and with its Chair - when that person arrives ? #% I also believe that , as Commissioner Patten mentioned , this involves basically the whole issue of a European arms industry . #% That is how it came across in the interpretation . #% I want to focus my remarks this evening on the fishing industry , and of course one of the sectors excluded is sea fishing . #% Sustained attacks by Israel on the Palestinian Authority and its security forces and facilities are wholly misguided . #% A European policy aimed at supporting young farmers and linked to the CAP is essential . #% In particular , we have had rather a long debate about the potential humanitarian crisis . #% The implementation of the Waste Management Act of 1995 is also a positive step in the right direction . #% Let us not forget that every time we use a computer , whether it is to buy Christmas gifts or to book flights , data is already being retained by companies on those websites to target marketing and other products towards us . #% 
However , the thrust of this proposal would improve the functioning of the single market and , crucially , would greatly assist in our goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions , without compromising the ability of any country to levy its own taxes . #% Agriculture in my constituency of Northern Ireland still remains our most significant industry . #% There continues to be a barbarous war in Iraq . #% We need to continue to deliver a road map of cohesive solutions to the threat of climate change , ensuring that Member State flexibility is at its heart . #% I am referring in particular to the young and long-term unemployed still concentrated in certain urban and rural areas of the European Union . #% A European strategy must also seek to safeguard the existence of services that guarantee maximum possible coverage and equal conditions and treatment for all patients . #% It is quite extraordinary that we have this situation . #% I do not think that individuals should have the right , just because they have the money and capacity and because they happen to live in a certain region , to go out and exploit those resources and become very rich as has happened in some instances . #% One other concern of mine is that some Member States will give these proposals good support and others , including my own , will do what they have always done with such initiatives : nothing ! #% In addition , as Mr Hughes pointed out , the other parts of the entitlements come into force immediately . #% We must define exactly and precisely what we mean by terrorism . #% It is absolutely imperative that neither the chief electoral observer nor any of the team pursues a political agenda in relation to the country they are observing . #% I agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mr Cappato . #% And we should not hesitate to tell our people who live in Western Europe today , that they have better lives than any previous generation anywhere . #% . Discussions are already under way in relation to how the EU budget for the year 2000 will be disbursed . #% What industry needs more than anything is legal certainty and , given the precedent case law , this is not the direction in which we are going . #% The European Union has now ensured that the tools of war have been put aside in favour of the development of new policies . #% I agree that we need a properly functioning carbon credit market . #% I do not think that taking these steps which have been proposed in relation to TACIS would necessarily have the effect the honourable Member suggested . #% Again , I agree with the Commissioner . #% Key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe . #% I know it will also increase the size of the European Union as a trading block which in time will ensure that the Union as an economic entity becomes more competitive . #% What is wrong with having a system whereby you have to account for what you spend ? #% Above all , let us look at the salaries paid to scientists and technologists . #% The EU must learn from the best practice techniques available within the European Union to tackle health disorders , such as asthma , childhood allergies and neuro-development disorders . #% We simply wanted to ensure that premiums were paid on sheep and goats that actually existed and that we had a means of ensuring that the animals could be counted and accounted for . #% This report will be submitted at a later date under a legal basis that is clear . #% In conclusion , I believe that efficient , cheap and sustainable energy production is a key element in achieving our goal . #% A new framework directive on services -- a key measure needed to complete the internal market -- must also be implemented . #% Our separate role should be to analyse critically the performance of the Council and the Commission in relation to meeting targets set out in key areas outlined in an EU annual human rights report . #% We need to have an open debate on the legal basis issue in this House urgently . #% Its ceasefire is fragile , its political prospects uncertain . #% In the intervening 80 years , the ILO has responded to the needs of people all around the globe for decent jobs , livelihoods and dignity . #% And we also need a very serious information campaign sponsored by the European Union . #% We would like to see the rights of the pro-democracy movement in Indonesia recognized . #% It is time to focus on the humanitarian needs of this long-suffering people and on the reconstruction of this beautiful country . #% We should also pave the way for the immediate introduction of trade and other economic sanctions in the event of China reneging on its promises . #% Every effort must be made to put in place the Compromise reached at Davos which will allow for a copper-fastening of EU-South African relations . #% Quota hopping must be dealt with , and in the Irish Sea the Hague preference , which totally distorts fishing quotas , should be abolished . #% This assistance includes help for educational programmes , reconciliation schemes , the provision of shelters for refugees , constructing border crossing-points as well as supporting infrastructure projects such as the building of roads and the clearing of the Danube river of pollutants . #% I fully understand and believe that this is not going to be an easy task , but we must not underestimate the challenges that lie before us . #% I endorse the commitment given at the Copenhagen Summit to start the negotiations with Turkey in 2004 , subject , of course , to a review on progress on human rights and rule of law issues . #% Today we , the European Parliament drawn from 25 Member States , add our voice to that of the Irish Government , the British Government and the United States Congress , in support of the McCartney campaign for justice . #% I accept the Commissioner 's reasoning that there must be greater concentration of resources in the next perspective . #% At least 62 Japanese-built flags-of-convenience longliners will be scrapped by the end of 2002 . #% Worryingly , the aspect of the struggle to combat terrorism that we are losing is the battle to win public support -- the hearts and minds of large populations in the Arab world in particular . #% We in the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission can not renege on our responsibility here . #% Let us work towards that as technology develops , but to sit here and say that we can impose this from this European Parliament is totally unacceptable . #% I should like to ask the President of Parliament to send a goodwill message to the Speaker of that Assembly in view of the difficult role and task she has ahead of her . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome the Commissioner and to thank the rapporteur for his report . #% So I wholeheartedly agree with the establishment of the public-private partnership arrangement to ensure that the monies and the extra revenues which are created because of the single market within the European Union are put back into the European Union rather than allowing money which is invested in pension funds and so on to be invested in countries outside the European Union , which means that the Union as a whole loses all that money . #% Can we resolve that we will examine the situation of carers and that we will include them in our recommendations on work in future , and that we will no longer discriminate against this important workforce which is already discriminated in the area of pay . #% As far as I can see , the officials based in these information offices rarely , if ever , make any serious efforts to defend the interests of this Parliament and its Members when these types of attacks are made . #% Safety refresher courses must take place on an annual basis . #% Consequently , I could not today vote for the censure motion on the Commission tabled by those who want what I believe to be outrageous measures applied to my country . #% What proposals for financial help were requested ? #% The exceptions which currently exist in Article 5 mean that the generous provisions on exceptions that we have in the UK will continue to help vulnerable users and ensure that schools , libraries and research and education institutions can benefit from private copying . #% Last year in Ireland house prices were forecast to increase by 9 % by estate agents Hook and McDonald , by between 8 % and 10 % by Sherry Fitzgerald and by 7 % by Friends First and IIB , while Allied Irish Banks forecast an increase of between 3 % and 6 % . #% However , there is clearly a role for the EU , to assist Member States ' agencies in sharing models of best practice and ensuring a level of consistency throughout the European Union . #% There are obvious political and constitutional issues here , which are perhaps more obvious to me , given where I come from , than to some others . #% Europe has experienced a great increase in pressures on coastal resources . #% This will give us the strongest position when we negotiate with the Council . #% It is obvious from the debate here that we could in fact have constructed a resolution on a wide range of issues on which we agree . #% I warmly welcome the statement made by the President to us here this morning . #% These are the problems that are swaying the balance between life and death for Haitians . #% Let us get real about this . #% 
the wearing of religious symbols at school . #% I want to make the point that in our anxiety to protect consumers we must be equally careful not to over-regulate a sector which has the capacity to produce a diverse range of quality food . #% I would like in conclusion to point out that the Council had already adopted this proposal last Monday . #% I believe that the ECB should follow this formula and develop an ECB formula because , at present , we are leaving it to people who are involved in the industry to make the forecasts , and they are the people - the financial institutions and others - who have most to gain . #% I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities , the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports . #% Mr President , the introduction of a single currency in Europe was never going to be a simple task , but with 11 countries within the Union covering a population of 300 million , I fully support the single currency . #% The interim report is not a perfect one , but the acceptance of PPE-DE amendments will add balance to a text worth supporting . #% Why do you not listen ? #% Against the background of the recent recovery , any further raising of interest rates should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth . #% Therefore , in the light of these discussions , I wish to take some time to highlight a potential approach that my group will be taking during the reform process . #% Does the Commission agree that there is an urgent need for common security standards for all nuclear installations , not just in the EU-15 , but in accession countries as well ? #% How can the Commission propose that an acceptable regional policy can be extended to the new states with just ECU 11 billion ? #% This is an extremely important matter for this Parliament , which is concerned because the European Union provides Guarantee Funds to the EIB . #% It is reckoned that approximately EUR 2.5 billion will be lost by the European aviation industry between now and the end of the year , and that some 20 000 jobs will be lost . #% This is the only practical way to administer treatment in the case of a disease outbreak in large units . #% We need to address how we protect the external borders of the European Union . #% The Treaty of Nice allows a core group of Member States to form an elite inner circle . #% I therefore ask the Commission to clarify its position on supplementary measures . #% However , I would hate it if people - especially the people in the gallery watching us today - went away from this Chamber thinking that this is merely an opportunity for the European Union to bash America . #% I am happy to see included in this report a recommendation to Member States to improve the provision of services of general interest in rural areas , thereby promoting an equitable balance between rural and urban living , in particular for older people . #% Mr President , after 30 long years of negotiations , the Employment and Social Affairs Ministers managed to reach agreement last December on a statute for a European company . #% Belmarsh security unit in England , which I visited recently , is a virtual concrete tomb in which prisoners are incarcerated for long periods of time . #% Otherwise , we can not meet the deadline . #% The Irish Labour Party does not support the introduction of CCCTB . #% The Maastricht Treaty allowed for the creation of Europol as an intelligence-gathering agency on the illegal drugs trade . #% The committee is also going to need more time to carry out a comprehensive , comparative analysis into the operation of similar life assurance markets in Germany and in Ireland . #% Mr President , I was in Parliament in the summer of 1995 when the appalling crimes of Mr Dutroux were exposed . #% In his hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , Mr Solana talked about having a less declaratory and more active foreign policy . #% Stocks of blue and white marlin are severely depleted in the Atlantic and they do need protection . #% The first step in the current peace process was taken when Israel and Egypt concluded the peace treaty at Camp David in 1979 . #% The Commission proposal , which makes it possible to sell chocolate with vegetable fat in all 15 Member States instead of the present 7 , is , in my view , to be commended , thus allowing the internal market to function properly . #% The food scares experienced in recent years must never again be allowed to reach proportions which threaten European consumers , farmers and the agrifood industry . #% To me it sounds incredible that we can find billions to inflict the torture of war on humanity and still not have the resources to address the basic human needs of those living in the depths of poverty and despair . #% I indicated that I wanted to make my explanation of vote in writing and I was told that I would have to be here for the vote in the first instance and that I would have to wait until I was called to indicate that I wanted to make it in writing . #% Post-crisis , there needs to be an incentive for intellectuals and artists to use their creativity and publish new material , without fear , online . #% The time has come for us in this Parliament , on behalf of the European citizens , to establish our authority and leadership in this vital area of international trade . #% He had to leave earlier this afternoon and he forgot to sign a letter asking for me to take his question on his behalf . #% When that paper came out we saw it as a challenge to change . #% Even the WTO itself recently confirmed to us that the US clearly agree because this is the basis which they use to ban the import and sale of dog and cat fur . #% Mr President , I commend the two rapporteurs and agree with what has already been said here tonight . #% There is a situation I remember in Yes Minister , a British television programme which many us have often enjoyed , in which Sir Humphrey announces that although they have the hospital they can not afford to have any patients . #% At the same time we have Mr Barroso offering deals which undermine pledges given to farmers in the context of CAP reform , in order to move Prime Minister Blair on the budget . #% Giving the United Nations the lead role in post-war Iraq , as EU leaders have requested , would be the clearest demonstration on the part of the United States that it values the transatlantic relationship and it genuinely wants to rebuild it . #% A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators . #% It is correctly suggested in one of the amendments that we legislate for acceptable feeding regimes for the cattle whose meat is imported . #% Furthermore there is a need to broaden the definition of accidental marine pollution to include operational historical and radioactive and other harmful substances , accidental and operational marine pollution . #% The waste is shipped through the Irish Sea , thus making it the most radioactive body of water in the world . #% I would like to commend the Commissioner for her decisive action in putting a proposal to the Venice informal Council to improve the efficiency of structural funds . #% Commissioner Barnier probably said to you today , Commissioner Wallström , that all European programmes should be able to start without undue delay because it can be extremely difficult to make up for lost time later on . #% We have been inviting him for over six months and apparently he is far too busy to join us , but he would be very welcome . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I welcome the Taoiseach here for an honest discussion about the future of Europe , but , as I was once told when asking for directions , I would not start from here . #% In terms of implants for purely cosmetic reasons , we need to look at what the advertising industry is doing in relation to coercing people into something that they may regret in later years . #% However , there are a number of dangers and risks and in particular , I want to deal with two aspects . #% A lasting solution must be a political one . #% The British government should make the honourable decision to close this nuclear white elephant once and for all . #% Under the Spanish Presidency the new charter for small and medium-sized enterprises was put into effect to help European business grow and prosper more easily . #% Beef farmers are still suffering from the aftermath of the BSE crisis in the UK , which has thrown the whole beef industry into a spiralling free fall , with consumption badly damaged . #% After the Dutroux scandal in Belgium there was a flurry of activity and there seemed to be a determination to ensure that Europol would be given the necessary powers to discharge its responsibilities . #% There is a danger that the current unprecedented crises in the livestock sector - mainly BSE and foot-and-mouth - might be used to introduce far-reaching reforms to the common agricultural policy which would not otherwise have been contemplated . #% I hope that the fact we have already done something to deal with the problem of these wretched plastic bags will not be held against us in relation to targets . #% Clearly there is a major problem with the lifting of the arms embargo on China , particularly in the light of what has happened in recent years . #% Parliament immediately reacted with a counterproposal , but this was not reflected in the Council 's position . #% Foolish reports like this do more to assist euroscepticism than anything else I can think of . #% In the case of other countries it means bigger sugar industries . #% By facilitating them in harming themselves or assisting them to avoid putting themselves in danger ? #% Therefore some people want to accept the advice of ICES only when it suits . #% 
This is a major issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the Commission . #% It is not good enough for us to wring our hands and declare we are sorry . #% Mr President , as the late Tip O'Neill said : ' All politics is local ' . #% As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union , surely it should receive priority consideration . #% I was surprised to see you quoted in my press as threatening to cut off European funding . #% I can not work out whether there is a proposal to provide new moneys to compensate the displaced fishermen or whether the Commissioner is saying that the governments of the States concerned - be it France , the United Kingdom or Ireland - should propose a compensation programme using the resources already provided and no new money and resources are available . #% I support a review of the rules governing the Stability and Growth Pact . #% It should be given the specific tasks of ensuring that the public is adequately protected on the one hand and , on the other , that new developments in food production be carefully explained at an early stage . #% We also need to ensure that people of a different generation from the present younger generation are not disadvantaged because of lack of access to training for this new means of communication and this new information network . #% One point which I should like to stress from the outset is the gains for small organizations who become partners . #% It is totally immoral that we should increase the prosperity of the European Union at the expense of the people of developing countries . #% Software is not an invention and is already protected under copyright law , just like books , films and music . #% He would have been proud of the work done by our rapporteur , Mrs Gebhardt , and all the Members who have worked so hard to improve and amend the Commission proposal . #% The fact of the matter is that the only international instrument which is designed to prevent and punish currency counterfeiting is the Geneva Convention of 1929 . #% I believe that for some people who have the money to buy large ships and equip them in today 's world there is no limit to the capacity that can be applied to extracting resources from the sea . #% I will certainly draw the exchanges in this Question Time to the attention of Minister Yates , who is President-in-Office of the Agriculture Council to ensure that he is aware of the concerns of the honourable Member . #% Would the President 's office undertake a review of the 25 Member States to see which arrangements are in place allowing these European citizens to vote in states which are not their own ? #% I would challenge him to back up his statement in this House tonight that there is already adequate protection for Irish workers in this area . #% We have been very cooperative on the Energy Star programme . #% Would the Minister think that it might be a good idea to promote the development of the wool industry so that farmers would have a better income and perhaps would need less of the ECU 2 billion subsidization that we pay annually ? #% Mr President , I also want to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent report he has produced . #% The rapid growth of online services and remote gambling and betting services has de facto already erased national boundaries . #% Finally , although it is not in the report , if we are ultimately to have a European driver 's licence , we should look at a different model from the one-test-for-a-lifetime model that we have in Europe . #% The aim of this proposal is to provide for the participation of Switzerland in the Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning programmes . #% There is general agreement on this . #% The amendments proposed by Parliament do not concern the substance of the DCI or the other instruments , but the role of Parliament in the practical implementation of the law . #% I would like that proposal to be minuted . #% Certain amendments proposed by the ECON committee have called for uniformity in certain areas by 2010 , including tax , effectively restricting the application of national law . #% We are happy to note that , but progress will not be sustained unless there is equality for all its citizens , and particularly the weaker ones . #% I would like the Commission to give us a few answers on this . #% We must now ensure that we pick ourselves up from this position and play a central role in providing all the necessary humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq over the coming months . #% Mr Tillich makes the point about his four priorities , which Mr Fabra Vallés referred to and supported . #% Again , short food miles and local branding are essential . #% So NGOs are pulling their people out of Darfur while indiscriminate attacks continue on civilians . #% Given that it is the objective of the Commission , and indeed of the European Union , that increases in traffic should be absorbed by the rail system , does the Commissioner not think that there is a conflict here between what we are seeking to achieve , in relation to the moving of goods in particular , and that he should at least talk to the Irish Government about establishing some coordination between the White Paper , the proposed national transport policy which the government claims it is working on , and the proposal to close the rail network in Ireland ? #% There is no specific treatment or vaccine available yet for the ravages of Ebola , which has hit the headlines in recent years in these parts and which has killed 1 200 since the virus was first discovered . #% We can not seriously ask the people to support us in the European elections next year and at the same time pretend we do not have a role and that we have nothing to say about the direction the world is going in . #% In both cases the government , farming organisations and farmers are committed to eliminating any possible threat to the environment and in particular the quality of groundwater . #% Galileo can play a key role in helping the European Union achieve the competitiveness goals set in Lisbon , goals which form a key plank of the Irish presidency 's programme . #% As I said , in Northern Ireland we have full traceability and our measures go beyond the regulations . #% We will not vote until we have had a statement from the Commission , because of the very strange procedure being adopted . #% However , with a referendum taking place in Ireland next week , I felt that it would not be appropriate to participate in this vote as it is broader than the text of the Treaty itself . #% It is up to the Member States to formulate the most appropriate and responsible policies aimed at integrating religious minorities into society . #% The challenges facing us today are not about the distant future , or even the failed ideologies of the past . #% However , in all truth it must be said that decisions taken at these summits and any that may be taken at Feira will remain little more than aspirational until the Union has the necessary resources to implement such a policy . #% In 1985 the Irish Government failed to obtain a derogation , as Mrs Fontaine has said , from the strictest provisions in the directive concerning recognition of architects ' qualifications . #% My colleagues from the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy and myself welcomed the particular agreement with the Republic of Yemen in December . #% We started out with 65 paragraphs and ended up with 95 . #% To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy , our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense , are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole . #% We must improve the methods of monitoring and impose stronger penalties for breaches . #% This includes public participation and the drawing up of certain plans and programmes , greater participation in the procedure concerning the implementation of environmental impact assessment statements as well as in the putting in place of integrated pollution prevention and control measures . #% I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner . #% I am further disappointed at the hypocritical stance adopted by the Irish Government . #% The continuing decline in the number engaged in farming and the deteriorating age profile of farmers are social indicators which we ignore at our peril . #% I have been in contact with the Irish Minister responsible for language matters and I believe that it would be very difficult to sustain the same level of interest in the Bureau among Irish government circles , should the Bureau be forced to close its Dublin office . #% Mr President , Parliament maintains a network of information offices in the national capitals of each of the Member States . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I wish to draw your attention to an article in the Spanish newspaper El País , dated 30 March and headed ` Eavesdropping on half a dozen countries at Council headquarters . #% The European Peace Fund 2000-2004 supported 4 000 projects in Northern Ireland and the border county region alone . #% I would appreciate it if you would be open to amending the way in which this matter is being handled . #% Down the road this Parliament will find itself having to address the serious problem of the human resources of agriculture necessary for the continuity of the agricultural sector . #% Cooperatives and credit unions were also mentioned . #% I would urge the Commission again to examine the possibilities and its policy in relation to food aid . #% Maybe we asked for some initiatives but , on reflection , we would say that they are not such a priority after all . #% Alas , I think that for Ireland it will mean that we will have no industry at all . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the work carried out on this report . #% It is certainly the most contentious political issue . #% 
Finally , we should never underestimate the role of individual responsibility . #% I note in particular that the Council has failed to include minimum distances from residential areas for landfills which contain either hazardous or non-hazardous waste . #% Could he indicate whether this will continue , with additional collective responsibility , into the future ? #% I have in my hand a letter from the Finance Minister in my region which admits that EU funds acquired for Northern Ireland are diverted instead directly into the UK central Exchequer and are thereby used to reduce the level of UK-wide taxation and borrowing that is then necessary . #% We had the widest grasp of any committee . #% We are now 34 million over the planned budget due to demands for yet more staff and other start-up costs , and the EEAS is n't even operational ! #% Because the new technologies which have been brought forward do offer new opportunities for communications and for greater interaction of people with disabilities and the wider community that should be encouraged and given at a lower rate . #% I realise it is difficult for colleagues from other Member States to realise how low farm incomes have fallen in my country , Ireland , mainly due to the fact that Ireland is heavily dependent on export markets , both in the EU and in third countries . #% EU fleets are already active in many oceans around the world and often cause considerable damage . #% This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution . #% I am asking the Commissioner , given that the UK now has the highest poverty rate in the EU - one in three babies is born into families in poverty - to look at the model of job creation and sustainable high-value , highproductivity jobs to give EU regions a competitive edge in Europe . #% For the Parliament , this entire debate has represented a coming of age , a new maturity in understanding our democratic rights and our capacity and our duty to act in the public interest when we assert them . #% I have a number of concerns which include a major doubt about the legal bases ; serious questions concerning the lack of protection and safeguards , particularly the use of surveillance measures and coercive methods ; permitting evidence to be used that would be inadmissible in an Irish court ; undermining Irish Constitutional protection for defendants ; allowing self-incrimination . #% Because the Irish Government did not do due diligence in its negotiations with the Commission for the compensation package as part of the closure of Mallow and Carlow under temporary sugar restructuring rules , we now find that the Commission is inflexible about turning these factories into ethanol-producing plants . #% However , major players now need to be more proactive in convincing countries with the highest levels of pollution : the United States and developing countries . #% But I wish to conclude by reassuring the honourable Member of our understanding and sympathy towards the problems she expresses . #% Things are happening in this important field . #% I hope you will be tough too on core labour standards . #% It is nothing short of scandalous that the Europol Convention is not ratified . #% The Commission , the Committee on Fisheries and the Council all claim to agree with the precautionary approach , which states that the absence of definite proof should not be used to refuse action to prevent a decline in fish stocks . #% In the light of the mayhem of communal strife , street violence , intimidation , murder and bombing which has returned to Northern Ireland , unfortunately , in the past 10 days , I want first of all to place on record my group 's utter condemnation of that descent towards the abyss . #% We must become the heralds of a new world , a world that recognises those fundamental and basic rights of freedom , the right to life , the right to liberty , the right to security . #% This is due legal process . #% If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level , this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , including Community actions , on energy saving . #% It should not be an ` us and them ' situation ; it should be about everyone working together for the betterment of all people in the 25 Member States -- or perhaps the 27 Member States , should that come about . #% I think our care for the children involved is central to it , and that must be the beginning and the end of this debate . #% Many colleagues are finding it particularly difficult this week in the heat . #% Europe must stand up to the Bush administration which seems to see us as ` client states ' who will rubber-stamp their every excess . #% We have given Greenland a deal that it had no right to expect , seeing that it voluntarily walked away and did not accept in good faith that it would have been fairly treated within the Union . #% This should also be the case with Equatorial Guinea . #% I would like to see a more concerted effort by the Commission directorates to work closely at all levels , not only between Commissioners but also between policy directorates , to take up the challenges of EMU , enlargement and the future reform of the structural funds . #% Do you share my concerns that economic growth is not converting to jobs ? #% What did we achieve in conciliation ? #% So Mr Flynn , our Commissioner , is to be congratulated and I would urge Members to vote in support of the common position . #% Could you address the realities in the different Member States , which must be of concern to the Council ? #% Equally , we must have redress for the consumer and sanctions if these alternative regulations fail to deliver benefits for the consumer in the internal market . #% If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development , it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job . #% Indeed , the largest voluntary association in Ireland is the Gaelic Athletic Association . #% Mr President , it is clear , as Mrs Green said , that we are now in a position where we have established the principles from the earlier vote , and we should try to accommodate that at this stage . #% From the Commission report I am pleased to note that , globally , the results are positive . #% We have to look at how the European Union Member States fuel conflicts around the world and human rights abuses . #% This can be misused so that information which should be available is restricted under the guise of confidentiality . #% The time has come to make those who engage in the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms legally responsible for damage to human health and the environment . #% The Commissioner forces the banks in our country to resolve his problem of too much tonnage in EU waters by driving our Irish fishing fleet into bankruptcy . #% And I think the Commissioner should encourage the continuation of good cooperation because it creates a good atmosphere all round and creates a very good working relationship . #% I believe it is equally vital that the blacklist should also cover aircraft chartered from companies in non-EU countries and Member States should provide the European Commission with a list of carriers banned from their airspace . #% This resolution does not fully reflect the negotiating priorities agreed by the PPE and the PSE in the McCarthy/Hatzidakis resolution and , as such , can only give a partial and partisan view of Parliament 's priorities . #% Though there are now 25 Member States , the UK this year will contribute one eighth ( 12.4 % ) of the total budget revenue of # 83 billion required to fund the EU in 2006 . #% I have a great love of the Jewish people . #% I know some of your constituents , Mr President , suffered the same experience . #% It is important also that the precise role of the European Union President / President of the European Council is clearly specified in the new Treaty . #% I like Mr Deß 's idea of an amendment , and if he puts it forward I think I would like to support that amendment for a limit of two or even three years to get this job done . #% Suggestions , for example , that export refunds should be ended , would have disastrous consequences , particularly for Ireland where we export up to 90 percent of our entire agricultural production . #% Yes , we want informed choices from a health point of view -- everybody , not just employees , should be informed of the risks to over-exposure -- but please , say to President Barroso for all of us , that , if he is serious about Lisbon-proofing regulation and about less regulation being better regulation , then we do not need this nanny-type regulation and solar radiation must be removed from the directive . #% Mr President , the Lisbon process was important because it made a significant breakthrough by deciding to take an integrated approach to the economic employment and social policy dimensions to ensure that each was given an equal standing in terms of policy development . #% With regard to the financial perspective , the present one which runs from 1993 to 1999 was accompanied by an increase in the EU budget ceiling to 1.27 % of EU GNP . #% Two high-profile examples from Ireland -- Intel and Ryanair -- have been highly instructive in demonstrating how unreasonably applied competition policy can militate against competition . #% In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe . #% The best definition to date of the precautionary approach is the one contained in the UN fish stocks agreement , and many of these and other principles are defined there . #% I just want to agree with what my colleague Mr Fitzsimons says . #% Indeed , Sinn Féin , by its continued integral link with the IRA , is just as guilty , in spite of its claims . #% There is also a more sinister side to this counterfeiting and piracy . #% As the rapporteur has said , if we do not do something about fish stocks , there will be no fishing industry in the future as there will be no fish . #% The only logical response is to close them all down and end this terrible threat . #% That was why there was such universal goodwill and support for the brave steps taken by the current Prime Minister , Ranil Wickremesinghe , and the LTTE in launching a peace process to end the terrible conflict in which 65 000 people have lost their lives , many thousands have been maimed , and untold harm was inflicted on the economy and indeed the quality of life of the Sri Lankan people . #% As the Commissioner himself pointed out , investing money earlier is much more effective and more economical than spending money to pick up the pieces afterwards . #% 
The Council should be very much involved and should come forward in the very near future with plans and with some hope of a definite outcome in this important area . #% In conclusion , in our anxiety to safeguard the consumer interest - our main objective - we must also ensure that agriculture is allowed to benefit from the advances in modern technology . #% We pass laws every month for controls and limits that protect the vulnerable . #% Under the circumstances , when Israel does not clearly discharge its duty to apply the origin rules and the territorial clause of the agreement as it should , the Commission is encouraging Member States to resort to the import verification procedures which can be dilatory and evasive . #% What did the Commission do ? #% With regard to this report , I thank the rapporteur for his good work . #% It is a fairly simple idea , but it one which would , in my view , generate a lot of interest amongst the citizens of Europe . #% Also there have been cases highlighted where barriers were put in place and people who wanted to move from one Member State to the other could not have the qualifications recognised . #% We have delivered on our commitments , we must now ensure that we can deliver on our future promises for the future generations in Europe . #% Today in Parliament we voted against supporting the German peace proposal that has been put forward . #% A clear plan in this regard must be implemented by the year 2000 . #% I and many of my colleagues were caught in this dilemma . #% What we want to see now is a complete arms embargo on Indonesia and also an economic embargo . #% The background is that the fluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs . #% It takes two sides to make a debate . #% However , I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right , this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge , a quota per household for drinking , cooking and sanitation . #% This was an important decision , affirming the EU ' s readiness to provide humanitarian and development assistance to the people of Afghanistan . #% It is also important that the EU leads the way in establishing fundamental rights for the approximately 660 million people world-wide who have some form of disability - almost 10 % of the planet 's population . #% Personally , I am an enthusiastic supporter of enlargement but equally I have strong views as to how that enlarged Europe should be constructed . #% I am still not satisfied , however . #% That consensus is leading to the joint initiative he mentioned , which we shall be announcing tomorrow . #% There must be a speedy ratification by the Union 's Member States of the United Nations Convention for the suppressing of the financing of terrorism . #% Mr President , Commissioner , this proposal for a Council regulation concerns the prolongation of the fisheries protocol which has been in force between the EU and Senegal for the period of 1 May 1997 to 30 April 2001 . #% I am delighted that funding has now been extended to the end of 2006 and sincerely hope that further provision will be made in the Financial Perspectives when they are finally established and come into effect in 2007 . #% Clubs in my region are concerned that the money they invest in buying players will not give them a return on their investment and , as Mr Cushnahan said , they will not be interested in running football academies and in investing in the local community if they can not see a return on their investment . #% Mr President , I would like to remind both Mr Allister and Mr Nicholson , and indeed Mrs de Brún , that the rule of law applies in the Republic of Ireland and the law will take its course in the Republic of Ireland in relation to the case they mentioned . #% It is now time for all those involved in EU decision-making to demonstrate the necessary discipline and patience to avoid further failures and to await the report of the presidency to the Spring Summit . #% Closer trade ties between the EU and Canada can only be built on a basis of respect for the wishes of the European public and for European law . #% If someone from another planet saw us acting as if we had known that , they would think we were stupid . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by thanking the members of Committee on Budgetary Control for their kind cooperation with me in preparation of this report , both individually and by group . #% It is ten years since the NLD won a huge majority of seats in free and fair elections , but despite that , democracy has been suppressed from every angle and at every opportunity . #% The situation has altered substantially . #% The traditional roles of women in childcare and care for the elderly are all part of this wider debate and it is not possible to do justice to the subject in two minutes . #% What do we want , and what is the way forward ? #% I take note of what has been said in the General Affairs Council , namely that the Council will continue with the ratification process . #% Mr President , I believe it is important that we all use this opportunity to highlight the unfortunate rise in racism at football matches in Europe . #% The Khmer Rouge regime was one of the worst human rights abusers of the twentieth century , being responsible for an estimated 1.72 million deaths in a short , four-year rule . #% In fact , according to information available from studies carried out by the Irish road hauliers ' association it would increase the number of vehicles on the road and would neither reduce congestion nor lessen environmental damage . #% Those ultimately responsible for supplying the illegal drugs now available in communities throughout the Union have long operated on an international basis and effective action to curb their activities also demands a coordinated international response . #% But I am also determined to ensure , insofar as I can in my small way , that we have a united , coherent , cohesive , common European foreign and defence policy . #% On trade and development : my group supports the everything but arms proposition . #% I note what the Commissioner told us earlier . #% The variety of regional and lesser-used languages across the continent of Europe is an integral part of our unique cultural heritage . #% We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under . #% I can not understand how the Commission can go for a study by anonymous authors and ignore information provided by its own main committee . #% How do we keep avian flu highlighted so that we do not have a human pandemic and so that we spot the problem in wild birds , while at the same time trying to avoid scaring consumers ? #% But it seems we have ignored all the warnings . #% As Mr Dini said , we in the European Parliament are in the best position to reflect the concerns of our citizens . #% Madam President , I would like to speak in favour of Enrique Barón Crespo 's proposal for the reasons he has outlined so eloquently . #% One very important step that the Member States could take would be to reverse their position on the abolition of duty-free sales for internal EU travel . #% In addition , 13 Israeli Human Rights Organisations have protested to the Israeli Knesset and Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding the increasingly systematic campaign against Human Rights Organisations in Israel . #% I welcome the Irish Government 's talks this week with the new head of the American Environmental Protection Agency . #% Mr Barroso , you are no longer a Portuguese politician : you are a European politician , selected by this Parliament and by the Council of all of the Member States to represent Europe . #% Pre-term birth is the number one cause of infant death and premature babies are far more likely to develop lifelong chronic illnesses . #% There is a lesson to be learned here and greater transparency is needed in future . #% Beef producers , sheep producers , pig producers , poultry producers are all in a situation where they are making a loss . #% This is deliberate exploitation and ill-treatment of animals and should be taken into account as well . #% Community and local authority recycling facilities need to be practically located and accessible for maximum impact . #% I believe the onus is on the Turkish Government to ensure this happens . #% It is quite clear today that this is going happen and there needs to be a bit more honesty with the people . #% The President-in-Office has dealt very fully and sympathetically with this question . #% Having discussed this with Mrs Roth-Berendt , we have tabled Amendment No 51 to Article 5 as a compromise to this effect . #% We must always recall that economic sanctions are not against the government , they are against the people and it is the people of Albania who will suffer if there are economic sanctions . #% If this is the case does that mean that anyone , anywhere , can be stopped ? #% It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine , in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock . #% I am sure work on other strategic issues is ongoing . #% 
In my contribution last month I called for an EU taskforce to police the implementation of the control measures in Member States . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if he thinks that fuel reprocessing at Sellafield can possibly be compatible with the commitment to reduce emissions to zero , or virtually nil as he puts it ? #% However , we must not erode the credibility of the Convention by supporting scientifically weak proposals on this . #% While safety is their primary responsibility , they are mainly engaged in other tasks . #% We must guarantee that the forthcoming World Trade Organisation talks , which will take place in September , are a real success . #% They have been experienced in Ireland , Britain , Spain and other European countries : that is why we share and understand the pain of those who have suffered . #% This has to be a good omen for the future of the Cohesion Fund which has played and will continue to play a vitally important role for the participating countries . #% This is an area that is going to have to be given the closest attention . #% Sinn Féin supported the report to lend our weight in the European Parliament to this call . #% The European Union can have a role tin providing some of this leadership , including through rethinking its approach on aid to Palestine and its relations with Hamas . #% We must ensure that animals are not subjected to unnecessary suffering , and this is clearly unnecessary . #% I was not sniggering at the comment . #% Of course , if we are going to callously shut down sugar production in Ireland and the EU , we can and must properly compensate the farmers and producers ... even if just to salve our consciences . #% I would urge you , Mr President , to show some flexibility and to allow the House to vote on the request by Mrs Müller . #% I hope that you will continue to monitor developments in a pragmatic way . #% Can the President-in-Office give the House an update on research in these areas and how soon we can expect a positive breakthrough in the area of alternative fuels ? #% I just want to make one point in relation to this whole issue of foot-and-mouth . #% We are being misled at the moment on the whole question of the size of the budget . #% We have also made additions to the list of high-risk groups to include the young , the elderly , disabled people and women . #% Likewise , planning policies must help , not impede , progress . #% The women were from 22 different Arab countries . #% The first step in the current peace process was taken when Israel and Egypt concluded the Camp David peace treaty in 1979 . #% If there has been a change in attitude I will undertake to communicate the concerns of Parliament to the Swiss authorities . #% I have attempted to produce balanced legislation that takes account of the needs of all sectors of the industry , not just one vocal sector that is against this directive . #% We want an explanation about Chernobyl . #% For example , certain fish stocks , EU experts told us , would become extinct in the Irish Sea unless their proposals were carried through . #% To succeed as the most progressive combination of States , we must ensure that our institutions are fully democratic and accountable and that the individual and collective rights of all are guaranteed and defended . #% These proposals are very welcome indeed because they attempt to establish an integrated approach to water management and protection , which are very important . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their tremendous work in this area and , even if I do not agree with a lot of what they did and their final conclusions , I do appreciate their diligence and their efforts to try and find compromises where it was possible . #% in writing . - Parliament has given a strong signal in its resolution on the EU-Canada trade negotiations that it will rigorously defend its legislation to ban seal products from the EU market . #% In Britain and in Ireland we have a different legal system - the old common law system - to that which pertains in the majority of other Member States . #% To even suggest that amends might be made through such summary justice indicates what few lessons , if any , have been learnt by the IRA over the past 30 years . #% This has come up over and over again and it is about time action was taken . #% It does not give us the right to harvest forests in Finland or Sweden . #% I think some of the ideas your Presidency is putting forward on research and development will yield dividends for us . #% Inaccurate and uncontrolled declarations are useless and bring the whole system into disrepute . #% No data are available on the state of landfill waste containing large amounts of PVC . #% On the serious matter of falsifying records , the UK average fine was EUR 132 000 while in Germany it was a derisory EUR 98 -- but EUR 98 more than in the Republic of Ireland which , according to those official Commission figures , had no penalties to declare in 2003 , although it belatedly admitted that it had 103 serious infringements ! #% We must be realistic about one particular situation . #% Financial resources must be made available to ensure that the relief programmes continue and that appropriate medicinal and food supplies reach the refugees in need . #% This initiative contains several suggestions to the Commission that would help deal with the problems that countries throughout Europe will face in the coming decades . #% It is a question of power and how power is abused . #% We would like to have codecision , we would like to propose our own performance reserve , but that is not our job . #% I hope that the Members of this Parliament will not be swayed by this simplistic rubbish . #% The same applies to Ireland : it could make a lot more exporting meat than live animals . #% His statement is totally irrelevant to the true situation that emerged . #% It is important that we have the framework proposal to put in place uniform systems for the full certification of food supplements . #% I am also pleased that the President-in-Office has recognised that the engine of growth in the economy are the SMEs providing 70 % of the jobs . #% The General Affairs Council , as Mr Poos says , must remain a powerful political body and it must not be allowed to become a super Coreper . #% There is nothing they do not want to know but there has to be a limit put by society on that curiosity . #% We are dealing with this matter as part of a general concern for the welfare of consumers against a background of recent scares related to food and animal feeds . #% There is an old saying : give a man a fish , you feed him for a day ; teach a man to fish , you feed him for life . #% Whether one looked at telecoms , post office services , water supplies and so on , there was this idea of universality . #% I would like to highlight the scandal of the complete disregard of energy efficiency by the authorities concerned with building European Union establishments . #% There is no doubt about any of that , but there is much room to doubt the worth of the Commission 's response . #% The fact is these rules were dismantled by the Commission last year . #% Maybe the Council should now look again at some of its own decisions , particularly with regard to areas like duty-free and other decisions to exempt those areas from attacks of this kind . #% Over the years , funds that flowed from the cohesion and structural funds and were intended for regions such as mine were channelled to Dublin , the east and the south of the country and co-financed national development plans . #% The United States , as a free market capitalist society , is very keen on intervention to help its industries . #% I also believe that the EU must implement the recommendations of the European Employment Task Force . #% As mentioned in his report , Ireland has been extremely active and successful in broadening access to hedge funds . #% There are two parts to my supplementary question . #% However , in Northern Ireland there is a feeling that neither the United Kingdom Government nor the European Union are looking at it favourably , as compared with other languages . #% It is essential that this legislation makes it mandatory for local authorities and the authorities of the Member States to adhere to a minimum distance . #% Thus , harmonisation of tax would rob Member States of the right to adjust their tax regimes to suit their own needs and would bestow across Europe yet another stultifying one-size-fits-all suppression of national initiative . #% Gender equality is not only a matter of justice but also an imperative for social and economic development . #% 
I know things must change and I know we have to be prepared for that change , but it has to be for the better . #% Some time ago we debated about giving the rights to artists who sell their artwork . #% Mr President , on behalf of Mrs Theorin , who initiated this resolution , and my Group I would ask all Members to support it . #% in writing . - The issue voted on refers to the need of the European Institutions to repeal Council Acts which have , through the passage of time and the development of technology , become obsolete and irrelevant to the correct functioning of the Union . #% We must not forget that the money and the profits that are being made by these companies are coming back into Europe . #% The problem with Nice is how much more was left to be done . #% We have made a good few improvements : we have stronger rules for residue and we have better definitions of good agricultural practices . #% Europe needs this constitution , which would make the Union more democratic , more socially engaged and more comprehensible to its citizens and would enable us to play a more positive role on the world stage . #% The proposal to effectively freeze the size of the European Union budget to 1.27 % of the European GDP means that there will have to be a cut in real terms in the size of the structural funds package available to encourage economic growth in the less developed regions of the present 15 Member States . #% Our demands have been met and now it is our duty to see the Commission pledges and rhetoric translated into action . #% Perhaps if Mrs Jackson comes in there will be time for her to ask a supplementary because the two are on the same issue . #% It is clear that a voluntary approach to guarantee rights for people with disabilities is not working . #% 61 % of adults visit their local Bring Centre at least once a month , as opposed to only 25 % in 1998 . #% Mr President , congratulations are in order today of course to Mrs Read on her excellent report and to Commissioner Liikanen . #% In fact , a lot of positive things have come out of the European Council meeting that we should be promoting very strongly , in particular the commitments given to increasing employment opportunities and increasing the amount of money to be put into research and development ; assisting in the expansion of the lifelong learning and education and training programmes ; utilising the resources available to the European Investment Bank to kick start small and medium-sized enterprises , to give them an opportunity to create the jobs and to create the economic wealth and growth which is necessary within the European Union . #% I would like to speak on behalf of the non-federalists in our group who actually feel that Europe is centralising far too much and more and more powers are being taken away from people at local and national levels , basically without any proper democratic control . #% In that regard , with the Council and the Commission present , I wish to make a number of political points . #% Otherwise , we find out the bad news when it is too late . #% It is extremely important and it is very important to support the attempts of NAFO to halt this very problematic activity of non-contracting parties . #% I also find it quite alarming that this treaty basically endorses the whole concept of a European constitution which is something that has not been debated in the national parliaments . #% I believe that market liberalisation means there is practically no future for nuclear power without a huge change in the ability of states to promote it . #% My few words are in regard to the De Luca report on the policy on tourism within the Union . #% Parliament should reject the Commission proposal for a Council decision and the conclusion of the Agreement in protest at Israel 's contempt for world opinion and international law , and its failure to engage constructively with elected Palestinian leaders in efforts to bring peace to the region . #% I welcome the tone and content of the Commissioner 's contribution here today , but there is a lot of work to be done and I hope we will soon get down to doing it . #% It is , therefore , essential to secure an efficient and effective taxation system and efficient and effective social insurance system . #% Farmers throughout Europe see the European Union as being responsible for agriculture . #% For example , instead of having to collect an E111 form before travelling , and then having to go through various bureaucratic procedures before receiving care , they will , through the card , have immediate access to the care they need . #% I am very concerned at the attendance and surprised that there has been so little participation in this House by our British colleagues during this whole debate on the Irish presidency . #% An on-call official veterinarian must be informed about the route prior to the departure of any horse transported in dedicated transport in an outbreak . #% When we come to growth , job creation and sustainable jobs , then cost efficiency , high quality and accessible traded public services are at the core of that enterprise . #% The statement last night was that this was a victory of good over evil and that Saddam Hussein was good and the rest of the world was evil . #% The Irish Government has already expressed its sentiments in this regard and will be taking appropriate action . #% As Members of this Parliament we fly as part of our work ; we are constantly in the air . #% Savings can , and should , be made by limiting the expenses and wages of MEPs , for instance by linking the daily allowance to vouched-for expenses . #% We need to help to ensure that these cultural and artistic trades are encouraged and made available to a wider audience . #% This regulation replaced 894/97 with the exception of Articles 11 , 19 and 20 which related to driftnets and which were dealt with separately . #% The resolution before us today calls for renewal of EU measures when they expire on 20 February and the introduction of tough new sanctions . #% Mr Parish ' s report is very timely , and the study on `` The Future of Young Farmers in the European Union '' by independent consultants which was commissioned at his request at the beginning of last year provides a much-needed focus on the whole issue . #% As for agriculture , we know that this is an industry which needs all the help it can get in both parts of Ireland . #% In Ireland at the present time there are 14 000 apprentices of which about 11 400 are in the new system of standard-based apprenticeship and roughly 2 600 in the old system which was time-based . #% We have not succeeded in establishing a socially just situation . #% That makes it different from produce coming out of Israeli settlements - and that is a very real difference . #% There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this . #% The list of neglected diseases continues . #% Perhaps there is now a necessity for closer cooperation and coordination concerning these matters . #% In that opinion , it states that your role will be confined to what is set out in the Treaty on the European Union and also on the decisions taken at the European Council meeting in Cologne . #% Many factors , however , can contribute to a commercial decision to relocate a plant . #% I condemn that duplicity , I condemn that hypocrisy but most of all I call on the Dublin Government to end the shame and to return these fugitives forthwith . #% If I had had the opportunity yesterday to put these questions , I would have done so . #% I also strongly hold that national standards and legislation must not be overridden or diluted by EU activities , including EU-funded research . #% Mr President , firstly I welcome the opportunity of congratulating the United Kingdom presidency on its success on behalf of all of us in the European Union . #% My own group has studied with great interest the work of the European Monetary Institute . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her report , and also Mr Kofoed and Mr Kindermann . #% Madam President , now that the dust has finally settled on this directive - possibly the most lobbied directive in my experience here in the last 13 years in Parliament - let us look at some of the issues that concerned not just us here in Parliament but specifically those who were quite bemused by the complexity of this directive in terms of public perception . #% We all know the target we must reach to comply with the provisions of the Kyoto Accord and reduce the excessive use of greenhouse gases , which only result in a depletion of the ozone layer . #% I also hope he will encourage all the Member States to honour and sign the various international conventions which remain unsigned by some Member States - conventions , for example , on money-laundering , on the internationalization of organized crime and , of course , on cooperation between the police forces within the Community . #% The budget must match our ambitions . #% Therefore I join with other colleagues in appealing to all Member States not only to comply with their own constitutional obligations , but actually to put this forward to a referendum of the people within the Member States to give it the kind of endorsement and approval that it requires . #% EU funds have been used to finance health clinics and primary schools , the clearance of landmines , the return of key public service workers , the creation of jobs to combat the opium production that is spiralling in post-Taliban Afghanistan , the rebuilding of infrastructures , clean-up operations in 7 cities and support for the return of the 1.8 million or so refugees returning to the country . #% The forces there can not responsibly administer day-to-day activities in the country . #% From an Irish perspective , I strongly believe that Member State governments must have a veto over tax changes at EU level . #% The discussions that will take place on 4 October will be the next phase of these important negotiations . #% Moreover , armed belligerents in Burundi continue to recruit , at times forcibly , child combatants . #% The Council has continued and I believe intensified a growing tendency , exhibited also at Cardiff , to carry forward innumerable key issues for future presidencies . #% The partnership approach involving all European governments and all EU institutions in the formulation of key European Union policies must always be preserved . #% Perhaps you will take those on board in items 2 and 3 of the motion . #% 
This report demands a change in global governance and in the EU in order to better implement worker 's rights and working conditions , calling for the strengthening of the core labour standards which are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour . #% There are a number of paragraphs I have doubts about - 14 , 15 and 16 for example , regarding the legal basis and whether it is necessary to involve both national and European responsibility to resolve problems of fraud that affect national states more than they do the European Union . #% One of the excuses the minister has given is that there is a dip in the roads and the types of buses available in London would not possibly be suitable . #% In particular , I would refer to the inclusion of a positive list of allowed nutritional health claims . #% So our aim is multi-faceted , we need a better deal for agriculture in developing countries , but we also need to strengthen targeted support for certain aspects of European agriculture . #% The question of sanctions and whether they are criminal or administrative is very important . #% Further to this progress , the Commission should be mandated to negotiate accession to the protocols supplementing the ECHR which concern rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% For many years landfill was seen as the easiest and least expensive option . #% The statistic this amendment presents on the main cause of death is inaccurate . #% Unlike the last speaker I would like to congratulate you , Commissioner , on your threat to cut off European funding . #% The Nitrates Directive has been mentioned . #% Now doctors - and , of course , nurses as well , I must make a point for them too - are expected to be highly technologically proficient . #% I am not going to repeat all Green objections - you have heard them before . #% We have contributed to the chaos in Palestine and we have allowed the Israelis to go too far in the name of their legitimate right to protect their security . #% The real pressure must be applied at home where the people who permitted and tolerated these actions will feel it . #% The reason I underline this point is that the role of the Irish navy is not an Irish one ; it is undertaking a European task . #% Milk prices have plummeted to 14.5 pence per litre , a loss of 4 pence per litre for all milk producers . #% Let us be sure that technologically we are able to replace with a safer product , as far as the environment is concerned , what we are about to ban . #% It is also essential that citizens have the right of redress and that they are not kept in the dark as to proposals relating to their property , either when they are buying property or when they are in possession of it . #% This is simply a matter of best practice in industrial policy and the correct management of public finances . #% The Burmese military junta can not use its ongoing conflict with the rebels of the Karen National Union as an excuse for attacks on civilians . #% We must have quality control and the size of fish caught must be closely monitored . #% Due to the very technical nature of the European Parliament 's investigations into this issue , this Committee of Inquiry is going to take a lot more time to complete its work . #% In this regard I would urge him to exert some pressure on the Council to come to a final decision as to the location of the all-important Food Safety Authority . #% The beef crisis has diverted attention away from fighting unemployment and international crime . #% I urge colleagues to support this proposal . #% In my own country fluorosis is becoming an increasing dental problem , particularly in teenagers . #% I welcome the Commission 's initiative in this area . #% We in this Parliament support your efforts to restore credibility to the peace process and indeed to the political process . #% In Zambia 25 % of teachers have died of AIDS . #% I know there are concerns and I have listened to those concerns . #% I would like to place on record that at all times this Parliament and its Members were extended every courtesy and assistance at political and official level . #% It is an ambitious , difficult task . #% I find it very difficult to get the attention of the Chair . #% The lesson of Bosnia-Herzegovina has not been learnt . #% We also need to focus on the development of substitute fuels and alternative technologies . #% He said he believes it is lagging behind - that real progress must be made in the year 2002 , because fisheries are established in areas where there is no alternative source of employment . #% If ever there was an example of bureaucracy at European level , this surely is it . #% It is known that countries like Australia , Brazil and others want full liberalisation in this sector . #% My group , the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , and I will be giving our full support to Mr Barroso 's nomination and we hope other Members will do so well . #% If laws regulating consumer transactions were harmonised throughout the EU , small and medium businesses ( SMEs ) and consumers in all Member States would benefit . #% The number of people who have taken part in the Erasmus programme since its inception will exceed one million during the academic year 2002 to 2003 . #% I do not understand what has happened . #% There are derisory fines which are no deterrent to any continuation of these kinds of offences . #% I believe that the lack of cohesion in the regional application of the CFP must inevitably lead to a lack of confidence in the policy and in the Community institutions . #% I am delighted that the Irish presidency has already embarked on an intensive programme of consultations with fellow Member State governments during the first working week of its presidency . #% They have raised their case in Belfast , Dublin , Washington DC and now in the European Parliament . #% I realise that this execution is not the wish of the Nigerian Government . #% At present , under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome , decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity . #% May I first of all acknowledge the value and potential of Socrates and in so doing thank the rapporteur for her work . #% Completion of the internal market in electricity and gas is something which will impact on each and every one of the 370 million consumers right across the European Union . #% You may say that it is not possible , but I think you could at least give a rough estimate . #% The people whom I represent in this House were sadly disappointed and very angry at the attitude the government headed by the President-in-Office has shown to the fishing industry . #% It is with great pleasure that I commend this resolution to the House . #% in writing . - I support this resolution on the proposed International Labour Organisation convention on domestic workers . #% Mr President , in view of the complete blockade in British ports for Irish beef , could I ask the Commission to make a statement to say what they intend to do about this very serious and deteriorating situation , which is an interruption of trade . #% Alongside the proposed technical improvements , I particularly welcome measures to improve the safety of persons with reduced mobility . #% I thought the Commission was going to come down hard on this whole issue . #% While food production , using the European model and food security , are of paramount importance , this should not sideline the contribution of rural development . #% Five years is far too short a period . #% We will not have the entire picture until the relevant daughter directives are in place over the next few years . #% I encourage other Member States to follow suit . #% I urge the Commission to take particular interest and to evaluate the availability of veterinary resources for future disease management within the EU generally . #% Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive . #% The document tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs should have confined itself to a simple recommendation to vote for or against the Amsterdam Treaty . #% We have committed ourselves to fully eliminating the customs duties applied to the export of the world 's 48 poorest countries . #% 
I should like to ask for clarification on the question of the amount of money to be allocated this year . #% Only peaceful negotiations carried out in an atmosphere of mutual respect will bring about progress . #% In conclusion , I believe we all support the intensification of talks between the European Union governments so as to ensure that agreement can be reached concerning the provisions of the treaty . #% The Spanish authorities should therefore learn from the experience in Northern Ireland . #% The point I would like to ask the Commissioner to consider particularly is the fact that the only test provided for in the EU and under Irish legislation is the single intradermal comparative test as specified in Directive 64/432 of the EC . #% The Commissioner mentioned three important points , one of which is access to third countries . #% We have to look at the societal implications of ICT , the environmental benefits that can come from it with things like less travelling to work . #% We want to have a deal that has everyone on board but not at any price . #% I support the Commission 's proposals for regulation on this issue and believe , broadly-speaking , that it is a good thing . #% An IRA unit , led by the volunteer who had fetched and then disposed of the knife , then coordinated a clean-up operation to destroy forensic and real evidence , including the CCTV footage . #% We must be able to confiscate the financial proceeds of terrorism so as to help cut off the money supply which is the financial oxygen for its evil operations . #% According to the Commission 's Green Paper , no full assessment of the risks connected with the use of lead-based products - which include PVC stabilisers - has been completed . #% We now have another dictator in Mugabe : not content with the purge of white farmers , he has now turned on the black population , who have been uprooted from the land and are living in hovels with no food . #% However , it must also be acknowledged that the harsh Russian winter is not far away and we must therefore prepare for it . #% We have seen the damage that can be wreaked from a more lax approach . #% In the Constitutional Affairs Committee , I have observed at first hand the strategy and scheming of arch Europhiles . #% However , the Commission must ensure that there is coherence in EU industrial policy and that the EU budget is not used to increase shareholder value in some companies , while EU workers pay a price . #% We really should take account of animal welfare . #% The financial services industry is a global industry and our efforts must remain on securing a transaction tax that is effective and workable on a global level . #% Parliament 's procedures do not allow it to make rapid decisions , but there are suggestions tabled by MEPs that perhaps the European Council could find helpful . #% Allergy sufferers in particular stand to gain from this proposal , as fur is potentially hazardous to their health and without proper labelling , they may buy a product containing these textiles without realising it . #% For 90 % of the people , the European Union does not represent a positive image of relevance to them . #% The same thing happened four years ago , which is why I protested in committee . #% Firstly , it should be stressed that the Patents Directive is not proposing the introduction of a new patents system into the EU , but instead harmonising and bringing consistency to patent offices throughout different Member States . #% We must appeal to the better instincts of our peoples , to bear in mind that what we are trying to create is a Europe based on human values . #% He must be forced to observe the Dayton Peace Agreement and international law in practice as well as in theory . #% This crisis is having devastating consequences on world trade , but the demand of the United Nations financial summit last year , for example , that the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations is the answer , is utterly wrong . #% It is a sad fact that the Dublin Foundation has found that over 15 million people have reported violence , sexual harassment or bullying in the workplace . #% Finally , on the macro policy mix conducive to growth , employment and convergence , the Commission correctly referred to Article 105 ( 1 ) and let me quote it briefly : ' Monetary policy shall support the general economic policies of the European Union , including those concerning a high level of employment ' . #% If we proceed with ` one size fits all ' legislation which ignores the particularities of individual countries or regions , we risk alienating our citizens . #% It allows us to recruit the new generation of scientists and technologists . #% I am disappointed that there appears to be a dispute between two Commission DGs as to who should fund this programme in the future . #% The framework programme for additional funds to research geological disposal of radioactive waste means that EU-funded research for what is effectively a commercial waste problem represents yet another subsidy to the nuclear industry . #% in writing . - I do not support paragraph 29 as it calls for the introduction of CCCTB . #% Mr President , I would like to say that I believe that both Parliament and the Commission are most fortunate in having somebody of the calibre of Mr Poos to give us this very fine report which is long overdue . #% In 1997 the common agriculture policy was worth # 5.1 billion to the Irish economy . #% I should like to say to both Mr Solana and Mr Patten that there is an enormous challenge to bring greater political coherence to this task . #% Success will come when we realise that the UN is an ideal that needs to be fostered and that we need an efficient organisation that can serve these ideals . #% Northern Ireland is demonstrably ungoverned and may be ungovernable under the present structures . #% In effect , are we not really trading jobs and emissions ... #% Already last October , the government of North Korea was reportedly running a secret uranium enrichment programme in blatant violation of the KEDO Agreement . #% Bringing about this change has taken -- and will continue to take -- time , effort and investment , a fact that is reflected in the 2011-2012 timetable set in the revised packaging directive for Greece , Portugal and Ireland . #% But , most importantly of all , it must be seen as a move towards guaranteeing better public services for all people . #% We need to be careful as to how we deal with comments concerning food . #% I welcome the Commissioner to the House also , because eventually the Commission will have to start implementing some of the things that we are talking about here . #% There is a necessity and an urgency with regard to ensuring that those people who make investments in the tourism product and the tourism area are given the necessary back-up marketing and structural supports from the European Union programmes , which are sometimes denied them because they have already made capital investments themselves . #% Nothing can excuse the widespread violence and intimidation of the last 10 days . #% The Commission should hold its line and if Ecofin and the Commission hold that line we will whole-heartedly support them . #% Mr President , my compliments to Mr Andria for this report on the Commission communication to Parliament and the Council dealing with policy issues and the future challenges of clearing and settlement in the European Union , the process through which transfer of ownership takes place in a securities market . #% The supplementary question that I want to put is this : would the Minister agree with me that it is an abstract term and that it refers to the knitting together in an interdependent way of the economies of the European Economic Union , so that it becomes very difficult for countries to withdraw , while at the same time recognizing that it is a voluntary organization and whoever wants to leave can do so ? #% There is now a new reason for hastening slowly on enlargement . #% Why did you not tell it last March ? #% Only the tonnage specified on the official prescription should be manufactured . #% I strongly believe that efforts to isolate President Arafat will only exasperate tensions within the Palestinian leadership . #% I will explain as carefully as I can . #% A strong and unanimous approach by the Development Committee , supported by three other committees , has seen some sense prevail . #% I compliment the many voluntary participants and , in particular , the teachers without whose involvement the programmes could not succeed . #% Progress on giving real credibility to food and consumer policy has been substantial in the past twelve months . #% With regard to derivatives , I support the timely call for the Commission to present a report on their role on the capital markets . #% The agricultural community is aware that change is on the way with this new agreement , and is currently poised to embrace it . #% In particular , let us ensure that we can do this collectively for the betterment of all mankind . #% We will have to supervent Hilal and those like him . #% But it is easy to see that the arms industry as a whole is pushing the policy . #% It should not be forgotten that the United Nations fulfilled a similar role in East Timor in 1999 . #% We need to ensure that all employment policies are people-centred , not merely a response to an urgent need in one or other Member State . #% The international press treated the conference with a certain amount of cynicism ; some called it a fiasco . #% 
in writing . - I voted in favour of this resolution as it underlines the horrific circumstances that the vast majority of the Palestinian population in Gaza live in today and , in particular , calls for the ` immediate ' and ` unconditional ' opening of all Gaza 's borders . #% Has the Commission no shame in trying to ride to success in the referendum campaign on the back of emotion and sentiment , such as the Commissioner deployed in her speech at the commemoration ceremony for the liberation of the concentration camp of Terezin at the weekend ? #% Thus , we need to balance animal welfare requirements in the EU with ensuring a viable industry survives . #% At the COP 11/MOP 1 meeting in Montreal next month , the focus will be on post-Kyoto and on what happens beyond 2012 . #% There are practices with regard to medical devices and new technologies which are in use in one Member State and are not even discussed in another . #% The fact that an agreement was struck between Parliament and the Council is , in no small measure , due to the unstinting efforts of the rapporteur , who made every effort to keep all the political groups on side and who vigorously defended the views of Parliament with the other institutions . #% It is our duty as one human being to another , but what we must absolutely insist on in all our immigration policies , not just in the context of mass displacements of people in the event of civil war , is that we must have a much better thought-out , much more humane and generous , and , above all , merciful policy towards those who come to us for help in these tragic situations . #% It is also accepted that countries and industries which innovate more quickly will end up being more competitive than those which delay . #% Although we have no control over droughts in Australia or severe weather conditions that affect the grain harvest in Russia , I do believe that Europe urgently needs to tackle its lack of self-sufficiency regarding protein crops . #% We have recently had a very significant success concerning a French mother and a German father . #% I will confine my remarks to the Dublin Foundation . #% I would name Finland , Sweden and countries like the Republic of Ireland , which have made good progress . #% However , the word is empty without the reality . #% It is also important to recognise that Gama is currently in the process of seeking to dismiss the workers who blew the whistle on this scam . #% The Association of European Airlines has gone so far as to intimate that a certain sense of complacency exists in some governments , particularly the British Government , about seriously tackling the problem of air congestion . #% We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted , doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs . #% I note that the Spanish Presidency took the initiative to organise a special Informal Council of Tourism Ministers . #% The local papers blamed the European Union . #% Unfortunately , that seems to be too often the case . #% The question is : Why did the Council of Ministers not follow with the same alacrity ? #% This declaration is one of the most significant signs that I have seen , as a Parliamentarian , that our demands can influence the direction of the European Council . #% I know the Commissioner is aware of this . #% You claim to be democrats , but you enslave the working people of Europe to the markets , the financial markets , which lead you around by the nose . #% But we would like the statement of assurance of the Court of Auditors in relation to the revenue side of the budget and administration to be clearer . #% We can call them unionists or nationalists . #% Aquaculture is a natural resource-based industry which is anything but dangerous . #% In all , the current legislation encourages a reduction in emissions of 25 fluorinated gases -- hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride -- through containment , responsible use , recovery , destruction and disposal . #% If we can give people jobs this will prove to be the greatest weapon in the fight against social exclusion . #% I wish also to state that I speak this evening on behalf of Mr Niall Andrews who wanted to speak on this subject but had to return to Dublin unexpectedly . #% Finally , I agree entirely with Mr von Wogau . #% We have to remember that there is no such thing as a safe country for certain people . #% In a resolution on the renewed Social Agenda approved by the last European Parliament in May of this year , again we state that we consider that strengthening of the implementation and enforcement of existing labour law under national and community law and under ILO conventions must be a priority for EU institutions and Member States . #% I fear , however , that what we are getting is not that . #% The revision of this agreement must be consistent with the needs of the new world we live in and must be based on a partnership of equals . #% To return to the issue for farmers , their concern , in particular with the new single farm payment regime , is to receive prompt payment of what they now call the ` cheque in the post ' , to have it delivered on time and within their production year , because it comprises such a huge proportion of their farm income . #% Mr President , I address my remarks to the Stevenson report only . #% The provisions of Nice are part and parcel of the ground rules on which the candidate countries are negotiating their membership of the Union . #% I welcome the pioneering decision to introduce a phased ban on fluorinated gases with a global warming potential of more than 150 times the potency of carbon dioxide in motor vehicles . #% As of now , it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos . #% I was the butt of - as Mrs Pollack has said - some of the most ferocious lobbying ever seen in this Parliament . #% It was long overdue , but now that it has happened , it is hugely welcome . #% Here I would urge support for the establishment of a binding legal instrument laying down minimum guarantees as regards income , social protection , medical treatment and housing , and particular attention must be devoted to the needs of elderly people . #% I know there is debate in the scientific community as to whether the models used by the IPCC stand up , and that debate will continue , but the majority of people accept the IPCC modelling and the projections arising from it . #% Beware of the various menus on decoupling ! #% I hope that their ordeal will soon have a relieving and positive conclusion . #% Furthermore , it is no secret that countries such as Iraq and North Korea have made attempts to obtain bomb-building capacity . #% Madam President , given the degree to which the media has had access to an unpublished report commissioned by the EU 's Scientific and Technological Option Assessment Committee , STOA , entitled `` The Possible Toxic Effects from Nuclear Reprocessing Plants at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague '' , could you immediately organise for the publication of this report to ensure a balanced and informed comment by all , especially by us in this Parliament of democratically elected representatives ? #% Despite the viciousness of his accusations he has never once provided with this list -- strange justice indeed . #% The key priorities for the European Union at this time include : the completion of the Financial Services Action Plan so as to guarantee a greater level of competition amongst the financial institutions operating within the 25 Member States of the EU , which includes ensuring that retail banking services are available to all EU citizens in the 25 Member States ; facilitating the merging of European banks and the updating of asset management legislation so as to guarantee that fund managers can operate asset funds on a cross-border basis ; the introduction of new legislation to reduce the costs of clearing and settling trading security transactions ; and the introduction of greater competition in the insurance sector . #% I would like to mention that the last toxic chemical , fluorosilic acid , which is used to fluoridate water supplies in my country , has the invidious effect of making other toxic substances , such as lead , mercury and aluminium , exponentially more dangerous . #% I presume the planes will not be able to get here either . #% I congratulate Mr Sterckx for producing an excellent report and I would urge Members of this House to support it enthusiastically . #% There is now perhaps an opportunity for us to re-engage with the elected representatives of the Palestinian people -- Hamas , with the Lebanese Government , with Israel and with the Governments of Syria and Iran to try to come forward with a deal . #% To use a slang word it is a ` cop-out ' to say that it is not a matter for the Council . #% Finally , it is my view that it is regrettable that the European Commission has again come under attack in the context of the European Summit . #% The Committee on Development and Cooperation and myself have time and time again warned ECHO and the Commission that something should be done about this . #% I would like to ask the Commission to investigate -- or maybe it has already done this -- whether the transportation and treatment of these ships is in breach of Natura 2000 legislation . #% With regard to the question of whether an institutional agreement or an article in a proposed treaty or Constitution is the best place for this , I personally have not made up my mind on that point . #% I acknowledge that last October they ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination on all Forms of Discrimination against Women . #% The observers from the United States and Australia all concluded that there was no evidence against the men . #% A number of the ideas raised and the suggestions put forward in the Commission study will have serious implications for Irish farmers and the Irish agricultural sector . #% The current negotiations on a revision of the European Treaties are taking place in parallel with the preparation of the creation of a single currency . #% The debate has centred on statements of personal preference proposing/opposing the argument , using the Netherlands and Finland as case examples . #% The Commission 's proposal is a sensible one , particularly from an environmental perspective , since taxes levied on motorists would be linked to carbon dioxide emissions from the vehicle . #% The previous speaker is right , jobs may be jeopardized , including jobs in other shipyards if we do not give due reflection to the knock-on implications . #% As I said , we who come from Ireland know the benefits that can accrue for the people of the Middle East if courage and leadership are shown by the people there . #% 
The title of the report is very broad-ranging and the report itself correspondingly deals with very many issues and very many countries . #% An Alzheimer 's action programme would be of enormous benefit to the many thousands of Europeans suffering from this disease . #% We are all looking forward to ten countries acceding to the Union on 1 May 2004 . #% It remains perhaps one of the most intractable problems facing all of us . #% The EU must take the lead in the UN and must pursue these goals through EU development cooperation . #% The report seeks to ensure that funding is increased at least in line with inflation for critical social policy expenditure at this time of rising unemployment . #% All the calls this House has made for universal services of general interest to the citizens of Europe to be guaranteed as a matter of urgency have been ignored , although this is a key part of European citizenship and of the social model we are so proud of in Europe . #% I am sorry to say that , but that is the case . #% In the wake of the accounting scandal surrounding Italian food group Parmalat , which erupted in December 2003 with the revelation of a black hole of EUR 4 billion in lost funds and EUR 14 billion in unpaid debt , I believe we certainly need the Commission to set up a revised directive on corporate governance that could strengthen rules on auditing . #% As to Member States leaving the Commission to do the dirty work , I hope that does not refer to the work of enlargement . #% Madam President , I do not support the integration of the two directives - namely on municipal waste , waste oil , solvents and clinical waste , as well as other non-hazardous waste - into one composite European piece of legislation . #% Let us vote on the issue before us and not mix up other issues with it . #% I understand that blood transfusion stocks are now almost non-existent . #% The veil of secrecy on abuse is now lifting and no country can take pride in what all too often children have been subjected to . #% Along with most colleagues , I welcome the fact that a series of reforms under the current and past Commissioners have brought agricultural expenditure under control . #% Of course , it has happened time and time again and we must do something to try and control this . #% In that sense I welcome the statement of the Commission , although I am concerned about the comments of the Council . #% It is clear that piracy has now reached epidemic proportions in Europe and poses severe risks to consumer health and safety , with fake toys , medicines and spare parts coming into the EU . #% Having left my house at 7 a.m. this morning I expected to be in Strasbourg at 4 p.m. #% What is going on is unacceptable . #% Alzheimer 's disease represents 50 % of these cases . #% We had group meetings ; I was watching the screen and you jumped from Question 41 to 49 . #% It is only the burden of proof -- on the Commission under Article 175 , on the Member State under Article 95 -- and the enforcement procedures which are different . #% The President of the Commission pointed out that the parts of the structural funds not being spent are an embarrassment since we need greater investment to create more employment . #% . Mr President , I would simply like to point out that my report is the last report from the Committee on Fisheries to this House during the present mandate . #% We want to ensure that we remain a popular location for outside investors , who view Ireland as a gateway to the single market within the European Union . #% It is the definitive view of our group , and has been consistently the case , that the amendment of this article would be a form of Trojan horse . #% We must insist that the Israeli siege of Gaza and the appalling human suffering that it is causing for the 1.5 million inhabitants should be lifted immediately and without preconditions . #% I have just left the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , where I made the point that we were proceeding with indecent haste in relation to meeting those deadlines . #% Indeed , I agree with the suggestion in the report that other pollutant emissions should be part of the equation , although it might be difficult to include this measure initially . #% I refuse to accept that neighbourhoods that exist on a social or economic margin should be of no concern whatsoever to Europe . #% I am unable to support a series of amendments that seek to go further than is necessary . #% No-one has agreed to an oral amendment of any sort . #% Mr President , there are two things that are giving rise to fear at the moment : the absence of a vaccine for the virus that has been found and a fear that the authorities , both national and European , are not properly geared for dealing with a virus which knows no boundaries . #% I would like that corrected . #% The special programme for peace and reconciliation and the International Fund for Ireland have done outstanding work in giving great hope to our young people . #% The wars in the Balkans in recent years have been conveniently forgotten when fiery advocates of an almighty Europe tell us the new Europe has prevented and stopped wars . #% It also accepted the definition of a passenger . #% In today 's economic climate there is a growing need for detailed analysis of the effects of recession and other financial shocks on national economies and the EU . #% Tourism is one of the fastest-growing industries in the European Union . #% Though I note that the Commission had second thoughts , I feel we must hold it to its word . #% I received a lot of lobbying on this issue , and mush attention was devoted to it . #% Recently , it was revealed that , over a period of eight months from August 2004 to April 2005 , 83 000 litres of radioactive material containing 20 tonnes of uranium and plutonium leaked unnoticed from a broken pipe into a containment tank . #% Mr President , I would like to raise an issue about what happens to a non-national worker . #% Unfortunately , they have not had an opportunity to contribute to the resolution before the House today . #% To conclude , there really is a need for some joined-up thinking in this area . #% I would agree totally with the previous speaker , that the vast majority of people in the agricultural industry , be they in the manufacturing side , the factory side or indeed at the farm level , are not involved in fraud . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their work , in spite of the criticism . #% I would urge international donors to continue to make sufficient funds available to permit the running of the camps during the negotiation and the verification process . #% Let us give credit where credit is due : Mr Barroso has moved , he has brought forward new initiatives and new policies . #% Madam President , my Group welcomes some of the changes that have been made in this report insofar as a distinction is now being made between money for fishing rights and money for development . #% We have seen appalling weather incidents this summer which have cost lives and caused devastation right across the world . #% I also want to speak very briefly about driftnets , for their use is dealt with under technical measures . #% We were all horrified recently when BNFL had to bring back nuclear materials from Japan , because it had falsified documents . #% I also endorse the use of qualified majority voting to achieve an effective common foreign and security policy , and the incorporation of the WEU under the European pillar . #% Ireland 's home lies in Europe , both historically and politically . #% At present , Ireland and Malta are the only two countries in EU without a national transplant authority to maximise organ usage . #% This has been my view for some time . #% Are we talking about climate change levies , emission taxes , energy taxes generally , carbon tax , carbon dioxide tax ? #% So I appeal to the Commissioner to avoid the ignominy of being brought before the European Court of Justice by this House for failing to comply with the Treaties . #% I would like to place on record that on this day we reverently honour the Jewish victims of Auschwitz and the other victims , but it should be put in very bold letters that the disabled were there from beginning to end and were killed for no other reason than that they were not perfect , which is what Hitler 's Reich was looking for . #% Often he has contacted Europe Direct with questions only to find that it is the SOLVIT staff that have the technical and legal expertise to answer the questions that the public and his citizens need answered . #% I fundamentally disagree with Mrs Foster 's and her colleagues ' opposition to the idea of a European coastguard . #% The arrest of Mr Milosevic is the first important step in bringing him to justice and the authorities in Belgrade must be congratulated for their determination in this regard . #% While my constituents in Northern Ireland recognised that enlargement would bring with it a financial burden on the richer Member States , they were also keen to ensure that funding is allocated in ways that will bring sustainable improvement throughout the entire European Union . #% We have to be certain that the wrong signals are not sent to the Serbian regime , that it is possible for the Kosovars to return home eventually to safety . #% 
They are showing cowardice and a lack of courage in dealing with this particular issue . #% 2012 also presents particular opportunities for Belfast as it is the centenary of the Titanic -- I might add that we had a ` titanic ' victory last night on the football field over England ! #% Ionising radiation transfers energy at levels that can induce changes in any matter it penetrates and even cause irreversible damage to human cells . #% The UN and the Red Cross should have compulsory access to all prisoners everywhere and the UN should have a daily-updated register of all prisoners in all UN member states . #% I take note of the novel , innovative suggestion of the rapporteur , but I do not support it through the back door . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Evans for her contribution on this subject . #% The citizens of Europe are unfortunately growing older and EU governments are going to have to be innovative to ensure that public and private pension programmes are both supported and protected . #% First , there is a difference between synthetic DHA and DHA in breast milk . #% This must all be put on a database , so that information can be shared by all enforcement officers throughout the EU . #% It would be a victory for the lamentable fearmongering that we constantly hear in this House from Mr Bonde , with his simplistic , opportunistic clichés . #% It also has a role in transposition and implementation . #% We have to stop dangling artificial carrots in front of the applicant states and be honest . #% It declares its supremacy over national constitutions ; it proclaims the subservience of national law ; it appoints its own president and foreign minister . #% It is important for women who have not been in the workforce before to get access to it . #% It is equally important to ensure that similar bi-partisanship exists in its Sri Lankan counterpart . #% The harvesting of egg cells poses serious risks to the health of the women involved , owing to hyper-stimulation of the ovaries . #% As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament . #% I think it is the first report they have done in this Parliament and , I have to say , they have done a very good job , together with staff . #% That reservation arises from the fact that , to date , PEACE Funding in Northern Ireland has been allocated in a most imbalanced way , to the gross disadvantage to the Protestant/Unionist Community . #% The time has come now to countenance a qualitatively different policy response . #% It is about time that they , along with other countries throughout the world , got rid of their nuclear arsenals . #% I particularly welcome the addition of mobility allowance in Annex IIa under Heading G ` Ireland ' , that is , new point ( da ) . #% In relation to the Prestige , responsibility and liability were disputed . #% I want the Commission to ensure that only minimal tariff reductions will be applied to those sensitive sectors . #% Things will not be the same after 11 September , as many others have said . #% However , it is imperative , as also with Hong Kong , to continue monitoring to ensure that there is no erosion of democracy , human rights and freedoms . #% I listened with care to the Commissioner when she gave her reasons as to why she has not brought forward a draft directive under Article 13 of the EC Treaty . #% For these reasons Members of the EPLP have voted against the Fiori report . #% We can not change the rules half-way through the programmes and we must denounce the hypocrisy of the Council of Ministers of paying lip-service to launch actions on unemployment and then reneging on their commitments to tackle unemployment through structural funds . #% It is important that these economic partnership agreements contribute towards placing the ACP countries in a position where they can be progressively integrated into the world economy . #% We want to ensure that they do have a right to grow bananas , in particular in the interests of the many people involved in banana production in those countries . #% There is no need to remind the Commissioner that the beef sector , even before the advent of BSE , was in financial difficulty . #% We must remember that we live in the European Union where the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is in operation . #% The Tenet and Mitchell proposals are still on the table and , together with the recent proposals from the Saudi Arabian government , they too provide a basis for the resumption of peace talks if there is a full compliance with the recent UN resolutions by the Israeli government . #% I want to state clearly on behalf of the ELDR Group that we wish to maintain the order of vote as indicated . #% Mr President , the Portuguese Government claims that the activities on board the ` Women on Waves ' ship violate Portuguese law . #% It is genuinely felt that the European Union has not responded comprehensively and could improve its policy in this area . #% The developments on the uranium enrichment programme led the European Parliament in October last year to freeze the EUR 20 million EU contributions to KEDO for 2003 , and the US administration to stop its oil supplies to North Korea under the KEDO Agreement . #% What made it all the more noteworthy is that the LTTE 's chief spokesman , Mr Tamilchelvan , stated that this interim administration was not a precursor to a separate state . #% However , I do not agree that the retirement age for workers should be raised . #% Leadership is needed on both sides , and that is not easy . #% I do not think it is at all anti-European to make the point that the Olympic Games give great national pride to the nation states that participate in them . #% And if he uses his stubbornness to refuse to dialogue with us , if we have difficulties in the hearings , that is a stubbornness we will oppose . #% However , this is the positive side of things , and we seem to be regressing in other areas . #% Proposals to improve the Capital Requirements Directive are therefore central to creating stable and responsible banks . #% It provides an incentive to service providers to establish themselves in low-wage , low-tax countries , and encourages a race to the bottom in relation to wages and employment conditions . #% We would look ridiculous now if we reverted to a weaker position . #% We expect to be offering to the developing world a bigger and an earlier reduction in all agricultural tariffs and in getting rid of restrictions of imports from the developing world . #% The common position was totally unacceptable from Parliament 's point of view . #% I believe this hypocrisy must stop , and must stop now . #% Today we need more quality and we need to consider the environment . #% The EU continues to do much to combat the rise of Aids and to provide information on preventive health programmes and support for access to anti-viral treatment for all . #% The directive on inter-Community trade in bovine animals is central to the economic survival of livestock farmers , particularly from my own country , Ireland , where we export up to 90 % of our entire livestock production - a very high proportion of which is live exports to continental Europe and beyond . #% Every country should support the telephone helpline for children . #% Madam President , I was not aware of that . #% There is an onus on all Member States , but in particular those who have decided not to take part in EMU from the outset . #% The LRA lay siege to southern Sudanese villages : killing the adults , taking the children . #% With these few comments , I commend the rapporteur 's efforts and I very much welcome the report he has produced . #% The Council 's suggestions have been rejected by everybody directly involved in the industry - in particular by the airlines and the trade unions - and this must tell us something . #% This depleted uranium has been used in Cumbria up to 1995 , and it is believed that as many as 1400 depleted uranium shells have been fired into the Solway Firth , which is an inlet of the Irish Sea . #% My country is one of the ten member states with a vehicle registration tax . #% I want also to recognize the leadership of David Trimble in bringing the majority of the Unionists of Northern Ireland alongside and I want to thank Jim Nicholson , too , a Member of this House also , for giving his considerable assistance and influence in support of David Trimble 's effort . #% in writing . - Over the last number of days , Ireland has been struck by severe flooding causing devastation for ordinary families , for small businesses and for farmers across the island . #% Already in Northern Ireland , a product - Soltron - is in use which has had immediate results in combating poisons emitted . #% There have been 17 000 children born in those camps over the last ten years . #% That is a welcome move . #% 
This directive should be solely directed towards supporting new renewable technologies that are not yet commercially viable . #% This is a motivated abstention rather than an indifferent one . #% I share these concerns and I urge the Hong Kong SAR Government to address them in the final proposals that they bring forward . #% On the other hand , we must put a stop to the insidious branding of the entire fisheries profession with the same brush of dishonesty . #% Finally we also highlight the importance , in all awareness and education campaigns , of the ability to recognise the symptoms of dementia . #% We can not create a Europe that the people will feel is theirs if we simply talk about economics and money all the time . #% Citizens really worry about these issues . #% It was a good thing that the number of farms was reduced and that we had the common agricultural policy to ease that . #% None of our countries can halt these acts on their own . #% . Mr President , I also wish to thank the rapporteurs for undertaking the very difficult task of trying to find some areas of agreement on the Treaty in the very diverse institution and august body that this Parliament is . #% If we are to go along with the presidency 's conclusions then the fifteen employment action plans submitted by the Member States represent a real effort to enhance the employability of young people , the long-term unemployed and women . #% There has been an increasing awareness that modern medicines do not always provide relief for all possible conditions and many people have found herbal medicines to be an important element of their health regime . #% A ban such as that to which I am referring is being introduced in Britain after four years of extensive research and consultation . #% Although these proposals are very necessary and overdue in the context of the hushkits regulation and the US complaint and , indeed , the recent opinion of the Advocate General , the UK Government 's position points out some flaws in the Commission 's approach . #% Low-cost air travel is supported by the citizens of Europe . #% Could the Commissioner tell us where our health services directive is and when we will have a draft proposal ? #% I very much welcome the leadership provided by the new Commissioner , Mr Byrne , and his commitment to the establishment of an EU food safety agency . #% How then is the European family farm model to survive ? #% It must be seen to deliver . #% Even the United States has at least halted new investment . #% We are left with an anachronistic piece of legislation , the Euratom Treaty , as our main legal base for energy . #% One of the most important elements of our work here today , and the vote in favour of the Lynne report , has been that it sends out a clear message , not just from the 15 countries of the European Union but also from the 10 accession countries , that we want to establish common standards and rules . #% It is only now that we are beginning to take action on it . #% . Thank you , Commissioner , for your response . #% We do not make a case here today for the large factory farms . #% I agree with you , Commissioner Lamy , that the agriculture negotiations will be very important in determining whether or not the meetings in Cancun are a success . #% The waves also hit the coasts of Belgium , Britain , France , Ireland and the Netherlands . #% Most importantly , the directive should propose mechanisms for the internalisation of external costs of traditional energy production . #% The Commission 's own group of advisers on the ethical implications of biotechnology , Opinion No 8 , paragraph 2 : ' An invention based on the use of elements of human origin having been retrieved without respecting the principle of consent will not fulfil the ethical requirements . #% My own feeling is that every possible sanction should be imposed on the Algerian Government to ensure that human rights are respected for everyone : men , women and children . #% That clearly is a farce in anyone 's analysis . #% Breaking off the negotiations did not have the same negative impact as it had at the end of 1996 when all fisheries were suspended . #% The Commission services , and ultimately the College of Commissioners , have submitted to Parliament a proposal which , we believe , reflects too many of the priorities of the lobbyists with which they have dealt and too little concern for the wider public interest . #% On the healthcare side , one important development that can take place is the delivery of health services to rural and peripheral areas . #% In one case a mortgage company operating in Ireland since 2005 has already repossessed 30 homes . #% That is the only way to guarantee permanent peace and security in the region . #% I know that great progress has been made there . #% His fiancée , Bridgeen , his children , his family , are caught up in a fight at a time when they should be free to grieve and work towards closure . #% I regret that delay . #% Mr President , my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative , in Ireland in particular , has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area . #% Of course , we need new products and we need new processes and we need new ideas about how our society should be run . #% The Commission should now work with the new Member States and accession countries to assist them in using the European Regional Development Fund and the pre-accession funds to create a comprehensive health care infrastructure . #% It concluded that EMU participation by Ireland would yield a net benefit for the Irish economy in these sectors . #% Statehood properly lies in nation states and that is where it should remain . #% From an Irish point of view it is essential that this funding continue after the year 2000 and up to the year 2006 . #% Ireland in no way supports the use of nuclear energy . #% It happens on a regular basis and we all have an opportunity to make it very clear to the Commission in this debate that we do not accept this . #% To do so would tie the hands of the industry at a time when , for example , my country Ireland , as an agricultural exporting nation , must become increasingly competitive . #% Indeed , such a proposal could even undermine existing consumer rights . #% A few months ago it , along with the US company UNOCAL , signed a new contract with Burmese oil and gas enterprises to expand natural gas explorations in the Andaman Sea . #% The conclusions on unemployment which are outlined in part 3 of the presidency 's document are more an overview of what is being done at present than a new set of initiatives . #% I am confident that by the end of the Irish presidency , in six weeks ' time or so , we will have made significant progress in the whole justice and home affairs area . #% We have allocated over EUR 1 billion for nuclear funding and nowhere near the equivalent for renewable energy . #% We have not yet achieved as much as we should have done for those people . #% In Ireland we are obliged to have a referendum . #% The European institutions and European lawmakers have been given the power by the Member States to make that law . #% There are six hundred million disabled people across the world , 80 % of whom are in the developing world . #% Hospital patients and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to resistant bacteria . #% We can learn how the United States tackles this problem , in relation not only to prevention - it saves some USD 6 billion per year by preventing incidents like this - but to its response when incidents do happen . #% Mr Barón Crespo mentioned the good debate we had yesterday with the High Representative , Javier Solana . #% There is no mention of the fact that British Aerospace , for example , is responsible for arming Indonesia with Hawk jets so it can terrorise the people of East Timor . #% Mr President , it is a very sensitive time to be discussing an issue like this . #% Cosmetics containing any of 26 fragrances above a certain threshold are to be labelled with a warning which says ` could cause an allergic reaction ' . #% Of those 746 vessels , at least 38 were directly exported to known flag of convenience countries . #% At the same time , there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns , after which we will send the bread . #% I still totally disagree with the Council 's position on the last question . #% 
It also fails to set up a mechanism to sort out difficulties and problems arising from a Member State 's refusal to enforce the arrest warrant outside the specific areas that it excludes . #% I would like to know whether this text genuinely reflects Parliament 's views , particularly the amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and whether the Commission would be kind enough to read out that text so that we can see what we are agreeing to vote on . #% But really it is contradictory for the Council on the one hand to be talking about initiatives to create employment and then to go ahead with a policy which will create unemployment to the tune of 140 , 000 job losses . #% There is no reason to assume that the same majority , or more , would not obtain , if the Commissioner had a study and allowed the Ecofin ministers to look at the issue again in a clear and factual way . #% This will only undermine farmers ' confidence in the ability of Europe and its institutions to bring stability to a sector already bedevilled recently by falling income and unstable markets . #% in writing . - Youth on the Move is a fantastic initiative , and I strongly support the group in giving it my full support . #% The future of waste disposal must not and can not lie in the continued search for more landfill up and down the length and breadth of our country . #% The Euratom Treaty makes no provision for the setting or enforcement of safety standards relating to the operation of nuclear installations . #% Of course , there is more work to be done . #% On the question of the so-called golden rule on investment , we can support references to Article 104 ( c ) in the relevant paragraphs within the multilateral surveillance proposition . #% However , we should be opposed to a harmonised and uniform system across the Union . #% The Perry report is another piece of important work and , as the Ombudsman has said , it is appropriate that Mr Perry , the author of the report , is given a role in initiating the whole idea of a code of conduct at European level . #% We will all be in a stronger position to make a judgment on the state of the negotiations to put in place a new European Union treaty when the Taoiseach gives a report of his bilateral discussions to the Council meeting of European Union leaders in March . #% There were shortcomings but our observations were that they were free and fair elections , despite the fact that there were segregated polling stations , and I was dismayed to see that there were separate counts taking place for women voters . #% My final point relates to the call on the Commission to produce a regulation for a block exemption for services of general interest in the event that the European Court may find such support for services of general interest to be in breach of competition law . #% Recent figures show that the population could increase by up to 10 % over the next 10-15 years . #% Why do we not use common sense ? #% He may have overstated our generosity , but that was a stinging indictment of the EU 's attitude to countries such as this . #% Therefore , the price in Ireland can often be very different from that in the rest of the European Union . #% Having said that , we are now holding out a prospect of abolishing VRT and perhaps somewhat dishonestly indicating to Irish consumers that at last they may get a car at a much cheaper rate , in much the same way as in other Member States . #% Today the European Council is deciding whether to write the public out of the GMO process . #% We all know from our own experience that lengthy and costly litigation through the courts is losing its appeal as a means to resolve disputes . #% The citizens of Europe are always reaffirming their demands for a Europe that is much closer to them and this should not exclude the level of governance closest to the people . #% We also have to keep the necessary balance between the rights of travellers , their security and , above all , the safety of air travel against these new terrorist challenges that threaten everyone in Europe , and indeed in the greater world . #% One of the most deplorable aspects of this resolution is the failure to address the issue of the Western Sahara . #% As the UN definition of reproductive health services is so much in conflict with our position as stated in the Treaties - in particular with the protocol of my country - does the Council intend to challenge this publicly stated definition or to change the definition of reproductive health services within the institutions of the EU ? #% Bombing continues ruthlessly and unreported . #% It was particularly noticeable during the exchange of views with Ambassador Rutten and Secretary-General Schutterle of the Energy Charter Conference that instead of defending the difficulties the Union might have in implementing environmental and energy-saving provisions of the Energy Charter , they stated baldly that some Member States did not wish binding provisions for dealing with the environment in the Charter but took the view that these should be dealt with under a separate agreement . #% But it shows that , when Parliament stands together , when the different groups do not allow themselves to be divided and are determined not to give away the powers of this House , we can , with the other institutions , come up with a very good instrument and one that ensures that the prerogatives of this House are protected . #% We are working closely together in the Balkans and Afghanistan . #% I do not actually think that it is necessary to take any money from agriculture in order to finance a decent programme within the amounts of money set out - EUR 5.5 billion - considering what the obligations of the Union are , what the Member States will put up and what is likely to be called upon because of the situation in Serbia . #% The Commission praises our fiscal discipline but we are haemorrhaging jobs . #% These ensure a solid product growth that allows competition and ensures the diversity of supply and production afterwards . #% However , as long as the OIE has concerns about exporting such animals for the food chain , we have to get in line . #% This seems to me to be a grotesque situation and quite simply should not be tolerated by the European Union . #% Children have become invisible in EU policy . #% If we want these new structures to be a success , wide publicity is going to have to be put in place . #% This is a graphic illustration . #% Too much is left up to the Member States . #% Mr President , I am pleased to speak on this timely and well-considered report and I congratulate the rapporteur . #% We plead with Member States to implement what they have said in their declarations . #% I do not believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal . #% Ms Tongue has pointed out that this is a political issue and indeed it very much is . #% This type of cooperation is vital at present . #% I might just mention that , for example , for a long number of years , as Mr Crowley knows well , coming from a part of Ireland which has often had maritime disasters , there has been cooperation between the RAF and the Irish Air Corps . #% We note that this vote includes the creation of a budget item to provide supplementary funding to the High Flux Reactor ( HFR ) at Petten , Netherlands . #% I am aware of the difficulties , as I said , being expressed by these lecturers , some of whom are from my own country , who have made representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs , the Minister for Education and myself . #% To prevent a repeat of such a crisis requires a fundamental revision of the financial regulatory framework and this must include a stronger capital framework for banks . #% A number of measures have already been implemented under the Wye River Accord , including the transfer of control over specific territories as well as the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners . #% The presidency agrees with the honourable Member that this is an important issue . #% If we are serious about protecting the European model of agriculture , with all its constraints and additional costs , and if we are serious about maintaining the rural countryside we must return to prices which are in some way based on , or linked to , the cost of production . #% We are doing this in Ireland , and the Information Society Commission clearly recognises the value of public libraries . #% Let the ten new countries in and let them find their feet first before we start rushing into further European integration . #% How can the Commissioner justify bringing forward these proposed changes at a time when there has been a major review of the common agricultural policy ? #% As a result of these momentous decisions , our new neighbours will be Ukraine , Belarus and Moldova . #% Yes there may be legal means to get us over the legal niceties but there is within this a political signal and message and the signal must be , that however we may criticise the Nice Treaty , and we all do , we must get over that hurdle as a precondition politically not to do with enlargement but to do it ourselves . #% I would like to thank the British Government for rejoining Europe because we badly need them in Europe . #% Tragically , she was proved right . #% This issue has raised concerns in most of the Member States . #% The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted . #% Secondly , it is equally important that the existing workforce is retrained in the skills demanded by new and changing information technologies . #% When put to the test , those who talk the most about human rights and freedom of speech have hypocritically displayed themselves as utterly intolerant in their virulent attacks on Commissioner-designate Buttiglione . #% The negotiations on this deal were led by representatives of the dictatorial Mubarak regime which has been ousted by the revolutionary upheaval . #% What I find most disappointing is the Council 's attitude to this legislation . #% We have others yet to attain that accolade . #% We have not done enough in that sector . #% 
That undermines the credibility of the overall EMU framework . #% I believe that when you remove the farmer and his family from rural society , it begins to disintegrate . #% That is why monies must always be put aside for the development of youth facilities in disadvantaged areas that suffer from drug abuse or which are likely to suffer from drug abuse in the future . #% I am glad to learn that at the meeting of the foreign ministers this week , there was a constructive exchange of views with regard to the need for the new treaty . #% The European Union is a union of states and peoples and the success of the Union as an economic and political entity is premised on the fact that both smaller and larger Member States are treated in many respects as equal partners within the Union . #% Europe should make it clear that it will deal with those elected in new elections regardless of their political affiliation , on the basis of a commitment to implementing agreements accepted by the Palestinian people . #% There may be other such incidents before the process is concluded . #% We know that the majority of suicide cases are linked to mental health , particularly depression . #% I appreciate that the Dutch , for example , have a particular problem about disposing of carcasses so vaccination is for them perhaps an option to ring-fence the disease . #% I oppose the Constitution because I dare still to cling to a belief in maximising meaningful national sovereignty . #% A third area that I wish to focus on is the risk of creating new illiterates or new gaps between those people who have computer and electronic skills and those who do not . #% The current Draconian restrictions on people 's movements can not continue . #% On top of that we have the question of how our policies of today are going to cope in 10 to 15 years ' time , when this population gets older . #% Most , but not all , of the fault lies with previous Commissions , as the report clearly establishes . #% Many people in America now recognise that unilateralism is not the way to go , that we require cooperation , not just in geopolitical terms but also in trade terms , and to ensure that the United Nations and other international bodies can operate effectively . #% The cause of Irish Republicanism must be completely separated from common criminality now and in the future . #% I thank him for according our institution that respect . #% The draft declaration itself was rather weak and disappointing . #% I want to thank Carmen Fraga for her report : a very comprehensive statement and advice to the Commission and Council on the whole business of marketing . #% I am hopeful that these declarations will fully clarify the political concerns that people had with this specific issue during the last Nice Treaty referendum . #% I congratulate Mr Moraes and I welcome the report 's assertion that equal treatment is a basic right and not a privilege , that human rights are indivisible and can not be bought or sold . #% This is the message that came out clearly from Parliament . #% To do that of course requires greater urgency in modernising the democracy of the Union . #% I took some persuading that a directive such as this was necessary at all . #% However , at the end of the day , as politicians , we have to find a way of achieving a democratic political solution to the problem . #% Nowhere is there the same positive commitment to environmental management as in my own country . #% However , in practice Sunday is the only day of the week when the majority of people in our society are not in the workplace or at school or otherwise occupied . #% It is time the European Union got its act together and made it clear that we will not stand for the kind of actions that have been taken in relation to Iraq , that we will unite to put in place serious peaceful conflict-prevention mechanisms to achieve what the world needs , that is , stability and peace . #% Equally vital components of successful tourism policy for an island nation such as Ireland are low-cost air and car-ferry links . #% A sensible solution would be that if the French and the Irish and British are forced out because their system of fishing is unacceptable , then obviously the Spanish fleets will catch more fish and they could concede to the Irish and the British and the French other quotas of similar value and everybody would be happy . #% I feel that whilst each of us in this House would welcome the opportunity to ensure a safer working environment , not only for employees , but also for consumers and other users of transport and so on , we have to ensure that we do not over-regulate in any individual area . #% I recall in particular questions about the overlaps between food law and food safety , the various overlaps that one can imagine with the World Trade Organisation and a host of other responsibilities , not least those of the Environment Commissioner . #% Given that xenophobia and racism is often evident at sporting events , would the President-in-Office consider , as part of the plan , using sport as a way to fight xenophobia ? #% Mr President , we are certainly in the same boat so to speak . #% The European Union is a political model that has helped to bring peace to our continent . #% Firstly , we in the UPE Group are calling for a specific five-year EU action programme to combat this disease , backed-up with adequate resources . #% The first half was the worst in the history of the world : two world wars and 50 million human beings slaughtered . #% The Energy Committee of the European Parliament is right to urge the European Commission to press for negotiations with a view to removing uncertainties by conferring a binding force on the protocol on nuclear safety within this Charter . #% That is why , in spite of supporting this report , it is important to remain vigilant on all the initiatives taken by the Commission to deal effectively and in a broader way with the problem . #% We hope that what happened in East Timor , after the UN persuaded the people to go out and exercise their right to vote and they were subsequently persecuted and murdered by the Indonesians , will not happen when the people in Western Sahara vote . #% That is the road to anarchy ; a road which will give no security for any state on the face of this earth - least of all the small state which I represent here in this Parliament . #% Everyone accepts that many of the EU stocks have been over-exploited . #% I agree with Mrs Wallis that Commissioner Byrne was right to say that he would not accept this , and I hope that Commissioner Vitorino feels the same way , because this would be a disastrous outcome . #% It is not the first time that Holland has saved Europe from political tyranny . #% Secondly , in relation to advertising , we are concerned about toys being advertised to children during children 's programmes , but we also advertise alcohol to them and are introducing them to alcohol at a very young age and making it acceptable . #% By doing this , the Commission is encouraging a culture of secrecy where Member States are not providing the information . #% I want to thank the Committee on Budgets for their understanding and support for the Agriculture Committee 's amendments on the Dairy Fund , on our funding for the school milk and fruit scheme , for the bee populations , and the deprived persons programme . #% Why should we in this Parliament agree to funding any nuclear budget at all under the Euratom budget when Parliament is not able to approve such policies and they are not part of the treaties of the European Union . #% Mr President , systematic abuse and denial of human rights continues in mainland China , yet the Western world remains embarrassingly silent . #% That will be for another day as far as I am concerned . #% Ireland , and in particular Ireland South , has a thriving fishing industry and this Agreement will help to fight against IUU fishing as one of the most serious global threats to the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources . #% These differences would not arise if we were part of the coordination meeting and on the inside . #% I will now use a tremendous cliché truism - ` our greatest resource in the European Union is our people ' . #% There has been over-fishing for many years because of the TACs being set too high , and , basically scientific advice has not been followed . #% Much advertising goes well beyond the erotic to the pornographic with overtones of violence and sadism . #% We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States ' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer . #% Whether it be the imposition of one 's religious beliefs or the denial of the right to practice one 's religion , one is as bad as the other . #% In Ireland at present there are two green rates : the first is for CAP support , such as the payment of export refunds and intervention stocks and has varied substantially over the last eighteen months . #% I can not understand why , if we have a system of transparency and open competition , how we can not prevent that from being used as a protectionist smoke screen in the publication of tenders . #% Insufficient welfare provisions , inadequate social services and high levels of youth unemployment contribute to late marriage and childbirth , thus accelerating the ageing of our populations . #% I know this is a very sensitive and divisive issue in Malta as indeed it is in other Member States including Ireland . #% A `` yes '' vote is a vote to reunite Europe . #% It is very disturbing to hear you , as President of this Parliament , criticise us in the media and question our credibility . #% That is the issue we hope the Commission will address . #% It comes down to the proper screening and treatment of the product regardless of the source . #% The SAVE initiative , which dates back to 1991 , is one of the cornerstones for the European Union policies to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 . #% 
A scan showed damage to my brain , then different tests that were carried out by ophthalmologists for both hospitals and the National Council showed that permanent damage to my eyesight had occurred . #% A balance between the protection of employment law and collective agreements within the EU Member States and opening up a more efficient market for services has been achieved through compromise . #% These oil deposits produce more than three times the carbon emissions of conventional oil and their exploitation is also extremely damaging to the local environment and a threat to the First Nations communities who live in the region . #% On a separate matter , I believe that political dialogue should recommence between the European Union and the Iranian Government . #% This proposal is profoundly flawed , in that it is based on the old-fashioned research which relies on RDAs of vitamins and minerals . #% We may not agree with them and may not ascribe to them ourselves , but we should respect the right of Members of this House and other elected representatives to hold those opinions and try to bring them forward . #% I would point out that , in the past , the individual states and kingdoms which now compose the European Union persecuted and tried to stamp out these minorities , but the European Union now supports them and gives them practical assistance in the form of a budget and , in the case of Ireland , a minority language office in Dublin . #% In my contribution to yesterday 's debate I highlighted the urgency of implementing a full traceability programme from producer to consumer . #% Today , it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it . #% Finally I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute and thank the secretariat of the Fisheries Committee for their assistance and also the secretariat in my own group . #% It focuses on non-technical elements , helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted . #% Could I also ask , Madam President ... #% There was a moan or two for a week when we would forget to bring the old shopping bags , but in changing the mindset this tax on its own has done what years of talking in this Parliament and national parliaments could not do . #% Alternative energy sources are vital for our future . #% While it is not a time for apportioning blame for what has happened , I believe farmers were by and large innocent victims of sections of an unscrupulous animal-feed sector , some of which resorted to the use of sewage sludge as an ingredient in animal feed , while others continued to use illegal meat and bone meal . #% I wish to thank the Commission , the Council and my colleagues , in particular the shadow rapporteurs , for their help in steering through this rather complex procedure . #% No other EU policy change will impact in such a profound and personal way on all citizens and at the same time . #% What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end ? #% We need the Finance Ministers of the European Union to look towards the seventh framework programme and the necessary funding . #% Madam President , access to environmental information is a fundamental right and I am glad that the rapporteur has sought to restrict the use of confidentiality . #% This should be condemned by Parliament as contrary to the rule of law . #% I also recall the President-in-Office of the Council saying that at Kyoto we agreed on concrete reduction targets and greenhouse gas emissions by the industrialized countries . #% Mr President , I also wish to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteurs for their initiative and tact in dealing with this situation . #% It is clear that significant efforts are needed in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey . #% Equally , I believe that the qualified majority voting procedure should not apply to decisions concerning the operation of legal systems within the European Union . #% I support the strategy outlined in this report , I congratulate the rapporteur and I hope Parliament overwhelmingly approves it . #% Madam President , I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur and , indeed , the Commission for bringing up this issue again . #% Personally I feel that if we defended our external borders in the Union as carefully as we sometimes watch the internal Member State borders , we would do more service to the Union . #% : I voted for the report by Mr de Roo today for several important reasons . #% Ironically the European Union can take pride in its achievement in improving health , safety and working conditions through the implementation of the social chapter . #% If you , at the beginning of your presidency , are going to behave towards Hedy d'Ancona , a distinguished parliamentarian for many years , and the other Members of the European Parliament in this fashion , it seems to me that your presidency will fail almost instantly . #% This failure to set a minimum distance and thus protect local communities from the dangers of landfill goes against the precautionary approach and the protection of public health . #% UNICEF was in touch with the real needs of real children . #% Why was it a surprise that there was genocide since the referendum two weeks ago ? #% We need a clear strategy for the 21st century aimed at significantly increasing the share of renewable energy sources in our overall energy policy . #% One of the most significant issues that must come from any review is to demonstrate clearly to the consumer who is responsible in the event of these delays and cancellations . #% Finally , I hope that with both this Commission initiative and the introduction of the single currency , we will witness more transparency , more shopping around by consumers and , consequently , the eventual creation of a real single market in insurance . #% In the on-going reform process , the Commission is moving in the direction of a system of control and accountability . #% It is not only a question of seeking to prevent violence by different factions in the Middle East , it is primarily a question of guaranteeing that conditions can be improved in the hope that the violence ends and that negotiations can be reopened . #% In fact , the last six months have been testament to the fact that the smaller countries in Europe can run an effective and focused presidency of the European Union . #% The alternative will inevitably be overfishing and problems for the industry in the long term . #% Mr President , Mr Prodi this morning you used a Russian word , glasnost , which means openness . #% Mr President , I would like to join previous speakers in complimenting Mrs Anttila for her very objective and balanced presentation . #% I call on Commissioner Flynn to begin work now on drafting a new directive to this effect . #% For this reason , contamination of the environment is possible during the production phase , and during the waste phase once PVC has been used . #% This possibility was removed and I can not understand why . #% Mr Prodi is also reported as saying that any future amendments or revisions of the Treaty should be by parliament or government rather than by popular referendum . #% It is quite clear right down the line , that this is basically about promoting and supporting the arms industry . #% What procedures have been put in place ? #% Detainees have been subjected to brutal and inhumane torture and often prevented from contacting their families and lawyers . #% This is not a humanitarian effort , especially when you see what happened last night , when civilians were killed as a result of NATO activity . #% The institutions of this Union have spoken . #% I would add my voice to others ' condemnations . #% Mrs Roth , speaking earlier for the Greens , spoke of her belief in the need for morality in politics . #% Even if he assures this House that the funding will be used for the non-nuclear components of KEDO , the transfer of such technology is now so evidently dangerous that a complete review of KEDO , deleting the nuclear technology transfers , is necessary . #% We must highlight the areas where the degree of public risk warrants a prior check on qualifications for the first provision of services . #% In fairness to him - and I do not agree with everything that he says on most occasions - he has also brought forward short-term , medium-term and long-term priorities that must be carried out . #% There is absolutely no doubt that intervention is required in Chad . #% They only have one aspiration - you could hardly call it a hope because it is so long-term - and that is that the people in Northern Ireland will find an accommodation with each other . #% In reality , it is a law to stop foreign operators from competing or undermining the US casino and gambling market , while the States of Nevada and Las Vegas continue to develop their own online and remote gambling services . #% Civil enforcement provisions on patents could also negatively impact access to generic medicines , and the Commission should address this concern . #% Member States will be able to create mediation bodies to handle consumer complaints irrespective of whether they are national or cross-border . #% I believe that the Leader programme has in the main been successful and it should be developed to achieve more at local level . #% I have no doubt that over the next ten days there will be further intensification of dialogue between all contracting parties in an effort to broker an agreement for a new European Union Treaty . #% This situation can not continue . #% I was therefore particularly pleased to be there on the historic occasion of the signing of the ceasefire agreement , which hopefully will herald a new dawn of peace and prosperity underpinned by the strengthening of human rights . #% 
We should foster multidisciplinary education and allow for more exchanges between higher education institutions in this sector . #% That is not easy to do and it is something the Parliament holds dear . #% Mr President , today is the 46th anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising of 1959 and this year the Chinese Government is marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region . #% Massive support must therefore be given to peace builders , to ordinary people who on a day-to-day basis begin to build trust and seek out a shared future . #% At least that would go some distance to compensate fishermen for the loss and fishing areas for the loss of jobs they have experienced . #% Initially , Sinn Féin 's Alex Maskey vehemently denied IRA involvement but , two weeks later , having spoken to the family , Sinn Féin 's Gerry Kelly issued a statement on the matter and they accepted IRA involvement . #% Jerusalem is the key issue and it needs to be looked at in a new light . #% This is an area of major importance for this Parliament and an area in which we are gaining international respect . #% If we must have ten new Member States , as we want to , and then perhaps Romania and Bulgaria as soon as possible and then Turkey in due course , then let us put the truth to the people that the Treaty of Nice must be accepted if that is to happen . #% We must compare like with like . #% In the context of south-east Europe , the definition of synergy is one where it represents the ability of a group to outperform even its best individual member . #% Currently , VAT rates on food in some Member States are prohibitive and need to be looked at urgently . #% You can not have single-sex hospitals . #% President-in-Office , I want to support the initiative of my colleague , Mr Hindley , and the remarks of my colleague , Mr Newens . #% This will result in fragmentation of the purpose and focus of legislation . #% On another occasion , a previous Commissioner indicated that the UK Government was unhappy with the Commission revealing the information which was being sought by the Committee on Petitions . #% It is against this background that the two directives must be reviewed . #% We will be faced with this even more now because of our recent enlargement and the reunification of Europe . #% A ` business as usual ' policy is not an option in a Europe that needs finance for jobs and growth . #% The extent of the damage caused by speculation in the financial sector highlights the importance of preventive measures such as taxation of financial transactions and warrants considering compensation from the sector for the costs of the crisis . #% Organic and genetic modification are opposites . #% Aer Lingus estimates that up to 200 jobs would be put directly at risk if it is forced out of airport groundhandling services while the central representative Council of Trade Unions at Dublin Airport envisages a steep decline in safety . #% We could return to the subject at a later stage in another way and produce some costings and a tighter , more comprehensive proposal as to how we will put the ideals expressed in this report into effect . #% The two most important issues that come before the Petitions Committee are the recognition of people 's qualifications to work in other Member States and the environmental impact of construction development . #% This is something that will not unravel anything , nor will it upset balances in the final outcome . #% We had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of acres being submerged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water . #% First of all , the EU has no power in the field of spatial planning , yet it presumes to chart a course for this on the back of the dead Constitution . #% Mr President , I join with other speakers in complimenting the rapporteur and welcoming his report . #% The World Bank has done excellent work on this . #% In the UK , the British Jubilee Debt campaign are trying to mobilise politicians to support this . #% Indeed I will be calling on my own government in Ireland to refuse to participate in this rapid reaction force unless there is a clear commitment that these weapons will not be used . #% Both the young and the elderly experience different forms of age discrimination , particularly as regards access to the labour market and certain social services . #% No international observers were permitted at the trial . #% I do not want my part of the United Kingdom , Northern Ireland , treated instead as part of the territorial whole of the island of Ireland . #% I share the view of the rapporteur that what is needed are concrete proposals for firm action . #% How will these relate to the regulations ? #% It seems sensible to simplify how we operate the funds . #% We need to use EU money as a seed to grow local solutions . #% I regret that both my colleagues and myself who met with Commission officials many months ago have not heard from them or seen any action taken . #% The options for decoupling direct payments will allow these payments to be made safe from WTO challenges and so protect their contribution to farm incomes and to the rural economy . #% We have large gaps in what we are arguing for , in principle , in relation to human rights . #% Behind our trade barriers there is the risk that we will cultivate the seeds of more international conflict . #% Among other things , we wanted to find a way to enable women to have the number of children that women said they wanted . #% Although Latin American countries would be the most indebted in global amounts , it is the sub-Saharam African countries that are in most difficulty . #% Who could have forecast that in the second half of that century all those countries would be together or that we would be all together as we are today ? #% However , the use of our intelligence is also necessary to undermine the sense of alienation and injustice felt by many of those who are recruited to commit these kinds of awful acts . #% In the light of the proposals on better government that came out last week , which Mr Harbour mentioned , I want to ask you three specific questions . #% John Hume , a former member of the Socialist Group was the architect of the PEACE programme and its contribution to reconciliation has been enormous . #% This was the central objective that needed to be achieved during these treaty negotiations and I now believe that the way ahead is clear for candidate countries to join the Union in the near future . #% We seem to be able to pursue the terrorists responsible for the horrific events of 11 September , but it seems to be beyond us to tackle international drug terrorists . #% author . - Madam President , I am very happy to support the call for the ratification and implementation of the updated ILO conventions by the EU Member States . #% The conflict should be examined on the basis of the guideline that public health has primacy over patents . #% If this is to happen then it must be accompanied by a commitment to increase the resources available to secure the external borders against the activities of the drug smugglers . #% Parliament confuses itself with this argument about what is compulsory and non-compulsory . #% Bearing in mind that voters will be going to the polls in both Britain and Ireland next Thursday , it would be somewhat ironic , indeed tragic , if we were to witness a massive rejection of euro-scepticism in Britain while at the same time it gained significant ground in Ireland . #% Having said that , I should like to make one request . #% Shame on us for allowing the sale of arms and weapons to the Great Lakes region . #% I have to say that I find the second part of conclusion 11 by Mr Scapagnini unacceptable , because it recommends additional help to nuclear power . #% I know you can not join us in Punta del Este , but I would ask that you make it very clear to those honourable people who will be representing you there that you would like the precedent you created last December to continue . #% There seems to be a need to direct our lives , to minimise risks and to tell us what to do . #% This financing must be new and additional ( the existing promises of 0.7 % should not be touched ) and it must be adequate enough to allow developing countries to fight climate change , with the necessary mitigation and adaptation measures . #% For it is all very well to support peace and the role of the UN , but we must do this actively - if not , we risk contributing to the suffering of the Sudanese people . #% One is the detail of what is proposed and the other is the timing . #% Mr President , PVC is the second most commonly used plastic . #% EU governments are also committed to playing a key role in the reconstruction of Iraq ; the EU made a five-year commitment at the donors ' conference in 2003 and will be at the forefront in providing financial assistance to the new Iraqi administration . #% How we provide care and services for people is how we will be judged . #% 
Parliament can then focus on the job that it was elected to do : assessing the performance of the Council and the Commission on behalf of the people . #% Why do I link that with the budget debate ? #% What then if pandemic disease outbreaks , already ravishing Brazil in terms of foot-and-mouth , spread throughout that continent ? #% There is absolutely no doubt in my view that that is the case and it has given rise to all kinds of concerns . #% Right now , I am most concerned about the level to which this House is being kept informed of negotiations . #% We can not ignore the reports of great human rights abuses . #% Our government and the main political parties are telling us that the Amsterdam Treaty has nothing to do with defence . #% Providing expertise is one thing , taking advice is another . #% The Council dodged the issue ; we should not . #% Most Member States are uneasy about the approach being taken by the scientific sub-groups and would prefer a more open and transparent system of classification as set out in the OIE code which is recognised and accepted by countries worldwide . #% It is a year where the emphasis and the élan which was brought to this task by the Swedish Presidency has borne fruit . #% Those parties which seek to legitimise and promote racism and discrimination through the ballot box , and we have examples in many countries , should take note of this directive and incorporate the recommendations and its legal force in their own constitutions . #% Between legal fees , translation fees and implementation fees , it can cost small businesses up to EUR 15 000 to enter the e-commerce market of just one Member State . #% This evening we are dealing with a proposal for revising the monitoring mechanisms laid down in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and in the Kyoto Protocol . #% These are not my words but the words of children and young people from my country , Ireland , and other EU countries . #% Cattle breeds are different because the gene pool to which they belong has been modified through selection for certain characteristics . #% That is not just European progress but a measure of significant progress on the ground . #% Maybe , when we speak about design and energy-efficient design , those kinds of design features should be taken out of televisions and radios and computers , so that there is no standby . #% We are anxious to ensure that there will be no delay between the ending of the present LEADER II and the beginning of LEADER III . #% There are large variations , depending on the size of the farm and the system of farming . #% On the contrary , we want to see the dismantling of nuclear institutions which , if they are involved in bad accidents , could certainly bring a lot of ruin and disaster to the Member States of the European Union . #% Defining ` sludge ? in the Annex might help clarify the situation . #% We have to put pressure on Vietnam to release all prisoners who are being imprisoned or detained for peacefully expressing their religious and political beliefs . #% One of the issues that must be looked at most carefully relates to the regulatory framework in Europe -- we need less regulation in Europe , not more . #% I have noted the importance of in voting to-day . #% I urge my fellow citizens in Ireland to take that into account . #% You simply can not get public access to the information , and this is something which is essential for small enterprises . #% Dennis Halliday , who resigned from his position as director of the UN humanitarian mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions , confirms the UNICEF statistics - five to six thousand children die every month as a direct result of the sanctions . #% In doing so , we should address a serious failure under FP7 to provide funding for research in maternal and child health . #% It would threaten the independent , commercially based and subsidy free nature of British ports . #% I will say no more , but I am disgusted - we must all be disgusted - at this savagery . #% I would like the Commissioner to address those two issues . #% Why then , for example , do imported cars - which now represent over 70 % of the UK market - get dearer as the pound is getting stronger ? #% I am convinced that this must entail such factors as closer links between fishermen , scientists , the recognition of the socio-economic factors in areas highly dependent on fisheries , flexibility and simplification . #% Electromagnetic fields ( EMF ) are a matter of direct concern to EU citizens . #% I do not mind what your views are on this issue . #% Of course alternative regulation is a subject of much scepticism . #% Shame on us in the European Union for not stamping out racism and xenophobia which are endemic in my country and in the EU in general . #% They could not do this for other fishermen , but only for their own . #% Finally , this motion supports the UNHCR and calls on the Commission to establish a closer partnership with the UNHCR by offering both political and financial support to assist them in their office in Cairo in order to work more closely with the Egyptian authorities to find lasting solutions to the difficult situation of Sudanese migrants and refugees in Egypt . #% The European Union started with two energy Treaties : the European Coal and Steel Community and the Euratom Treaty . #% Opposing this measure will have the effect of excluding many women from the labour force , thereby losing a valuable resource . #% The requirement for the Commission to present a report , within six years , will also give us the option to revisit this important area and properly assess its impact in practice . #% We are concerned that the way in which Europe is developing creates real risks for the safety , protection and wellbeing of its young citizens . #% The fact that the United States and the European Union could not recently come to an agreement on the permitted level of future gas emissions is certainly an unwelcome development . #% In the time that remains to me I should like to turn to Mr Verheugen and to the Council . #% It concerns human rights and the fight against terrorism , which in many ways seems like a contradiction in terms . #% It is emerging as a huge barrier to investment and the government is doing very little to remedy this situation , apart from giving endless employment to consultants . #% The bottom line is simply this : the roadmap remains the mostly likely framework within which to achieve a resolution to the Israel -- Palestine conflict . #% Socio-economic research which tells us how our society is growing and what we could do to make it better is essential . #% We need to open that debate . #% If violence can be ended in the Middle East and the conditions for the reopening of negotiations can be secured , we can once again come to a situation whereby bottom-line issues can be discussed . #% I have in my hand a resolution which is going before the House of Commons today on the issue of Bloody Sunday . #% In fact -- not in Auschwitz but in other concentration camps -- the ovens were made originally to eliminate disabled people . #% This issue is of such importance to Ireland , especially in these economic times , that I had to vote against this proposal . #% I note that the Commission is proposing a review in 2005 but I would urge that you also ask the Member States to make annual reports on achieving the targets in the White Paper . #% At present , consumers are faced with a deluge of marketing ploys in order to entice them to purchase food products . #% It has the advantage of clarity and certainty and avoids the endless institutional complications of the alternative proposed to us . #% Once appointed , H.G. Wessberg will serve until the end of Sweden 's mandate , that is until March 2012 , and could then be re-elected for another mandate of six years . #% After all , the Commission gave a favourable opinion in 1995 as did this Parliament , on Malta 's accession . #% In 2000 , for example , 531 million coupons were redeemed in the UK ; between 1999 and 2000 there was a 122.5 % increase in consumer use of Internet coupons and promotions . #% I do not believe that anyone in this Chamber would deny that recent events in East Timor were totally predictable and therefore to some extent preventable . #% I am very pleased about the attention that is now being given to the theme of gender balance , of mainstreaming throughout the Community 's policies , including the Fifth Framework Programme . #% The situation in Iraq is a dispiriting one , to say the least . #% I would remind Mr Kirkhope and others that the experience in Northern Ireland and everywhere else is that by labelling sections of society you actually increase alienation and you drive recruitment to the organisations that are engaged in terrorism . #% I propose to stick completely to Parliament 's first reading and thus to say that we will reinstate - have reinstated - all amendments . #% 
Finally , without anticipating the future too much , my own group feels sufficiently strongly about this participation that if Parliament was inappropriately excluded or diminished in its institutional role we would consider recommending that it should not give any opinion on an Intergovernmental Conference . #% The proposal from the Commission is not only fundamentally flawed but it is also extremely disappointing . #% . Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Modrow , for taking the initiative to produce a report on this important subject . #% The fundamental rationale of all EU food aid policy must obviously be to guarantee that the food in question gets to the communities and regions where it is most needed . #% I know that we will have a very good advertising and information campaign , and that we will capture the imagination of the citizens of Europe . #% We will achieve a cohesive Union but we must be responsible in our attitude to the whole question of what is intentionally fraudulent and what are simply mistakes and errors that can not , in the short term , be avoided . #% Copenhagen or no Copenhagen , climate change will be with us for decades to come . #% How can we accomplish anything ? #% Whilst provisions specific to exposure to artificial radiation are appropriate , the inclusion of natural sunlight radiation caused me to vote against this Directive as excessive and burdensome in its ambit and impact . #% Like many of my colleagues I am interested in the impact on clubs in the north-west of England , which is , after all , the home of football . #% If at any time the discards exceed part of that closure , then the fishermen will quite readily accept . #% I support the recommendation that all schools in Europe must be equipped with the Internet . #% I want to have an answer from the President-in-Office before I ask my supplementary . #% Computer-implemented inventions are present , as the Commissioner has said , in everyday household appliances , from safety devices such as airbags in cars to mobile phones , washing machines and an endless list of other devices with relevance going well beyond the traditional computer industries to the heart of our manufacturing sectors . #% This is not strictly true . #% But have we reached a point where we have sidelined men ? #% If we want to encourage people to stay in farming - in particular young people - we must not turn farming into a career that is more to do with mountains of paperwork than producing food and taking care of the land . #% This resolution uses strongly worded language and condemns a number of countries who are openly attempting to restrict and censor information over the web , referring to them as enemies of freedom of expression . #% I would urge the European Commission to allocate substantial funds to ensure that this new scheme is widely publicised across the European Union . #% People can not look at the dwindling stocks and our failure to conserve them and say that the wide oceans out there present us with opportunities . #% So why do we get this pressure from the fishing communities to maintain large expensive fleets if , in fact , the fish are not there and we are bound by quotas ? #% This is erroneous . #% We are all aware of the current difficulties faced by farmers . #% Secondly , you must have targets and you must monitor them . #% This is a very tough challenge indeed , not only for European Union governments but also for the European Commission , and indeed for ourselves in the European Parliament . #% I should like to congratulate both our colleagues on their excellent reports . #% However , I find it extraordinary that in at least one Member State , Cohesion Fund investment in one region has caused major problems in another . #% Organisations which use violence , should be told very clearly that their claim to be acting to achieve human and civil rights for people is completely false , because their method undermines the most fundamental human right of all , the right to life . #% Upon recalling the last 15 months , for example , we have witnessed the tsunami disaster in Asia ; the strong tropical cyclone in Louisiana and Mississippi ; the devastating floods in Romania , Bulgaria , Switzerland , Austria , Germany and France ; the serious drought in Spain and Portugal and the fires that have destroyed nearly 180 000 hectares of forest in Portugal . #% It beggars belief that this undemocratic attitude is being expressed here by the Irish Greens and by others . #% By insisting on better pay , the EU is also ensuring that there is a market in third party countries for EU exports . #% I want to thank the German Government and the German Members of Parliament for their understanding of this particular case and for their support for my campaign for the proper treatment of prisoners in English jails . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I am happy for this report to be debated jointly with the report on the eurozone . #% I say to Commissioner Papoutsis that we know he has a strong and sincere commitment to renewable energy . #% Initially , we also thought that microchip numbers could be changed . #% Governments also need to understand that carers need more help and more staff need to be employed by health boards in Member States to provide carers with respite care , day care and other supports . #% Firstly , I wish to thank all my colleagues , in particular the shadow rapporteur , Mrs Corbey , for the cooperation we had during a long and difficult enough debate at times . #% In all agreements with third countries the European Union must continue to press for the inclusion of specific human rights clauses . #% With the proposed enlargement of the European Union to central and eastern Europe , we must take a strong hand in safeguarding our European objective which , of course , is to develop agriculture as a major and competitive player in world trade . #% The rapporteur has done an excellent job in highlighting these and in showing how to avoid the mistakes of the past . #% Jacques Delors was aware of this when he wrote in his White Paper that environmental technologies can create jobs and , in that way , bring about a much fairer society . #% There is no point in us saying that we support Israel or Palestine . #% But there have been difficulties for many in Ireland , as the Ryanair dispute earlier this year clearly showed . #% So it is not a good idea to leave these matters in the hands of Member States - and certainly not a good idea to leave it in the hands of the current Irish Government , the ruling party of which Mr Crowley is a member . #% . Mr President , as one of the 26 MEPs who attended the world trade talks I would agree with the Commissioner that there was some success -- it was not a complete failure . #% We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard . #% It is the first time that they have submitted comprehensive proposals . #% In addition , there has been quite an amount of legislation to cater for the introduction of the euro , covering areas such as finance and social welfare . #% In the past year children who have been missing - in some cases for up to 18 months - have been recovered . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mrs Theato on her report . #% We fail to mainstream the solutions that various boards and reports have identified . #% You can provide state aids that are untouchable , even by a Commissioner as powerful as yourself ! #% We want legal certainty . #% I would also like to know , as regards our international obligations under the WTO general procurement agreement with third countries , whether it would be the case , as has been established by Commission services , that the US and Japan would actually be favoured contractors and that our EU suppliers would lose out because we would be operating two distinctly different regimes . #% There is a real urgency about this and we need to start thinking outside the box . #% However , I believe that the idea to establish an Internet charter which will be a legally non-binding document setting out internationally agreed objectives and principles in areas such as taxation , liability , jurisdiction and data protection would be a very good idea indeed . #% I am absolutely horrified . #% With regard to peace funding , the EU has enabled many people of goodwill to contribute to peace-building in Northern Ireland . #% We should not use spurious environmental arguments to condemn a practice that we know and is scientifically shown to have no implications other than the catching of tuna fish . #% One abuse can not justify another . #% As well as reassuring consumers , it will also remove another weapon from the armoury of those who have reservations about enlargement going ahead as quickly as possible . #% I might say that if there is any question of any need for safety measures then I have no difficulty with supporting the proposal for an environmental audit which the honourable Member outlines . #% I welcome the presence of the Commissioner and want to say we were proud and a little sad to note that she worked herself into the ground before Christmas on fishing problems . #% In the interests of saving time I will not insist on giving any fuller explanation . #% I would recommend the American model of repeat tests : a written test is taken every four years and a road test every eight years and skills must be kept up . #% The revised Stability and Growth Pact gives more countries more time to correct excessive deficits and provides more leeway for countries with strong public finances . #% 
The need to help farmers affected by the BSE crisis has once again demonstrated the importance of maintaining the CAP budget at a level which can fund the ongoing farm programmes while at the same time responding to emergency situations such as the beef crisis and the recovery of consumer confidence in healthy beef and opening up all the internal European markets for disease-free beef from other European Union Member States . #% We are somewhat sceptical about the degree to which this should be autonomous of transatlantic relations . #% I want to see a situation where criminals , whether they are drug dealers , IRA , bank robbers or white-collar fraudsters find it impossible to launder their ill-gotten gains anywhere in Europe . #% Mr President , in the context of Johannesburg and the commitments to sustainability by the EU , it should not be too much to ask this Parliament to give concrete expression to sustainability , particularly in requiring that the principle of producer responsibility and the internalisation of external costs be enshrined in the current review . #% Have we not learnt anything from the recent referendum on the Treaty of Nice in Ireland ? #% As the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities . #% Public transport vehicles and captive fleets should use clean and alternative fuels to provide a stimulus for the market , for the private sector , and to kick start the process of installing a network of forecourt outlets . #% The Irish stability programme is central to the budgetary process in Ireland . #% Furthermore , President Jiang 's plea to Macau 's government not to allow criticism of Beijing raises fundamental questions about the Chinese Government 's commitment to allow freedom of expression which is fundamental to the success of the one-country two-systems policy . #% We endorse the resolution , especially the comments about the lack of overall analysis , and criticisms by the Commission of the Member States and the lack of progress in monitoring the marketing channels . #% For that reason the European Union , rather than having an army , should set up a Commission department of peace and reconciliation with a Commissioner of peace and reconciliation to spread this philosophy . #% There is no doubt that the teeming human misery of refugees in that part of our world is unbearable to see , but I want to state very clearly that there are a number of core difficulties with this proposed mission . #% As regards non-regulation by Community law , my understanding is that before 2002 a certain amount of EU funding was devoted to greyhound breeding in Ireland once funding for sheep breeding had stopped because there was an over-capacity of sheep . #% I am opposed to the standardisation or harmonisation of taxes and these issues can be and must be dealt with by means of co-ordinated measures . #% Monitoring of Irish groundwater by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that there is no widespread contamination of individual aquifers . #% However , the institutions of the Union have yet to grasp the importance of this task . #% The right -- both Europhiles and Europhobes -- have used this issue as a wedge in their campaign to renationalise health and safety regulations , ignoring the fact that , in an open , competitive economy , if you do not have European regulation , you will have no regulation . #% First of all , I welcome Mr van Velzen 's emphasis on life sciences other than genomics and his advocacy of translational research , which means rapid transposition into clinical applications . #% We feel strongly that a real initiative to prevent injury and promote safety is so important that it needs to be put on its own stream within the health programmes . #% This market has worked extremely well and when serious animal health problems arise , such as foot-and-mouth disease , swine fever or Newcastle disease , the geographical area involved is isolated and suspended from the common trade arrangements until that disease is controlled and eradicated . #% The implementation of Ms Angelilli 's report means that the protection of children from these abusive practices will increase in response to technological developments , targeting , in particular , the sinister practice of ` grooming ' . #% It is not about diluting the availability of health services for women in need . #% The whole question of transition arrangements is of the greatest importance . #% But there was some misunderstanding , for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission . #% Once this principle is established we must go further to refine testing . #% I was in what was then Rhodesia in the 1960s and there was a great deal of injustice in that country at that time . #% I believe it will be the hard-pressed consumers who will end up bearing the brunt . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mr van Velzen for focusing on the White Paper on an energy policy for the European Union in his report . #% I have one specific question for Commissioner Fischler . #% That is not always clear to them . #% We can see that with Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom there is no border in the new Europe between Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland . #% For 42 stocks it set TACs that were more than 10 % higher than the Commission 's proposal . #% The Commission and the European Maritime Safety Agency will carry a huge responsibility . #% This is a very fine judgment . #% Obviously , we must ensure security of supply of power in a sustainable way and we have an opportunity to look at alternative sources of power which we can exploit whilst , at the same time , helping the environment . #% We in the European Parliament should be involved in encouraging a wide and open debate as a prelude to a full institutional participation après-Laeken . #% We can all point to individual examples and different times when terrorist acts have so horrified us that we have wanted to respond according to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . #% This will weaken our voice if we attempt to raise it within the context of the UN Special Summit on Children next year , at which the issue of child soldiers will be a significant point . #% The reluctance of young people to take up farming as a career is evidence of the problem within agriculture . #% Following the impact of liberalisation , it has lost significant parts of the profitable portion of its market while it continues to bear the burden of carrying a universal service obligation to the furthest corners of the Republic of Ireland . #% The central nervous system bioeffects - which the Commission does not refer to - seem to be occurring where mobile phone masts are located close to people 's homes . #% The Council , however , instead of increasing recycling or environmentally sound recovery to meet the recovery target , insisted on putting incineration on an equal footing with recovery , contrary to the ECJ ruling . #% This seems to be a version of ` honour amongst thieves ' in that it is the countries involved in the arms industry which will make the decisions , and countries which have an ethical position as regards arms exports will have no say . #% It is now clearly established that the EU-assisted programmes , such as Leader , have the potential to create sustainable employment in rural areas where more centralised programmes would have failed . #% So what more have we to do ? #% I did not hear that mentioned recently . #% Never mind the cynics ! #% Are the inspection procedures and sampling arrangements at import points into the Union adequate ? #% This is particularly the case on the continent of Africa . #% As the Conservative-led government in the United Kingdom has shelved legislation on transparency introduced by the previous Labour Government , I welcome the inclusion of my proposal to introduce such a requirement at the EU level . #% These are matters strictly speaking within the competence of the Member States but it is clear that as a Union and as a Parliament we have an obligation to seek to ensure that European citizens are treated properly . #% The precautionary approach should mean that before any stock can be fished on a commercial basis there must be , at the very least , a scientific assessment of the stock and a conservatively-based total allowable catch . #% The Common position offers the most appropriate means of ensuring that we can achieve the objective of guaranteeing that employees have real access to information and consultation , and also offers them an opportunity to have an input into the continuing operation of the enterprise . #% At the end of the 20th century to ban an exhibition by a gay artist is completely unacceptable and no Member of this Parliament should endorse that . #% I should like to express my deep gratitude to all my colleagues in this Parliament for their unanimous support for this peace project because it is making such a very positive contribution to the development of peace in my country . #% Virtually all of us have used them and come into contact with them . #% In view of recent developments , notably the massive rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by the French farming community , who , it must be said , have been one of the main beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy down the years , perhaps the Commissioner could tell us if , in the event that there is no rapid agreement on future financing , there will be a ` plan B ' for rural development #% We are equally aware of the discrepancy between the EU audiovisual market size and the position of EU productions within that market . #% Mr President , it is a disgrace at this vital time in the history of Europe that a shadow lies over the Commission . #% We should see this Commission as a college and while the individual commissioners must be held accountable , nevertheless we must take an objective view of what is going on and beware of either European party politics or international politics colouring our judgement . #% As the Commissioner stated , the EU has ensured many improvements in animal welfare during transportation . #% The cooperation that is necessary from all Member States and the need to take advantage of the stimulus packages currently launched by almost all Member States and the Commission underscore the need for investment in renewable technology to increase our energy security and decrease our CO2 emissions . #% I have seen situations where a large number of people from a particular sector , which is well financed by the Union , seem to be able continuously to get away with violations of our rules and regulations on the spending of money . #% I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said . #% In this climate this is simply not good enough . #% In this document there are significant clauses interpreting the mutual relationship between our institutions that also constitute significant progress . #% 
The Irish Government intends to propose a joint action to serve as a legal base for the allocation of funds from the budget of the European Communities . #% I do not share these concerns , but Irish citizens need assurance in these points , not only in the context of this debate , but also with regard to long-term Irish interests within the EU . #% These provisions attack the very independence essential to any inquiry . #% It would introduce a form of creeping protectionism and an attempt to block the completion of the internal market in sensitive sectors . #% We would have the resources for investment in research and development , fighting climate change and in building solidarity between the regions of the EU . #% Labelling of all consumer products and in particular all food items , including soft and alcoholic drinks , is essential to give the consumer a clear description of the items concerned . #% We have considerable experience with the original rather limited liberalisation directive in our Member States . #% I agree with the rapporteur when she states that libraries represent one of the most important systems which afford access to knowledge and culture . #% From the outset , they will be equals , they will have the same rights as the existing members . #% A weighting to reflect the different banking systems may very well be necessary in the fund . #% Earlier this year the European Council in Cologne decided to establish a chapter for fundamental rights which will bring together in one comprehensive document all the fundamental rights applicable at European Union level in order to make these rights more visible to its citizens . #% It is true that we urgently need to peel back regulation and that China is investing threefold in research and innovation . #% In light of these considerations , I believe the EU must exercise extreme caution in embracing the biotechnology industry without the outmost care and precautions being in place . #% The report calls on the Eurogroup , the Council and the ECB to exercise their respective powers and responsibilities in full coordination . #% Groups representing the food industry , farm organisations and consumer interests are all actively involved in the implementation of these directives and regulations . #% If we really want to get people 's backs up and alienate young people from the European Union , that would be the way to go ! #% It therefore makes a lot of political sense for the European Union to take a lead coordinating role to promote better health within the European Union . #% Of course we must give the tools to our security services to ensure that they are able not only to prevent terrorism , but also to capture the perpetrators of terrorism , those who finance terrorism and those who are involved in other forms of criminality , whether it be drug-trafficking , money-laundering or people-trafficking . #% While the Taoiseach was speaking to our European partners inside the Council in an attempt to repair the damage inflicted on our reputation , his finance minister , Charlie McCreevy , was outside describing the Irish rejection of the Nice Treaty as a remarkable and healthy development . #% We must recognize economic development , social development , environmental protection and human rights as mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development . #% In fact , I would seriously question our data . #% So I will actively look for the Commission to pursue a different strategy , because I believe that the State aid map is out of date . #% In relation to the matters raised by Mr Paisley : those are dealt with adequately in the agreement and the task of us all is to implement all aspects of that agreement and for all parties to do it together . #% Let us solve the first problem before we do any such thing . #% I would not , and I am sure no other colleague would either . #% The state aid action plan says that we need to maintain a level playing field for all companies active in the single market . #% The EU leaders reaffirmed the inclusive nature of the accession process which now comprises 13 candidate States within a single framework . #% In the European Union we devote something like 0.3 % of our resources to development cooperation as a whole . #% With this they monitored chat channels for 16 hours . #% We export 90 % of our animals and about 10 % of those , or 200 000 live cattle , are exported every year to markets in France , Italy , Spain and the Netherlands . #% Mr President , I warmly welcome the statement made by Minister Roche on behalf of the Irish presidency here this afternoon . #% What is the money we create for ? #% The ECJ , after years of deliberation , becomes the arbiter of better legislation . #% I congratulate all concerned for reaching that agreement so that the card can be in active use by 1 June 2004 . #% This is a very important initiative and this is an opportune time for it to be brought forward . #% That is the thin edge of the wedge . #% For the equestrian and racing industries , Saturday , Sunday and bank holiday Mondays must be covered for the movement of animals for breeding or for emergency operations or for competition purposes - because the horse does not carry , it is not susceptible . #% The subject matter is vast and varied . #% Thank you for your reply , Commissioner , which was quite explicit . #% That is something of concern to many people in my constituency . #% Everybody believes that everybody else has a better deal . #% It is clear that Greece will shortly join the existing 11 Member States who are participating in the economic and monetary union , and I wish to congratulate Greece on its economic recovery and wish it well in the future . #% Women imprisoned in jails anywhere in the Community must be treated properly and with dignity . #% As the signatures to the amendments show here today , that is not the case and should not have been stated , especially at what was a very sensitive time in the concluding stages of the negotiations . #% Mr President , the world is full of conflict and dictatorship , hardship and poverty and it is the innocent victims who pay the price . #% No cost-benefit analysis is provided for the further reduction of emissions from plants with already low emission concentrations . #% Mr President , I rise on the issue of human rights abuses in Colombia . #% There is no embargo on bringing armaments into that region . #% You also have extremely toxic ash left afterwards . #% Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence , and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100 % ? #% There is one extremely important issue that must be tackled in the framework of the new cooperation agreements and that is the issue of arms sales . #% Secondly , will outside technical assistance be used in the operation of the programme ? #% It is also the view of my own group , which passionately supports that way forward . #% A prime example of this , in the Irish context , is environmental legislation . #% We had the opportunity of meeting you in the lead-up to the presidency and we found our working relationship with you quite cordial . #% He said he would come back to Parliament when the Commission had taken a decision . #% Some in this Parliament and other places may use Members ' passion for and belief in protecting the cultures and diversity of languages within the European Union as a way of attacking such Members . #% The internal market will still be protected from unjustified trade barriers under the environment legal base , Article 175 , which is predicated on protection of the single market . #% The imbalance has been somewhat redressed by the public health competence given to us by the Maastricht Treaty . #% We are investing heavily in the implementation of food safety measures and have banned the use of growth promoters . #% Important decisions have to be made in key areas , particularly the social and economic dimension of the common fisheries policy . #% But if they do not do that they become flaccid , rot and become totally useless - just another expensive quango , not actually achieving any great results . #% You gave it , the Commission followed ; this House followed . #% Directive 81/851 and Council Regulation No 2377/90 are however still to be amended to allow such use . #% I make no comment on the issue that was being raised , but this is the second time that access to Parliament has been impeded by the same demonstrators . #% Let us make it known that the Community 's cooperation and assistance policies and programmes already extensively incorporate the fight against crime . #% 
They do not want to see broad economic guidelines debated here once a year , having no effects to them on the ground . #% Nevertheless , this is a tangible reality for citizens of Europe . #% Despite the fact that the EU will not join the Council of Europe ( CoE ) , accession to the convention should entail the right to nominate candidates for the post of judge , and allow for European Parliament representation in the Parliamentary Assembly of the CoE when this body elects judges to the European Court of Human Rights . #% This would mean that antibiotic-resistant products that have already been authorised would remain . #% But , you know , I think if we are going to depend on the car industry - and we are going to totally defend it - then I think we are picking the wrong particular area in which to do this , and certainly General Motors would not be the most important in my area , as far as I would be concerned . #% The sixth VAT Directive , which was originally designed to allow the abolition of tax frontiers and the creation of a common tax system , is a very important political message , particularly now when we speak about a market of 340 million people . #% To conclude , I want to support the call by my colleagues for a European taskforce , not only to monitor the existing situation , but whose remit would also be to monitor and approve a European-wide eradication programme . #% You , Commissioner , talked of the political efforts that you are making , but do we deserve this praise ? #% As he said , tobacco smuggling is a very lucrative business . #% I know that many organizations in Ireland fighting on these issues would definitely welcome this step . #% A man died last week because he could not have simple surgery in our hospital system . #% The European approach in opening up energy markets and making them more efficient is well balanced . #% However , in reality , the fear is a fear of change . #% The scope of the register covers many activities carried out with the objective of directly or indirectly influencing the policy formulation or implementation and decision-making processes of the European institutions . #% On Friday we received the very tragic news that he had been executed . #% We have just voted in the Committee on Regional Policy on my report on the implementation of funds in the UK , and we are very much aware that employment rates are higher in the UK . #% If we could develop a single policy , if we could pool our resources and if we could achieve that target of 0.7 % , we would have something like EUR 70 billion to dispense throughout the world . #% Mr President , I have worked very closely with my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and I feel that this compromise package of amendments , which we are going to vote on today , is the best outcome we could have hoped for on integrated coastal zone management . #% There are divisions largely on questions of strategy and , in some cases , tactics . #% We also agree that there should be an emphasis on fuel poverty . #% This Parliament has to be very careful that it does not allow President Uribe to use this opportunity as a propaganda stunt , to give an impression that somehow the human rights situation in Colombia is improving . #% We have a situation in the European Union where farmers are leaving the industry hand over fist in every Member State . #% But there also needs to be support for NGOs and Member State governments to raise awareness about the impact and effects of sexual violence , be it domestic , rape or human trafficking for sexual exploitation . #% We are witnessing the slow strangulation of a wonderful nation and a wonderful people . #% The credibility of an EU observation mission 's final report will depend to a significant degree on the perceived and actual independence of its work . #% Madam President , life is one constant risk-benefit analysis - what we do , where we go and what we eat . #% In particular last year , when there was a breakdown of the peace process , these projects were vital peace lifelines . #% It seems wrong that this should be allowed to continue , particularly when there are sister banks on both sides of the border . #% In the last 18 months , 34 countries have reported outbreaks . #% The Commission itself has said that this could bring about savings of greater impact , of approximately EUR 6 billion per annum . #% A rushed and ill-considered liberalisation would be highly dangerous . #% Therefore , a roundtrip will incur a fee of EUR 300 as a result of this legislation . #% Mr President , I wish to speak on the Poignant report . #% We would like the Council to assist us with the earliest possible time but if they fail to approve the Commission by 5 May , then at least we should have as a fallback that we can approve the Commission within the life of the Parliament . #% We all agree with that . #% Mr President , when we talk about human rights we have to talk about the right for everybody to be treated equally , both before the law and in society itself . #% Cheap imports are now the scourge of EU manufacturing and processing industries . #% With the combined efforts of the Community and the Member States which have primary responsibility for energy policy , I believe that these targets can be attained . #% It is therefore offensive and utterly wrong that women in economic need in poor countries are being offered financial incentives to become paid donors . #% That is why I had to vote against him . #% I do not think it would be fair or reasonable to hold out the hope that all languages in the Union will become working languages . #% The companies who are currently pleading that they will be uncompetitive if they have to invest in order to create clean energy and more efficient technologies are the ones who escape scot-free ! #% I intend , on behalf of my own group , notwithstanding the mission you have conferred on Madame Garaud , to whom again , on behalf of my group , I wish to express our profound sympathy , to take direct personal contact with the Spanish authorities , because we have a right to have an early and urgent answer . #% I share his view that the space industry must ` boldly go along the path towards a concentration which will enable it to compete with American manufacturers . ' #% Mr President , I particularly want to thank Mrs McCarthy for her work on this difficult report . #% That was what the General Affairs Council on 29 October agreed as the basis of the European Union approach on the subject of the Singapore conference . #% Politically we believe that this Commission is dead in the water . #% Mr Hallam has gone one better than that . #% There are many challenges ahead . #% We had a previous report in Parliament by Mr Hyland , an Irish Member . #% First , the perception that the introduction of the euro has resulted in increasing inflation in Member States has done serious damage to its image , even though , according to official figures , only 0.2 % of the increase is attributable to the euro . #% If this regulation is to achieve legal certainty then the requirements must be clear . #% Many young farmers taking over a holding have to make necessary on-farm investments in order to optimise production efficiency and to ensure the economic sustainability of their holdings . #% I can support paragraph 9 of the resolution on the assumption that the rapporteur is referring to regions such as the Azores and Madeira . #% I believe that the United Nations has a very important and leading role to play in this regard . #% However , the option to engage in forestry activity can also be a very constructive and environmentally friendly mechanism for farmers to increase their existing income . #% I simply can not understand how , after all the years of experience , this continues to be the case . #% This is clearly a situation in which people who are defending the universal declaration of human rights are being denied the right they are guaranteed under that declaration to leave and to return to their own country . #% The clear scientific evidence is that climate change is real , is happening now , and will get worse . #% Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I should like to join with other speakers in commending the excellent work of the rapporteur , my colleague Mr Brok . #% In short , we should not be revisiting the same old problems when we have this debate . #% Through their pain , sorrow and search for justice they have united people across countries and political divides , including those who have had no involvement in any form of politics but can empathise with the pain and suffering of a family . #% The report also calls on the ECB to monitor closely developments in the use of the euro as a reserve currency for central banks and , in the context of its annual report on the international role of the euro , to quantify and analyse the effects of this , particularly as regards exchange rates . #% We must encourage enterprise , we must facilitate enterprise but we must also at the same time have a sense of social justice and those two , so to speak , must go hand in hand . #% We depend on democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law . #% Commissioner , you know that this is not the case , that we are ready to help developing countries in any way necessary as we are helping applicant countries , that we have science on our side and that we will not abandon our hard-won progress - why should we ? #% 
The Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has come to very useful conclusions here and its report should have been taken before this debate . #% These journalists were covering social justice and environmental issues . #% Those who claim that movement towards membership will induce Turkey into full democratic and human rights compliance are shown , even by the lack of appreciable progress conceded by this report , to be lamentably wrong . #% Of these , four have been turned down and 11 have been approved . #% Have states en route also the right to be informed and by whom ? #% We have not allowed enterprise in Europe to unlock itself and to deliver the goods . #% Now I would like to turn to the second report on the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain for the adoption of a Council framework decision on accreditation of forensic laboratory activities . #% The Commission ' s communication on strengthening environmental integration within Community energy policy is very welcome in view of its realistic approach to the question . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , I will deal with just one of your four key priorities : stronger policies to promote job creation and demand for labour . #% I find it amazing that only three states have actually applied . #% We have a procedure and that is that we should proceed now to questioning in depth . #% This year we have heard in Ireland , as is obvious from the concern expressed by Irish colleagues here today , of the danger facing Father Brendan Forde , a Franciscan working in the small village of La Ùnion who has chosen to remain with his parishioners at considerable danger to his own life . #% However , as many speakers have said , despite what the Council may say about the importance of education and despite the Commission 's good faith regarding lifelong learning , there is a lack of commitment on financial resources . #% With certain necessary changes , we have almost got it right . #% As regards the proposals for agricultural spending in the coming year , I note that the preliminary draft budget adopted by the Commission leaves a margin of EUR 2.3 billion under the ceiling agreed by the financial perspective . #% Whereas the European Commission has called for graduated taxes designed to penalise carbon dioxide emissions , the European Parliament calls for the focus to cover all pollutants and fuel efficiency . #% Restricting pornography that uses or targets children should not be seen as an affront to true freedom . #% As soon as we receive notice of any petition relating to the abduction of a child , generally a parental abduction , we telephone the parties concerned so that immediately they are aware that somebody in Parliament is directly responding to their concerns . #% We can not continue to allow the situation where people are so desperate that they will do anything and even put themselves and their children at risk in order to find a new life . #% A one-year grace period during which the home country insurer would be obliged to continue cover is perfectly reasonable . #% I want to ask him : Is it the intention of the Council to agree to the final statement on the association agreement when it arises in October or November ? #% If you cut the ability of the working class to purchase goods and services , then you cut demand for those goods and services , which means you cut millions more jobs of workers who would provide them . #% Thirdly , we are in favour of ensuring that we can give the best education and the best tools of knowledge to our young people to guarantee that they can make informed decisions about their own personal lifestyle . #% In terms of accountability , has the Commission sought a report from Europol on its apparent failure in detecting and impeding the progress of three international terrorists who fled as fugitives from justice in Colombia , before publicly appearing last month within the European Union , in Dublin ? #% We in Europe are certainly not immune to economic downturns in the United States . #% Some of these initiatives have been more successful than others , but in general , it remains the same social groups who make up the overwhelming majority of third-level students . #% Last June 150 countries adopted a global UN strategy to tackle the worldwide drug problem . #% All the sacrifices they made were argued about before , but now all those sacrifices were in vain , because the Commission now takes a different line and says the box has got to go . #% I admire the way that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies has engaged with Northern Ireland . #% There is great potential here for an expression of will from Parliament . #% The principal of that school was earning the equivalent of EUR 150 per month . #% People are alive today who would not be alive if this programme did not exist . #% From an institutional viewpoint , it is important that there is equality for smaller Member States with regard to representation on the European Commission . #% There will be growing impetus for companies to invest and evolve in terms of research and development and substitution plans . #% Do not keep from Parliament information that it should rightly have in its oversight role . #% It is unacceptable to ask us to pass this legislation -- but we have no choice , because of the time frame -- without a proper and full impact analysis , as many colleagues have requested , particularly in relation to bans . #% That too means we should come forward earlier , and not later . #% We do not need to be first among equals , but we assert the right to be treated as an equal among equals . #% I completely support a fully effective ETS , as do all my colleagues , but the system is not working well . #% This should also apply to the coast waters of the Irish Sea which are already dangerously polluted with radioactive waste . #% As the managers of the fund themselves acknowledge , the European Union 's contribution represents a major international recognition of the efforts by both the Irish and British Governments to seek a peaceful solution to the Northern Ireland conflict . #% It is about time the Commission clipped the wings of British Nuclear Fuels ' nuclear ambitions as it expands its empire to the United States . #% By facilitating at long last the formation of European cooperatives and guaranteeing the involvement of workers at board level in such new enterprises we will be sending a positive message to the cooperative movement . #% It is worth noting , at the same time , that trade in agricultural products represented less than 6 % of total global trade in 2000 . #% The very fact that Ireland is currently experiencing an unprecedented economic boom must mean that we do not forget our humanitarian duty to others . #% However , if one reads the report , I would put it to the Commissioner that the plainest message that comes from the report in respect of Italy - and this is the major sensitive political question for next year - is that it gives a clear economic policy message that the one-off adjustments in the budget are masking the need for further economic policy change . #% When the Gargani amendments failed to pass , I voted in favour of Amendments 319 and 358 by Niebler et al as a damage-control exercise . #% It is an attack on the CAP and is effectively a move to renationalise agriculture policy . #% This is particularly so where efforts are made to cross-reference scientific data with fisheries observations . #% I fully support the Council proposal to delegate the implementation of 80-85 % of the budget to national agencies and so I have voted against this Report . #% Stop digging ! #% Ultimately , however , this Commission was the author of its own demise . #% It is not , and I think that he was very ill-advised to add this discordant note to an otherwise more or less acceptable report . #% in writing . - I just wish to raise one particular point regarding cooperation on taxation between Member States . #% Its separation from other EU norms is also highlighted by Euratom having its own framework for its research programme . #% We need more education programmes . #% This is now a very good report . #% In those circumstances , I understand , considering that this is a market which has traditionally been supplied with Irish beef , that this is a deliberate discriminatory act which has been declared and confessed by the people concerned . #% I also welcome the recognition of the international community 's responsibility to protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity , as well as the clear responsibility of each individual state to protect their own citizens from these crimes . #% We do not think that having one specific programme with one management will lead to transparency and adequate monitoring . #% We have failed , in my view , to communicate Europe . #% I welcome the ongoing efforts to reform the institutional structures of the Union , which I hope will simplify the decision-making and administrative systems of the Union before enlargement to the East . #% The effects of the dramatic drop in the price of milk in 2009 were compounded by the EU 's inability to react swiftly enough to the situation . #% The Laeken summit last weekend had to address a whole series of wide-ranging political issues . #% So how does the Commissioner reconcile that with just getting rid of all these jobs in one fell swoop ? #% As I pointed out when I spoke earlier in this debate , he has also promptly responded to those who have petitioned Parliament . #% 
As was agreed last December , and has already been mentioned here , it is imperative that Burundi enacts a stable and real cease-fire between government and rebels as a precursor to a meaningful and lasting peace . #% The vast majority of people even in the border area of Southern Ireland have no aspiration to intimidate the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland into a United Ireland . #% It should try to pull the Member States along , because the Member States are being dictated to by the industry . #% Hong Kong failed to make any substantial headway on the liberalisation of the international trade in services or non-agricultural market access . #% The average aid pledges to Bosnia , Kosovo , East Timor and Rwanda were approximately $ 250 per person , as against $ 75 for Afghanistan . #% She has now given birth to her baby and is out on temporary bail . #% This also includes - as the Commissioner can confirm - the possibility of reviewing Article 9 in the light of the findings of that group . #% In fact the dose could be 12 times more dangerous for children according to the recent study . #% Mr President , the Commissioner is working under the constraints of the undemocratic and anachronistic Euratom Treaty . #% Since there is no real future for the reprocessing of nuclear waste , Commissioner , do you not agree that it is time , and that there is justification , for the closing-down of Sellafield ? #% On the matter of the vote , you have given the correct interpretation . #% In line with our traditional policy of military neutrality , Ireland is not bound by any mutual defence commitment . #% I look forward to working closely with the Commission in ensuring that more EU regulations and directives on this subject are implemented in the near future . #% I fully endorse the statement that violence and peace can not coexist . #% European Investment Bank external lending to developing countries must be focused on investments which contribute to eradicating poverty , and has to turn away from tax haven-based companies . #% It was met , of course , with a predictable grovelling response by the majority in this House . #% I share the broad concerns that the present system of rotating presidencies may not be an effective model to operate in a Community of 25 Member States , but I strongly believe that more discussion is certainly going to have to take place on how the European Council is going to carry out its business in an enlarged Union . #% By his own standards , Mr Milosevic has learned the lessons of Bosnia and is applying them . #% Of course , these scams represent no value whatsoever to the consumer or businesses . #% Now that the Commission has recognised that the policy content for development cooperation must be established by codecision , it is time for it to submit formal legislative proposals on geographical and thematic priorities , so that Parliament and Council can finally start the process of legislating . #% Honesty : telling the truth even when it is not comfortable to do so . #% I submitted a statement in writing at that time on the issue of Mordechai Vanunu , who was released from jail in Israel yesterday after 18 years ' imprisonment . #% In the context of this debate , I am taking the opportunity to raise what is , mercifully , still a relatively small area of activity which has in recent years been criminalized . #% The US , a front runner in the field of biotech Industry is itself dealing with the difficulties of rapidly progressing GM food production sector where private sector involvement has lead to a market place dominated by global companies and the devastation of small producers who can not compete with ` corporate ' farming . #% Developing countries ' perception of our good faith , good will and sincerity towards them will be tested by our attitude to these two issues . #% I would , however , like to take issue with the rapporteur 's insistence that a reform of the common agricultural policy is a necessary part of the process of integrating the developing countries into the world trading system . #% When you talk about such things it is difficult to believe that they can happen but without monitoring or checks you can not be quite sure that they do . #% An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation . #% The Spanish Government is also going to set up the Convention in March this year to look at the development of the future of EU policies within the Union in the context of the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 . #% These regions , which had so much invested in the Moroccan agreement , must be offered real alternatives as quickly as possible . #% We must remember , in terms of immigration , that mercy and tolerance must be our first preoccupation . #% These are real issues raised by EU citizens themselves , and we ignore them at our peril . #% The Commissioner is certain pioneering a very practical approach to agriculture and rural development . #% However , I am pleased that the PEACE programme is being extended and would be grateful for strong support for this symbol of EU commitment to all the people of Northern Ireland . #% What we are talking about here is that the Internet would be forced to put facilities in place so that the police can come in through the back door . #% It is not enough to say that sometimes , as the President-in-Office said , the Council can not prevent occasional shortcomings . #% Mr President , many of you this week will have noticed the exhibition about the work of Herman Hesse in the Spinelli building . #% Since 2001 , EU fishermen have removed hundreds of tonnes of rubbish from our seas and returned it to land where it is collected and disposed of responsibly . #% It will not be in the interests of people , despite what you are trying to say here . #% Due legal process is the sometimes long-winded tool for attaining justice . #% We can achieve this by reaching an agreement between all contracting parties at the level of the World Trade Organisation . #% We should have the courage of our convictions and I hope that the Commissioner would respond positively to the proposal that there should be an office in Taiwan sooner rather than later . #% It is regrettable that there is such a mad rush to finalise this by May . #% We must arrive at some form of genuine cooperation between the courts ; there are a great many areas in the legal systems in all of our countries that need to be carefully reassessed in the light of this very difficult and growing problem . #% I think you should be more balanced and should observe the order that people indicate . #% For example , it put MEPs on an equal footing with national parliamentary representatives in the matter of various allowances and expenses . #% But this is not the vital and fundamental issue . #% The criteria to be agreed must therefore be adaptable and flexible . #% The Council 's proposed ELVs could be met by primary means at a much lower cost . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group I want to note the elements of agreement and disagreement with the emphasis placed by Mr Metten in his analysis . #% What steps can be taken to make sure that the Kyoto Protocol remains the firm basis for future negotiations and action to reduce emissions ? #% I am glad to be able to tell you the person tested negative . #% Members have already stressed the compatibility of incorporating strong social progress criteria in award procedures while respecting the principles of competition law and of equal treatment and non-discrimination . #% The full benefits of biotechnology will not be manifest unless public trust and approval are first secured . #% In Ireland , insurance companies trying to operate in other Member States have highlighted problems to me , such as different rates of tax relief on premiums paid to locally established insurers ; the requirement to appoint tax representatives - fiscal representatives as they are called ( we are not familiar with this notion and most companies do not have to appoint such agents ) - and to fill out detailed questionnaires ; there are also the problems associated with different rules on languages , and finally , there is the vexed question of minimum policy terms . #% I thank him very sincerely for what he has contributed , and also his colleagues in the Commission . #% But let us look beyond the borders of the European Union . #% In 2003 , total emissions from flights into and out of the EU 25 Member States contributed 3.4 % of CO2 emissions , which was equivalent to 0.5 % of worldwide emissions in this area . #% The European Union , the United States and other world powers , however , in their criticism of human rights violations in China , are very soft . #% We must be determined to win this battle so that we will have a Treaty which will govern the European Union for the next 25 years . #% In consequence it exudes imbalance to the point that it will bring comfort to terrorist and anti-democratic forces . #% Mr President , Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon 's recent remark that he regrets not having killed Yasser Arafat in Lebanon in 1982 is unforgivable . #% It has also favoured terrorist prisoner groups over victim groups , who exist as victims because of the horror visited upon them by those terrorists . #% If we include this , then many of my colleagues who have reservations , will vote yes . #% Looking at the countries that will join EMU from the beginning , it appears that the countries on the outside may suffer punitive actions . #% I have many reasons for saying this , but time allows me to mention just one today . #% 
EMU must meet the needs not only of central bankers but also of the millions of unemployed throughout the Union . #% I also join in the expressions of regret and sympathy in respect of ETA 's very many unnecessary victims . #% Every time the Northern Ireland fisherman goes to sea , he has to factor in the risk of savage penalty if he seriously infringes the CFP , but , according to the Commission 's figures , the Republic of Ireland fisherman in the same waters has no worries at all . #% For all nations , but perhaps smaller nations in particular , cultural identity is very important . #% I thank him for his commitment and belief in both these directives . #% The committee is simply paying lip service to the idea and continuing with business as usual . #% We are balancing the books but our workers are paying the price . #% This marks a fundamental democratic deficit at European level and in the wider international context . #% It is important , for example , that we recognise the languages of the new Member States . #% There is a serious loophole in relation to where weapons go , who uses them and what the end consequence is . #% I think that is a slightly different question from the one you have been answering . #% Rather than repeating what has been said already , I would like to deal with three particular points . #% I would strongly urge the Commission to consider it favourably as we now live in a global network with a global economy , global companies . #% In the name of the peace-loving majority in Northern Ireland , I take this opportunity in this international forum to refute and reject that vile attack upon those I represent . #% So we have to take a really serious look at what we are talking about here . #% I believe that it will not be acceptable to this Parliament , or to the people of Europe , for deals to be done , behind closed doors , which seriously damage the coherence , the values , the objectives and the capacity to act that the current text provides . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , the DCI , the European Union 's Development Cooperation Instrument , is a powerful tool . #% I earnestly call for an awareness programme to be put in place to alert non-Irish nationals on this issue . #% Enlargement can go ahead without the Nice Treaty . #% As one of the leaders and front runners for enlargement , it has proved itself capable of throwing off the yoke of totalitarian communism and building a new market-based economy , creating new opportunities in education , improving its infrastructure and industrial capacity and developing its tourism and agriculture . #% But to leave this objective in the report completely contradicts what we believe to be an ethical policy on arms . #% One success story in recent years has been the growth of the salmon production sector . #% The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is now warning that some 13 million people are threatened with starvation over the next six months as a result of food shortages brought about by adverse weather conditions and flawed government planning . #% The Commission 's Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection published a paper last year on the state of mental health in the European Union . #% There is a failure of implementation , not a failure of regulation . #% I believe we should draw clear guidelines for the acknowledgement and publication of the very important financial contribution the European Union makes to human rights and development of the third world . #% So I would pose the question : how can we be confident that a programme to control the fishing effort of a large and powerful fleet would be successful ? #% Having worked so hard to create this powerful federal monetary capacity , we must not dissipate its international effect by an absence of vision and will . #% This is a domain of severe under-achievement in the European Union . #% Particularly since 11 September it has been increasingly inevitable that such an act should take place . #% Its arrogance in relation to its treatment of Falun Gong practitioners and dissidents also can not be tolerated . #% The people have spoken and we have to accept their verdict . #% This is especially true in the context of the nothing-is-agreed-until-everything-is-agreed formula with a deadline set for next March . #% Rural villages quickly become dormitory towns with no sense of community . #% This purpose is achieved by ensuring that laboratory activities are accredited by the accreditation body to comply with international standards . #% A strong competitive and stable economy is essential in order to deliver sustainable growth and a better quality of life to the citizens of Europe . #% The only criticism I have of that section of the reports is that I do not feel there is enough flexibility built in to ensure that the so-called standby or waiting period is taken into consideration . #% There is a need for the European institutions to act coherently and to give the 120 million children living in the European Union the protection they deserve and have a right to expect , which is full recognition of children as citizens of the European Union and nothing less . #% We must act before it is too late to reverse the trend in rising global food prices . #% Mr President , I should like to thank my colleagues . #% And yes , let me endorse your point about agriculture in the developing world : it has been neglected for far too long . #% Firstly , Amendment No 7 which would have explicitly respected human rights for all was rejected . #% Nobody but a fantasist would suggest such a thing . #% Secondly , there is a vast wealth of experience and knowledge of different systems , of different methods of employment and employment policy within this Parliament . #% Internet service providers have a role to play in this . #% In the first year , 2005 , the actual carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries were 44 million tonnes short of the amount of CO2 emissions permits allocated by the 21 governments in question . #% This reputation for angling also has a vital impact on tourism in many parts of Ireland , both from within Ireland and internationally , with Tiger Woods one famous regular patron of the Liffey in County Kildare . #% I understand considerable work has been done on laboratory-based blood tests for TB . #% What we are seeking is decreased administrative burdens , a more balanced proposal and fairness for all . #% Mr Verheugen , who is here today , played a central role at one stage , a number of years ago . #% Mr President , in passing laws which affect people , trade and places , we all have a duty of care and a duty to care . #% Foremost amongst these basic structures was , and still is , the principle that each country should have representation at decision-making level in all the major institutions . #% We either all comply with the rules or we do not . #% Can we not do better ? #% In addition , I am pleased that she has referred to discards . #% in writing . - Aviation security issues are of the utmost importance to our safety and need to be dealt with in a swifter manner than has so far been the case . #% Was it the condition or type of vehicle ; was the victim the driver , a passenger or someone walking along the road ; were drink , speed or bad weather conditions involved ; what was the road like ? #% I hope that all MEPs endorse the demand now being made by Socialist MEPs and agree to the Committee of Inquiry being established immediately . #% Madam President , President-in-Office , President of the Commission , Ladies and Gentlemen , on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group I should like to begin by acknowledging and congratulating the minister on the considerable number of actual results achieved by the Swedish presidency already , even before it formally concludes its work . #% Firstly , concerning fishermen , there is some attempt to compromise within the proposals before us . #% Yes , we debate it here , but realistically we can change nothing . #% The proposals on agricultural reform , while an improvement on the original Commission proposals , are not a long-term solution . #% The Irish army was stationed in Lebanon for many years as a peacekeeping force , and there is a great affinity between the Irish and the Lebanese because of this . #% Our rail system has been improved in recent years but still requires further development in rolling stock . #% But this is unrealistic . #% We all condemn unreservedly the dreadful events in both Palestine and Israel . #% 
We are delighted that the amendment to limit the European Union ' s financial participation to 50 % was rejected by a large majority . #% It is not therefore entirely correct perhaps to attribute to the free movement of people the extent of the problem which exists . #% Unfortunately , the Commission action plan does not go far enough in this direction . #% I welcome the strong support from EU governments for closer cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs . #% One of the ways to ensure that women are liberated , have rights and know their rights , is through a proper education system . #% It is what happens in between the summits that matters , and I urge you , Commissioners , to use your legislative powers and your monitoring ability to ensure that what was said at Johannesburg , even if it is not enough , is carried through . #% In relation to Cambodia , the motion calls on the authorities to engage in political and institutional reforms , to release political prisoners , to combat corruption , deforestation and displacement of people and to take measures to combat the sex tourism industry . #% The rapporteur refers to the experience of Scotland where local authorities take a lead in planning with other partners and this has been positive . #% Our big problem lies primarily with countries that have religious courts - but not exclusively . #% Many animal welfare groups that are very concerned about this have contacted me . #% Far too often in the past we have seen costly development plans collapse because of environmental considerations that were not addressed at the initial planning stage . #% the interlinking of internal policies with terrorism results in the elimination of the inter-pillar structure , bringing forward the logic of the draft EU Constitution . #% It is a matter of some regret to me that the death rate in Ireland is something over two and a half times the EU average per thousand of population . #% It can no longer simply be argued that this is an internal matter for the British . #% As he said , we now live in a world that is totally interdependent , and the problems of one country are problems for all of us , problems such as poverty , hunger , disease , ecological disasters and crime . #% I refer in particular to the concern about the very sensitive sugar beet issue . #% There is a similar lack of openness in the so-called independent review of submitted projects to this programme in Euratom . #% Much as I appreciate that speech , I am somewhat disconcerted by Gordon Brown 's annual address at the Mansion House last night . #% In the Republic of Ireland we have been fortunate so far in that the outbreak has been confined to one area close to the border with Northern Ireland . #% They now seem to specialize in putting new obstacles in the way and of course the latest one is meeting the EMU convergence criteria . #% The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there . #% While I recognise that there were problems with China and Russia , I can not help but feel cynical when I compare and contrast the UN response in Kosovo with its response during the Gulf War . #% We require strengthened monitoring and a reinforcement of current eradication measures . #% We have to take responsibility for that . #% As regards the representatives of the Spanish presidency , it is right and proper that they are here today and I thank them for coming . #% All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected . #% They urge companies to sign up to directory services which are presented as being free of charge . #% I am fairly sceptical about whether or not ITER will proceed within this framework programme , but we will see . #% What are we building up for our children and grandchildren ? #% In other words , if you ca n't put a spoon of the stuff in your cup of cocoa at night then you should n't be feeding it to the pigs either . #% The whole issue of ECHO should be looked at seriously . #% Mr President , the ever-increasing threat from terrorist organisations , and the greater concentration of terror in the murdering of public figures , with the recent hideous murder of one of the Netherlands ' leading politicians , make this matter one of vital importance today to Parliament . #% The Chernobyl disaster changed the public perception of nuclear energy , and many of those who live in the shadow of nuclear power plants are apprehensive about current levels of safety . #% In Ireland car users utilizing mobile phones when driving can be prosecuted for careless driving under the Road Traffic Act of 1961 . #% I would draw Members ' attention to Amendment No 7 where we lay down guidelines allowing non-hazardous waste and inert waste to be excluded from the scope of the directive . #% I would firstly like to make my key point and then we can discuss the wider issue . #% There has been much talk in national and international media about the auctioning of third-generation mobile phone licences in Europe . #% Independent and democratically-run trade unions and the right to strike should be campaigned for , as well as the release of all political prisoners and detained labour activists . #% I give the example of the LEADER programme . #% From acorns grow oak trees . #% Their attitude is based on the simple belief that implementing restrictive environmental protection either harms their business activities or increases their financial overheads significantly . #% . -- Mr President , North Korea has one of the world 's most repressive regimes . #% Mr President , monopolies are not acceptable , whether state or otherwise , and we must be careful with the single market not to create new private monopolies in the energy sector . #% It betrays those in Pakistan who risk their lives to defend human rights and democracy . #% In the fight against fraud you proposed a new high-level group to do its work by the end of March . #% The timing of this decision , however , is a highly cynical one , considering that it was made as a smokescreen at the same time as war was declared on terrorism . #% We can not forget that this deal also has a political content , because to the north of South Korea there is a very aggressive enemy , and I think we send out a message as well as to whom we support . #% Regrettably , this has not happened and , clearly , no real single market in insurance exists at the present time . #% I do not accept this broad statement - as in the single farm payment is paid to active producers NOT landowners . #% It also concluded that the siege of Gaza is tantamount to collective punishment of the 1.5 m population , contrary to international law . #% However , on another issue : I should like to know under what criteria you agree to meet certain demonstrators who come here to Strasbourg ? #% We are told that we must get the Council to supply funds for the pro-Constitution campaigns . #% For example , the agreed objectives for the Member States ' combined fleets were so modest that the Community fleet as a whole was already smaller than the overall objectives , even before the MAGP IV entered into force . #% My question pertains particularly to radioactive emissions . #% A false impression is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to the EU markets . #% We hope this will set a precedent for many of the other Islamic countries who do not feel , due to the type of legislation they have -- Sharia law -- that they can sign the 1980 Convention . #% We have an obligation to raise the question of Lampedusa and the appalling treatment of the hundreds of poor and weak people who are deported by the Italian Government to a regime which would not qualify for membership of this Union . #% In some respects , the exceptionalism in this document appears to me to reflect that kind of logic . #% Existing policies on drugs have failed to prevent illegal drug trafficking , which is now more intense and more deadly than ever before . #% It is quite clear that they were wrongfully imprisoned in the first place : they were fighting for self-determination , their human rights have been abused over and over again , and they have to be released , because they have spent a long time in prison for no real reason other than asserting the right to self-determination . #% It is to be welcomed that the agricultural situation has improved , and that experience and the reorganized CAP have created a better and more transparent state of affairs . #% While I am disappointed that the peace talks in America last year did not culminate in a final peace settlement , they were not a complete failure either . #% We have been developing our own health strategy which includes payments and allowances for carers , including carers looking after two or more people . #% Mr Haarder said earlier that there is an exciting debate in progress in the Convention . #% Any European discussion on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base has to have regard to the needs of geographically marginal regions of the EU such as Ireland and their capacity to attract FDI . #% And while Europe busies itself with such decisions , the competitiveness of the global markets will mean investors simply move on . #% 
There are two things I would like to ask the Council . #% It is important to be realistic when we consider the number of issues that our organisation can address within its rules . #% Drugs like heroin and crack cocaine are okay ? #% She is much loved throughout Europe . #% In the context of being your own man it is also correct that you should consider getting your project right rather than getting it early . #% How many of them had such lovely offices as we have here - and we are only here for four days a week . #% President Moi will have to get the message , given that the IMF and the World Bank have already suspended aid . #% A visible humanitarian strategy must be an absolute priority if the Afghan people are going to be able to live through a very cold winter . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the Spanish Presidency for its very professional and successful approach to its many responsibilities and obligations . #% The Greens want to ban many of the more than 600 additives in cigarettes . #% In its communications the Commission announces a number of short-term measures , the extrapolation of MRLs , and medium-term actions such as incentives for industry , more flexible rules for the use of products and the revision of the existing legal instruments . #% The report , which is considered to be one of the best ever on air quality , raises very many serious concerns which I have proposed , as Quaestor , to bring to the attention of the services in the building . #% This is not only injuring people but also adding insult to injury . #% Up to 30 trade unionists have been assassinated in Colombia this year alone . #% If the single currency is not working , why are so many countries seeking to join the new structure ? #% The WTO argument is just an excuse not to deliver on what was originally promised . #% It is a lie that market forces are guaranteeing efficient behaviour . #% We should not use occasions like this to make inflammatory statements about the necessity of reducing the size of fleets that are involved , because of the reduction in stocks , because of the high price of fish arising out of its scarcity in the European Union and the attraction of this type of food for health reasons . #% in writing . - Climate change is a real and immediate challenge that the countries of Europe are facing . #% In the spirit of conciliation that is quite satisfactory . #% Farmers who want to fill out the 100 % of their base-year area are going to have to take that land . #% I agree entirely with what Stephen Hughes has said : this fuels anti-European sentiment . #% My question concerned the absolute destruction caused by the seals in the North Atlantic fisheries . #% The debate we are holding here today relates to the enlargement of the European Union . #% The message we should send out is that there should be an absolute and complete end to violence . #% The issue here is that basically these are overseas territories of the EU . #% Because of the problems of unemployment , in particular long-term unemployment across Europe , we must have preventative as well as curative measures for the long-term unemployed . #% As Commissioner , will you now change your attitude and , at this late date , support restrictions on child online betting , at race tracks , in bookmakers , on airplanes and anywhere else that this insidious practice persists ? #% Natural resources can not replenish themselves in the face of growing demand . #% One of the things we are told about CCCTB is that it will be more efficient and that it will simplify matters . #% in writing . - Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women . #% The Commission and Council have to implement full economic sanctions against Burma and prohibit any investment until the situation as regards human rights violations has been settled . #% It is also quite clear from the rapporteur 's report that this is the case . #% If we in Europe are not ahead of the rest of the world in our ability to create new ideas and new innovations , we will lose . #% It was quite clear from the result that the majority in this House wanted that resolution passed today and it would have been an absolute tragedy if it had been deliberately scuppered . #% In order to meet the global demand for food , it is essential to maintain our current production levels . #% The Commission , in the review of the structural funds , must give consideration to the various regional imbalances . #% The cost advantages that these countries have will not go away . #% These groups are not only in the blockades but they are in the High Court , at great personal expense , and are being threatened by our justice system with prison . #% Mr President , in relation to the vote on the McCarthy report , I wish to say that my explanation concerns the Irish situation . #% I have no doubt that the Irish presidency is only too well aware that its draft document is embarrassingly weak on the vexed question of the veto and qualified majority voting . #% Mr President , I welcome the report we have heard in the Conference ; the sensitive way in which it has dealt with dossiers such as crime , sexual exploitation and illegal immigration will prove very helpful when eventually we have to move into the serious negotiations and the application of the new powers of the Amsterdam Treaty . #% I have been totally and absolutely devastated by some of the stories I have heard over the last year . #% Much still needs to be done . #% It welcomes an Australian proposal to list the great white shark in Appendix II of CITES with a zero quota on precautionary principle grounds . #% I wish to say to my colleagues on the use of embryos : let us be clear , we can not commercialize the use of embryos . #% We will give it . #% Now , however , after the experience we have gained , we can look at this more closely . #% It is our duty to put citizens ' interests first and not the interests of industry or chemicals companies . #% This is one area where the European Union can have a practical effect on citizens ' lives by improving living standards and increasing environment opportunities . #% May God helps us all ! #% There are some areas that people , particularly in business , are well-familiar with , such as the single market . #% This will be the last time that we will ask the EU for funding for this programme , as the International Fund will cease in 2010 . #% Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , President Prodi , firstly , I would like to express my very sincere thanks for the comments that have been made by colleagues here this morning and by you , Madam President and President Prodi on the good news from Ireland on the decommissioning of arms . #% All the precedent case-law confirms that the Court will quash the reference to the subordinate legal base -- Article 95 in this case -- and interpret the whole regulation as founded on the main legal base -- Article 175 . #% I would also like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by the Commission in responding so rapidly to Parliament 's resolution , which called for a general tightening up of maritime safety . #% However , there are some basic differences of opinion which must be emphasized , the importance of which should not be underestimated . #% So even the definition of what is a minority language is something which needs to be examined . #% Is it in order for my colleague to accuse those who are in support of duty-free as unscrupulous , when all they are trying to do is preserve jobs , ensure lower airfares , promote tourism and the retention of essential ferry services . #% Over the years we achieved real control and achieved the possibility to affect the management of the resources of the European Union . #% There is a public outcry in Ireland . #% The proposal was ill-conceived and can only destroy confidence in the whole farming industry . #% We must structure society and family life today in such a way that it allows women to have a second child . #% You have to take more into account the whole question of , not just giving aid , but fair trade . #% We are on course to increase our budget to 1.27 % by 1999 . #% One area remains to be addressed and that is our knowledge of what is happening in the educational systems of these countries . #% 
Since the Whitehead report was adopted in the Committee on Environment , a number of major events have taken place , the most important being the transfer of responsibility for food safety to DG XXIV . #% We went up from EUR 385 million in 1996 to a EUR 5 707 million take in 2004 . #% No consumer , `` as an individual '' or as a company , can be denied the ultimate right to take legal action but that does not mean that this should be the first course of action . #% Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year , approximately 200 000 died in wars . #% Madam President , I was in Uganda in January when some of the abducted little girls who were put into the army by the LRA were released . #% It included clauses on the acquired rights , the so-called ` grandfather clause ' . #% This is a war crime in my eyes . #% By seeking to spread the blame to criminals generally for the monstrous murder of Robert McCartney , the GUE/NGL resolution and the amendment by the Verts/ALE Group naively allows Sinn Féin and the IRA to wash their hands of the known complicity of the members of the IRA before , during and after the murder and should not , therefore , be supported by this House . #% The Commission must respect Parliament 's prerogative and wait until all three institutions , the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission , have reached agreement on the microfinance facility before submitting a draft Progress annual plan of work . #% In my view , Amendment 50 is better than Amendment 57 when it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable contamination of feed ingredients . #% Let us hope that this crisis is just for the short term , rather than the long term , and that we rebuild confidence and consumption . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report and was very happy that it was passed by the parliament . #% The principle of progressive access regarding two-wheeled vehicles would surely improve safety . #% We are not able to access the recycling markets easily and the expense involved is considerable for us . #% I take that to be your perestroika , to match the glasnost which you refer to , but not an everlasting reform , not a constant state of flux . #% This situation has to be tackled because taxes on the peasants have increased dramatically over recent times because of the need to modernise . #% The European Consensus on humanitarian aid , signed on 18 December 2007 , underscores the will of the EU to cooperate closely in this field in order to be as effective as possible , to defend and promote the basic humanitarian principles of humanity , neutrality , impartiality and independence , and actively to advocate the observance of international humanitarian law . #% There are a number of amendments that could solve this problem so we can have a balanced , workable EU law which will not permit backdoor patenting but will ensure that , in an increasingly cut-throat and global arena , Europe 's most inventive companies can have access to patents and challenge US dominance in this field . #% I can assure the last speaker that this is not simply an issue of interest to the Portuguese . #% Mr President , Amendment No 206 is not rendered redundant by the adoption of the previous amendment . #% That is why the setting of a clear date for the deployment of troops will focus the attention on a tight timescale to find a diplomatic solution to get peacekeepers on the ground in Darfur . #% When we eventually have true equality there will be no need for positive discrimination . #% I would urge the Commission to bear this in mind during the forthcoming negotiations . #% If their mandate is changed to support team-based projects , this must not be to the detriment of supporting individuals of excellence . #% Although there is an emphasis on satellites , we need to realize there are tremendous synergies with manned or , more politically correct , peopled activities , which is essential . #% We must also support those groups working for peace within Colombia , which have provided a safe haven for civilians but have recently been under attack from the AUC and FARC . #% I respect the right of each Member State to decide on its own energy policy . #% That says it in a nutshell . #% There needs to be coordination between research infrastructure and regional policy . #% To add insult to injury , the exclusion of these countries has been deemed as necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the United States . #% People have already waited long enough . #% The fact that we have come close to full employment is a practical example of what is achievable . #% The American presence will reassure the Israelis , who rightly see the US as their unquestioning and loyal ally . #% There are two considerations . #% I refer , of course , to the death of George Best . #% Neither Father Cullen nor his colleague were given adequate medical treatment in police custody and both had to be taken for medical treatment at a later stage . #% In this respect I believe the Commission has , on the whole , made a very balanced proposal . #% Yesterday I sought advice from the House after a lengthy exchange of views and then , not following a vote but under the prerogatives of the Presidency , I made a ruling . #% The committee views this with the greatest concern . #% It would be very unfortunate if infighting in Brussels or excessive bureaucracy were to result in a delay . #% Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca for his usual , very cooperative and consensual approach . #% Mr President , I hope the Commissioner appreciates how happy the Irish car buyer would be to see VRT eliminated . #% in writing . - I voted in favour because , though the EU strategy for youth is , by its nature , a wide-ranging and all-encompassing document , it is crucial to reassert that any new strategy must place education at the centre of its ambition and policy . #% A constituent of mine bought a flight online with the notorious Ryanair but when they went to collect the ticket they were denied access because they had an international student ID card and were refused boarding on the grounds that it was out of date . #% So why should we say that it should be reallocated regardless of the reasons for its not being utilised ? #% Following the conclusion of the prosecution case , General Moro , Chief of Staff of the Colombian Army , went on television to call for the men 's conviction , and this before the defence had even summed up . #% I speak for many of my constituents when I tell you that people purchasing houses are worried about whether the interest rate is going down , about house prices going up , when and where , and what the long-term outlook is . #% Final agreement on reform of the CAP should be preceded by a lengthy and comprehensive debate spread over a number of presidencies . #% If we take the Barcelona process , the Middle East peace process , our relations with the Western Balkans , our relations with Russia , clearly there is a vast area of policy to be covered and a wide variety of instruments . #% This is not only an environmental issue and it is not just an economic issue , but also an issue of international social justice . #% Certainly from an Irish perspective , the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996 has proved to be very successful in tackling this area of crime . #% The most important and crucial issue is that Parliament voted quite clearly for a maximum overall journey time for slaughter , which was also reflected in the declaration signed by over 400 Members of this House . #% We discussed the matter of precedents at length and the two precedents were rather interesting . #% In July 2004 , the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision on the Community position , to be adopted on certain proposals submitted to the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention . #% Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients . #% We will work together to enhance the frequency and level of contact between the Canadian International Development Agency and EU agencies responsible for development assistance in order to bring forward common approaches . #% The last six months have also seen a great momentum in the work of the European Union Convention . #% So , by the end of the year , I hope that we will see real progress on issues such as the maintenance of stability in stage 3 , the exchangerate relationship between the Euro and the pre-in currencies and , especially , on the technical preparatory work for the legal framework of the Euro . #% If you want to combat xenophobia and racism , and I believe that we should , we need to look at the root causes . #% I have been told that the EU no longer plans to send out a patrol vessel this year in either the Atlantic or the Mediterranean . #% I express in particular my grave disappointment at Amendment No 27 in the name of Mrs Green and Mr Cot , who removed Article 1 from the Rothley report and ipso facto removed from it the possibility of the Liberal amendment . #% If I do not dwell on this , it is simply because there are one or two questions I should like to raise with you , Mr President-in-Office . #% Indeed , Commissioner Prodi was actually a steering committee member in the eighties at the same time as Wim Duisenberg was the treasurer of Bilderberg . #% The table in my report compares the fishing possibilities offered by the protocol under review with those available under previous agreements . #% We need to know immediately what kind of situation she is in . #% As a matter of law there has been a reference to political parties in the Treaty for more than seven years now . #% 
They have successful experience in this field , and we have a lot to learn from them . #% Therefore the willingness of a borrower to deal with a foreign lender will be determined not only by the competitiveness of the mortgage , but also by the level of consumer protection that will apply to the foreign lender . #% We have an obligation to examine the record in human rights of the people we do business with . #% Joint action to help combat this growing problem could also be taken under the European Union 's common foreign and security policy . #% It has stable democratic structures and the economic indicators are quite close to our Community average . #% There has been empirical evidence to prove that reducing business taxation , reducing the cost of labour , increases employment opportunities , increases real jobs with real incomes and also can lead to greater social benefits because of increased taxation delivery . #% Secondly , the deletion of mobile workers from Article 17 dilutes the opportunity for mobile workers to extend the reference period from 4 to 12 months . #% It is important for Parliament to put down a marker with regard to the Commission 's efforts to draw back prematurely from decisions taken in Berlin , which , in the case of the sugar regime , were to remain in place until 2006 . #% There are therefore grave responsibilities on us all to persuade the Iraqi authorities to give this full and active co-operation . #% The time has come for Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness to produce the people guilty of this crime and oblige them to submit themselves to the will of the courts . #% Why is it always too little , too late ? #% I consider the International Fund for Ireland to be an essential part of the confidence-building process for the communities , alongside the peace and reconciliation programme . #% I have learned that in Brazil the handful of sugar barons who control the sugar industry are licking their lips in anticipation at our proposed reforms , whereas those who service that industry -- the workers and the landless -- are living in fear and trepidation of their situation worsening . #% My point directly follows on from Mrs Eriksson 's . #% You said here today that you intend to have more team work . #% Our hope lies with our children and in trying to ensure that we inculcate in them a respect for the dignity of every human being , male and female , adult and child alike . #% If Burma is admitted the EU must raise its ongoing abuse of human rights there at every opportunity . #% Like Lord Inglewood , I do not believe that the Council has the answers to these problems . #% We need realistic targets as regards the new directives , but the government feels that it can fully implement this directive by 2011 . #% Mr President , I too welcome the McCartney family here this afternoon and offer them my support in their efforts to get justice in the appalling murder of Robert . #% The judgment that this House will make in relation to your work as President-in-Office will be based on how well you advance the European agenda . #% It is strange and weird . #% One point that Mrs Zrihen wanted to make was that the surface area definitions must be re-examined over the next four years . #% Violence may be an outlet for frustration , but it can only worsen an already bad situation and will not solve the problems which lie at its root . #% Reform is nothing to be ashamed of . #% Legislation should be adequate and workable , but most importantly it should achieve its stated objectives . #% Aviation facilitates social cohesion and cultural exchange . #% I would like to raise the specific case of Berhanu Nega , the elected Mayor of Addis Ababa . #% European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings . #% We can not contemplate a centralized monetary policy without a coherent parallel economic policy , subject to appropriate democratic control . #% The lack of trust in the fishing industry in Scotland and Ireland - and it is also true of Spain - is to be regretted . #% Mr President , one of the European Union 's key achievements has been the ability to promote educational cooperation programmes . #% Mr President , I wish to speak briefly on the question of the role of fiscal instruments in the energy sector . #% The reason why we looked for the 1 % of the ESF to be ringfenced for these kind of actions is that we were afraid that if it were left for the Council to decide , no money would be made available to the NGOs and for these other actions . #% The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat . #% Finally , I was quite amazed to hear Mr Newton Dunn cite the RUC as a good example of policing . #% How can you , from up there , see exactly which people are Members and which are staff and what the actual figures are ? #% It is unclear why this was so , but perhaps it is because it requires too much fishing effort because the stocks are in bad condition . #% Nonetheless , there is a need for the Commission to acknowledge in its proposals , as is the case in the communication , and I quote ` that Member States must have a margin of manoeuvre to pursue regional policy goals specific to their situations in addition to areas designated jointly for purposes of Community and regional policy . #% I would like to see a room here where just Members can go to talk amongst themselves in private . #% This can be achieved by improving the construction of various commercial motor vehicles and by setting up dismantling facilities throughout the European Union . #% With regard to the IGC , the failure to reach agreement at the December Brussels Summit is , undoubtedly , a serious setback for the European Union , but it is not a crisis . #% It seems that Parliament does not accept the common definition of a refugee , based on the full inclusive definition , which would cover gender-related persecution , include both state and non-state persecution and take account of the applicant 's fear of further persecution . #% I wish to thank Commissioner Nielson for his reply . #% I regret that the Commission , from the outset , has chosen the political box option . #% Therefore , I can go along with what was proposed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , to ensure that this kind of debate can take place ; to ensure that some of the lies that were told in the past about what was in the Treaty are refuted ; and to ensure that those rightful concerns that people have with regard to the future of Europe are given an opportunity to be aired within a public debate . #% We have heard that case being put here this morning , with Mr Allister of Northern Ireland arguing for a reversion to 19th century absolute sovereignty . #% He has also , for many countries who do not have a tradition of Ombudsman , brought the role closer and explained it to the people - which was very important . #% What will be the situation in relation to headage payments . #% I hope that is not the case and I applaud Romania where it has made improvements , but much remains to be done . #% It is also clear that Sweden and Denmark will accede to the single European currency regime over the next couple of years . #% Indeed , this experimentation , under the guise of ` therapeutic cloning ' is already patented , and the object of ongoing research . #% In my own country of Ireland , we have one of the lowest ratios of neurologists to patients : 17 , where we should have a minimum of 39 , a fact that negatively affects the outcome for Irish patients . #% It is a difficult pill to swallow that having blatantly disregarded international management of the mackerel stock and , in 2010 , declared a catch of 100 000 tonnes , Iceland has the freedom to export its entire mackerel catch into the EU . #% In the time available it is not possible to evaluate the proposals other than to say that the status quo is not an option , the bottom line must be a sustainable profit margin for farmers , and we need assurances that , whatever the outcome , they are fully protected in the context of the WTO talks . #% I am astonished at some of the opposition to the idea of binding legislation because it is essential to secure adequate funding for integrated coastal zone management initiatives across Europe . #% In terms of agricultural policy , for example , abolishing all market support and protection would remove about two-thirds of EU farmers from the land . #% I just wish to ask the Commissioner about another aspect of looking at unemployment criteria . #% Defensive and frustrating action is possible with shareholder approval . #% I must stress firstly that Parliament , in my view , should not be under any pressure to sign up completely to the proposed first-reading text in this regard . #% Could I appeal to you , Mr President , to consider , when Commissioner Palacio brings forward her nuclear package this autumn , that the very least that should be afforded to us in this Parliament and in national parliaments is the right of communication and consultation and full discussion on these matters , so that all our views for and against such issues can be properly aired . #% What did they know about sanctions ? #% Hopefully , very soon , we will be able to return to a more stable market . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by complimenting Vice-President Gutiérrez Díaz on his interesting and thought-provoking report . #% It will be no surprise to anyone that the Greens will vote against this agreement , as we do with all third-country fisheries agreements . #% As a Member of the Parliament from the constituency of Connaught Ulster in Ireland , a peripheral part of this Union , I strongly believe in real and tangible representation for smaller Member States within the EU structures . #% 
Fishermen in that area have cooperated fully , as they have this year about the North Sea . #% However , where I would differ from my colleagues is in trying to use strong-arm tactics against the Member State governments by telling them what they can and can not do . #% No one looks for our consent . #% However , those countries will have to deal with the consequences of those negotiations . #% Mr President , PVCs are plastics with a very wide range of industrial and commercial uses . #% I can certainly recommend Amendment No 2 and I will leave it to the judgment of the House as to how we should vote on Amendment No 3 . #% Clearly this proposal is out of touch with current agricultural realities . #% in writing . - These Mercosour talks represent a potentially dreadful development for the future of European agriculture . #% Although this document is far from perfect it is going in the right direction . #% I would not like to be in this building at midnight on 31 December - a mere 43 days from now . #% As you have quite rightly said , the areas and the budget lines affected are those which are closest to the citizens and which , coincidentally , have been put in by the Members themselves . #% The objective would be to ensure that we develop standards to protect vulnerable consumers , in particular young adults and minors , to engender a sense of social responsibility from good operators and investors and to ensure that gambling is not used as a source of crime or financing criminal activities . #% Last night , I was astonished by Mr Fatuzzo 's speech . #% What about the creeping abandonment of the welfare state ? #% Successive Taoisigh of the present government 's persuasion including DeValera , Lemass , Cosgrove and Lynch have expressly stated that Ireland has no traditional policy of neutrality and would take foreign policy decisions on a case-by-case basis . #% It has been a long and hard road . #% It means being conservative when one decides the level at which one wants to maintain a fish stock . #% This body , for example , alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety , is already doing good work . #% It could also fund other essential tools for job creation in areas where our agricultural and fishing industries are struggling to survive . #% The first is the issue of those who invested in Lloyd 's and whether or not the British Government is obliged to compensate them for their losses . #% Only the National Liberation Forces rejected this deal and this group has been linked to the death of the Irish Archbishop , Michael Courtney , who was the Vatican 's envoy to Burundi . #% If agreement is reached for a new European Treaty then we will have to focus on the campaign to ratify the terms of this new Treaty across the 25 different Member States of the Union . #% We want to leave personal responsibility to the individual . #% It has been very interesting listening to the Commissioner . #% It has to be founded , if it is to be meaningful , on mutual respect rather than political posturing or gallery-playing which , unfortunately to date , have attended much of the political aspect of that process , especially in Northern Ireland . #% It is ludicrous to suggest that it is not causing injury . #% I am delighted that when agriculture suddenly becomes food , we debate this very important issue in the middle of the day when people can hear . #% These decisions will affect us all and will affect everybody outside this Parliament : people will not have the right to privacy , and this is an issue that should be raised right across the board . #% Nearly ten million Europeans suffer today from dementia , with Alzheimer 's the most common form . #% However , ' inexplicable ' is becoming more and more the norm in this House . #% We have to look at why they are fleeing from their own countries . #% We should be helping communities and civilisation by putting resources into education , health and other important areas where money is needed , instead of using resources to boost the arms industry . #% We set the framework at European level and , as time goes on , there will be an evening up . #% Some of them have been mentioned already : proposals for satellite tracking systems , ventilation and temperature monitoring , stricter conditions for driver training and a greater number of official inspections in different countries . #% We all know that speed is of the essence in finding missing children , not only through the Internet which , when properly used , can be a powerful tool in finding people as quickly as possible , but also through the mobile phone networks . #% Let me ask you two questions : do you not get frustrated that , when you give such a clear and unequivocal answer , Members do not accept your word ? #% I call on the Council and Commission to assist the work of Parliament and take action which reflects the urgency of this situation . #% I would ask the President-in-Office if he could provide a clear timetable as to when the reprocessing trade will be brought to an end . #% We would like to see the new Member States come in under the same conditions as those offered to Ireland . #% I would like to raise a couple of issues with you . #% I also stressed the need for prevention . #% We congratulate them . #% Irish troops have always served in peace-keeping and humanitarian operations under the auspices of the United Nations . #% That is why it is important that we should support the general opinion , agreed by the Legal Affairs Committee and as proposed by Mrs Wallis , concerning those areas over which there has been some conflict , I take note of what Commissioner Byrne said recently in his speech about the other opportunities . #% Children , as the most vulnerable and defenceless members of society need extra rights and extra protection . #% I strenuously reject any attempt by the Commission to construe the terms of that legal base so as to narrowly confine it to Article 95 ( 4 ) , which outlines a prior notification procedure . #% Those who do not believe in the federal Union foreseen by our Founding Fathers must consider whether they are entitled to bring this movement to a halt and ultimate collapse or whether they themselves should go . #% The guns are now hopefully permanently silent and the economies of Northern Ireland and the border counties of the south are beginning to realise their true economic potential . #% They wanted a greater understanding and a greater knowledge of what Europe is . #% Our citizens expect and , indeed , demand that we do better . #% This resulted in the massacre of 800 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps . #% We are coming to the end of a long week . #% This situation in fact was validated by the World Trade Organisation . #% Article 75 of the Treaty of Maastricht introduced the legal basis for the introduction of Community measures to improve the level of transport safety in Europe , thereby creating a Community competence in this field . #% Without adequate funding for LIFE + , the positive steps to address these problems since the introduction of the current programme in 1992 will be reversed . #% The key provisions - Art. 9 , paragraph 4 - state that a Member State `` shall not be in breach of this Directive '' if a decision not to introduce domestic water charges based on `` established practice does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the objectives of this Directive '' . #% There are onslaughts on farm income from left , right and centre . #% All Member States have faced the same common issues : how to address the impact of demographic ageing or healthcare systems and expenditure , how to use the new technologies for the benefit of the elderly , how to ensure a better standard and quality of life for the elderly . #% We want to see this approach taken in the ACP agreements as well . #% It must strive harder to fulfil its obligations in that regard . #% Countries such as Ireland are to be badly affected by the reform of the sugar sector . #% What I do want to say , however , is that I deplore the attitude displayed by Mr Solana here this morning . #% These disasters , while significant in themselves , may be only a portent of a greater global catastrophe to come . #% Mr President , on a lighthearted note may I firstly say that I am extremely pleased to be here to witness the discovery of the feminine side of your personality , revealed to us this morning . #% Can the Commissioner comment on what the Commission is thinking in relation to those services -- other than the post -- that are offered , and when a decision might be made by the Commission so that there will be more clarity ? #% Experimentation with human genes and more recently attempts to introduce ` terminator technology ' which ensures that crops will not produce reproductive seeds represents a frightening affront to the welfare of mankind . #% 
We feel that an ethical code of conduct on arms exports should not be dictated by the needs of the European defence industry . #% I believe the best way we can help East Timor is to openly criticise our EU partners who are arming the Indonesian dictatorship that has subjected the Timorese to 20 years of murder , rape , torture and oppression . #% Would she also accept that regional development policies and fisheries policies should not be looked at in isolation , but in tandem ? #% We were accompanied by many members of the media , who surely were not also being duped and manipulated . #% But Mr Langen wisely reminds us of the enormous potential for European industry . #% This simply means that the international community must now fully re-evaluate how best it can put in place security measures to defeat these acts of blatant and premeditated terrorism . #% I would also like to pay tribute to the former Ombudsman , Mr Söderman , who undertook groundbreaking work in establishing the Ombudsman 's office . #% Finally , under Recital 14 certain conditions with regard to the average working week are not being implemented . #% Where exactly in the Treaty are the written permissions for these state aids ? #% What you have done here today is damaging to people at grass-roots level and to the political system and to democracy . #% The European Union is now a major source of finance for the fund . #% Ms Buitenweg 's report clearly demarks certain areas to remain part of the competency of each Member State , but progress on a European scale is important to achieve a social and more just Europe . #% Whatever may be the policy of this Union in regard to an open market economy , those people who want to buy home-produced meat should be given the right to know it is home-produced . #% Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years . #% This is not only a problem for the Irish people : it is also a problem for the British people and for the wider European Union . #% That is the only way we are going to get any change . #% UNFICYP was another success , as was the operation of the UN force which assisted and oversaw the end of the Iraq-Iran war . #% There has been a political push forward . #% Many scientists and organisations , such as the Pasteur Institute and the British Medical Association , have called for a ban on the use of antibiotic-resistant marker genes , which do not perform any relevant function on the plants and are therefore completely superfluous . #% Let us make it known that the Regional Fund can contribute to the national programmes , supporting initiatives to fight and prevent crime . #% The immense costs incurred in cross-border trading represent a serious barrier . #% We did have a statement by the Commission for 2000-2006 and that set out certain perimeters within which agricultural spending would be provided for . #% Fishermen must have sufficient holiday time and a maximum limit to working time but I am seriously concerned about the damage to the industry that could result from an inflexible attitude . #% That has not happened throughout the European Union , and we have to do something about it . #% In the Lisbon review , I urge you to correct any faulty -- or indeed accurate -- interpretations of the strategy that have the unfortunate effect of increasing the gap between rich and poor , able and disabled , strong and weak . #% Unfortunately , however , as with most new opportunities , these have been hijacked to a huge extent by people of criminal intent who use them for illicit means . #% If you subscribe to one , you should support the other . #% Failure on the part of some Member State governments to cooperate fully in updating and reporting ` new data ' is unnecessary and only has the effect of undermining attempts to implement effective control programmes as envisaged in the Kyoto protocol . #% There must be integration ; with my country in mind , consideration must be given to fisheries policy , regional development policy , rural development policy and Objective 1 areas . #% We must reassure both customers of electricity and gas - in particular domestic users and workers in this sector - on this point . #% If Member States wish to continue with nuclear technologies , the industry as a whole needs to be evaluated to ensure that measures are taken within a programme which puts the principle of sustainability at the centre of decisionmaking . #% How do UK car manufacturers export record numbers of cars to the continent at a time when exporting is more expensive ? #% That is not necessarily a bad thing , because it clearly indicates that the citizens see the Ombudsman 's office as a port of call for problems they have with European institutions . #% It was never a comfortable directive . #% Ireland considers market access to be of particular importance and will , for example , support the removal of remaining tariff barriers to the fullest possible extent . #% We should try to harmonize the criminal offence of paedophile activities , the criminal offence of child sex tourism and child pornography and there should be comparable penalties for such crimes throughout the Member States . #% While this Parliament is only consulted on this issue , I believe we have found good common ground between the staff of the Foundation , the management and indeed the Parliament here . #% In recent years the key challenge to maintaining sustainable fisheries has , to a large extent , developed into an overly simplistic and polarising debate on whether or not we should have more or less fishing . #% If that focus has helped to improve -- as I believe it has -- the plight of these people , then it will all have been worthwhile , even if it has upset the authorities . #% Mr President , Commissioner , at the outset I want to acknowledge the assistance which I received from the secretariat of the Committee on Fisheries and indeed from the secretariat of my own group in preparing this report . #% We believe that this is unfair . #% We must not forget people with disabilities . #% Many are now close to bankruptcy . #% It is not enough to develop technology . #% It is true that the rule would possibly have allowed bogus health care professionals and those struck off for malpractice to work in another Member State without having to register with the host country 's regulatory body . #% The National Crime Council in 2005 found that one in seven women in Ireland experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical , sexual or emotional nature from a partner at some times in their lives . #% Prospects for progress are bleaker now than at any time this year . #% However , these tax penalties will have a negative impact on families . #% The majority , therefore , in the temporary committee , whose aim it was to draw up ethical guidelines for the European Union , rejects the research funding suggested in the Caudron report . #% The ` shortest route principal ' should be secondary to the ` safest route principle ' . #% The agreement reached in Berlin in 1999 on Agenda 2000 still stands and will be reviewed before the end of 2006 so as to examine the next financial perspective . #% This , colleagues , is not the sexiest title on this week ' s agenda , perhaps , but it is directly linked to the future of our planet and to the possibility of even more devastating weather events , mass movements of people and crop failure . #% Madam President , I very much agree with what Mrs Ferreira has just said . #% Commissioner , will the NGOs that misuse public funds -- and I am thinking , in particular , of an NGO in Ireland whose job it is to work in the developing world , which put up ` say no to NATO ' signs during the last Nice Treaty referendum -- face any sort of sanctions or censure from the Commission , particularly if they are using public funds when they should be looking after Third World issues and development issues of that kind ? #% Not all the progress has yet been measured . #% I hope that an indication can be given by the Council in time for the appropriate changes to be made in the first reading of the 2000 budget . #% Are there dishonest people in the fisheries sector ? #% Fourthly , there is no provision in the Treaties and no place in this Parliament , the Council or the Commission for laying down conditions relating to workers ' pay - that is still exclusively a matter for the Member States . #% The Commission proposals as they stand now , if implemented in their entirety , would have the following detrimental effects on Irish agriculture . #% There is a link - MOX shipments to Japan are under EU safeguards controls . #% We can quite rightly bring Member States under control when they go above and beyond what is allowable as regards assisting industries or assisting employment creation opportunities . #% For me , however , this motion has one main focus : to ask again what happened in Andijan last May and to make a further call for an open and independent inquiry . #% However , the same basic barriers and problems still exist . #% I believe it is vital that the European Parliament does not lose its joint legislative power with the Council on the issue of development policy . #% It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State or indeed the Commission to decide upon the tax policy of Member States . #% I hope that the situation will continue to be monitored and will continue to improve . #% 
In other words , the rest of it must be subsidised for use in animal feed and other things . #% We also want to ensure that multinationals do not dominate in our EU markets . #% I abstained on this report for a number of reasons . #% The fact that the Commission does not have to bring forward legislation to push this issue through is an indication that the way forward is by consultation between all the interested parties . #% I support the recommendation that the voluntary code becomes a legally binding one . #% I want to reassure her that people are interested in the environment but they are not interested in paying for the improvements we all want to see . #% There is now a growing political will to introduce changes to the international intellectual property rights system so that drugs to combat AIDS can be given to those countries which do not have the money to pay for them . #% The issue before us today is a battle between creation and man 's discoveries . #% I refer later on to the Fed formula . #% The Scottish Parliament estimates that landscape tourism contributes EUR 560 million to Scotland 's economy each year , much of this in economically depressed regions . #% Mr President , I want to refer to the issue of salmon prices and thank Parliament for its solidarity on this issue over the years . #% Farmers ' wives know how to use computers and could use them on the farm . #% Specifically , have amendments to the Euratom Treaty , which would provide vigorous scrutiny of the safety of nuclear facilities , been agreed ? #% However , on this occasion , the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lomé Convention Accord . #% What we do must not dilute the credibility of CITES itself . #% The difficulties which occurred - a 4 % possible error in the area of agriculture and a little more in the area of Structural Funds - did not result from the failure of the European Commission to dispense those funds in an efficient way , but from a failure - and it was a small failure - to control the Member States and the European governments and to ensure that the Member States and their administrations had done the job in the way it should have been done . #% At present the financing of anti-terrorist security measures for air transport differs from country to country and between transport models . #% This is very important because many people , when they write , feel that their letters disappear into some bottomless pit and nobody ever finds them again . #% We insist on lowering labour taxes as the counterpart of this tax . #% Mr President , it is very hard to believe that since the historic meetings in Aqaba on 4 June 2003 , 65 people have now been killed in what is a horrifying escalation of violence in the region . #% I refer to the way in which Mr Pasty is being treated . #% Along with his fellow rapporteurs for the Europol package , they have endured a frustrating time negotiating the timescale and legality of the draft Council Decisions . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , I agree with Mr Deva that we gave up certain of our rights . #% There is a need for an independent , centralized European organization to which all missing children should be reported . #% I will gladly provide more detailed information on that , Mr Commissioner . #% We need rules and regulations to ensure that Europe works properly not only for the consumer or business but , most importantly of all , for the citizens we govern . #% We call on the Upper Sharia Court of Appeal of Katsina to respect and uphold the international human rights agreements that Nigeria has signed up to and to ensure that any Sharia law in breach of these rights is repealed . #% I would like to acknowledge the work of the Irish presidency over the last six months and to wish the new Dutch presidency well . #% This is unusually good working together . #% When we look to the future , we look to women like the McCartneys , who refuse to bow down to intimidation and who want , more than anything , to live in a peaceful society . #% The common good that the authority of the State serves is only as strong as the certainty in the minds of its citizens that their rights are protected and their responsibilities are clear . #% Frankly , we need to be a little bit more constructive than that . #% Agriculture , which has been going through a very difficult period , has the potential through biomass to contribute positively to rebalancing the renewable energy deficit within the European Union . #% Mr President , I listened with great interest to the long and sustained shipping metaphor of the Commissioner , who can now lay claim to be a master mariner of sorts . #% As regards the rural development pillar , the Commission is expected to propose compulsory modulation from direct payments and this has also been put forward by Mr Färm . #% Equally , we need to have budgetary rigour . #% -- Mr President , some 15 years ago , as a young academic , I applied for and was offered a post at the Free University of Berlin . #% In Ireland we have had governments which have neglected or even denied our rights , but under the shelter of our constitution , even the most vulnerable of us can demand them . #% It is quite clear that we are setting up a military superstate within the EU with its own arms industry . #% The EU is China 's largest trading partner , after all , and it is our second-largest trading partner . #% In late 2004 , there was one documented case of human-to-human transmission of the ` z ' strain of H5N1 . #% I can understand the anger - if there is anger and I am sure there is - from the Spanish side and from those who have lost their business . #% Therefore , we have no data on a decision to include self-employed drivers . #% I understood that , and Mrs Scallon and other colleagues who are not here have been confused by this . #% The emergency aid voted through will go some way to help alleviate the problems faced . #% I was in Colombia last year with NGOs and I can tell you that the situation there is really grave . #% The Stability and Growth Pact States provide the 15 Member States of the Union with a comprehensive surveillance procedure to monitor their budgetary policies . #% We are told by the United States that the oil reserves after the war will be used exclusively for Iraqi reconstruction . #% I should like to ask him , in relation to competitiveness and economic capacity -- aspects of the Lisbon Agenda -- if he would confirm that he shares my view that structural labour problems need to be addressed , especially when Europe is compared to the United States ? #% They will make this Parliament more meaningful . #% There is a lot of hypocrisy here . #% The future reform of structural funding will bring about many changes to regions within the original 15 Member States . #% We should seek to address the relationship between the European Union and the USA by taking a careful and measured approach , rather than dealing with this very important relationship in a knee-jerk fashion . #% Article 109k ( 6 ) provides for precisely such a possibility . #% We , the EU , could not act . #% I am not aware of a single Member State in the European Union that does not have a regulation with regard to thresholds for the funding of political parties . #% The European Union could therefore play a major role in ensuring there will be no conflict or war in the world . #% Where everyone is responsible it can result in a system where no one is responsible . #% Madame President , many colleagues have approached me about misunderstandings relating to signing-in yesterday . #% I believe everybody in this House would welcome the opportunity to give a very positive and assertive vote in favour of the proposals put forward by Mrs Smith in her report with regard to reducing the transitional period to four years . #% I come from an area in Northern Ireland that has a standard of identification and traceability which is as good as any ever will be . #% It is not easy for fishermen to take on board a closure of their area for such an extensive period . #% However , considering that to date the prohibition of these unwanted sites has not been so successful , what confidence do you have that your proposals will eradicate such undesirable sites from the Internet ? #% I oppose the war and I continue to oppose its outcome and the direction which Iraq is taking at the present time . #% It is impossible to envisage further price cuts without a corresponding increase in direct income support from the EU and the agricultural budget . #% It is obvious that Britain 's first outbreak originated outside the Community , and I now question whether third countries which export to us are complying with the conditions we have imposed . #% 
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament and coming from an economy that has been transformed in 15 years from the weakest in the EU to one of the strongest , I wish to acknowledge the huge role that the cohesion and structural funds have played in bringing about the economic miracle known as the ` Celtic Tiger ' . #% This is all ludicrous and it is completely unacceptable that animals are tortured for this sort of excuse . #% The beef regime is the most complicated of all the regimes , mainly because it has the longest lead time . #% The dissolution of the Hong Kong Legislative Council is an ominous sign , as is the stated intention to restrict freedom of assembly and expression and to alter the composition of the island 's civil service . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is brought up . #% I spoke yesterday about the need for respect and dignity and about all of us agreeing on the principles of what is contained in this draft Statute . #% Madam President , I do not want to criticise but to praise the people who put together this quite extraordinary building . #% If such difficulties present themselves , I would make an appeal to you as President-designate of the Commission , Professor Prodi , please to make sure that difficulties do not become crises . #% People have been badly burnt and the system has failed them . #% I also come from a country where meat production , and in particular beef production , is an important economic sector , because we export 85 % of our entire production . #% Mr President , the next round of World Trade talks begins in Mexico next week . #% We are dealing with cold waters late at night in the middle of December and it seems that only the EPP has the nerve to go swimming . #% The Commission 's proposal is an excellent one and I fully support it . #% As rapporteur , I have consulted widely on this issue and examined every option from one end of the spectrum to the other . #% The amendments will ensure that legislators keep control over strategic decisions concerning funding allocations and sectoral priorities . #% In this context Parliament gave a resounding approval to my report on Regional Advisory Councils , or RACs , as they are known . #% I wholeheartedly support the proposal that Member States incorporate public libraries in their general initiatives concerning the information society . #% This relates to specifically named companies . #% There are a number of areas in which Parliament has clearly improved on the original proposal . #% The report also points out that financing opportunities should be widened , simplified , and made more readily available , using the funding currently provided under the European Social Fund , the Lifelong Learning Programme as a whole , and Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs . #% I returned again this year on Good Friday , and that hospital has not received one single patient , has not received one single trainee , nurse or medical assistant . #% It is a great shame that every time an issue like this is raised with Commissioner Nielson , or raised with the Commission , he passes it off as if it did not matter - as if he did not believe this was happening . #% It is not acceptable at this point for that industry to bear that particular burden . #% The worry that the telecommunication markets in Europe will result in higher telephone prices must not be replicated when gas markets open up . #% The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development recently approved an amendment which stated that the competent authorities in each Member State shall identify a sufficient number of suitable unloading premises and notify the European Commission at regular intervals . #% If we do not agree , having adopted common policies , to give ourselves the resources to ensure that these policies are put into effect , then we are really stretching ourselves too far and we are only bringing the Community and its laws and regulations into disrepute . #% By now , my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice . #% After many exhaustive weeks of informatory preparatory work and meetings , the Conciliation Committee reached agreement on a joint text for the regulation concerning certain fluorinated greenhouse gases -- f-gases -- on 31 January 2006 , which addressed the main points of disagreement between Parliament and the Council , which are namely : the possibility for the Member States to keep or introduce national measures stricter than those foreseen by the regulation ; technical provisions regarding f-gas containment ; reporting and review of the regulation ; definition of placing on the market ; cross-border transport or shipment of f-gases for recovery ; labelling ; notification of measures introducing further bans on f-gases ; and the area of training and certification . #% Agreement on the financial aspects of enlargement has removed the last major obstacle which stood in the way of concluding the accession negotiations with ten countries at the December Copenhagen Council . #% That is why the message from the Committee on Budgetary Control must always be critical and risk sounding rather negative . #% You want the EU to be guided by five major principles : openness , liberalisation , competition , transparency and interconnection . #% If this has been a difficult week for the European Commission , it has been a good week for European democracy . #% Fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve long-term growth . #% I would like to reassure them . #% As a Catholic , I do not happen to share some of his very strong fundamental views on that matter , but we can agree to differ . #% The farmers themselves are in a very , very critical situation , where they are extremely short of food and the excess taxes on them makes the situation even more catastrophic . #% I understand that the Australian Government has been informed of this particular shipment . #% In other words , Parliament 's power of co-decision in this area is important as a tangible example of the way European Parliament decisions can affect people 's lives . #% Mr President , regarding Mrs Lynne 's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building , I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower . #% This draft recommendation establishes minimum criteria to be applied in the organising , carrying out , following up and publicising of the results of environmental inspections . #% We really need to change this . #% And while we are planning our own compensation package , remember third countries like Mauritius which are being devastated by our sugar reform . #% What precisely is our definition , and what are they and where are they ? #% Is the Commission in a position to give us reassurances in relation to the Armagh case straddling the border between the north of Ireland and the Republic , where we have word today of a suspect case again ; sheep imported from Carlisle Mart , some of which have apparently travelled onward down south to the Republic . #% Further economic stagnation of European markets should be avoided . #% They should not be allowed to hide behind the cover of the political movement they claim to support . #% The non-gainful employment of women and men who , for instance , educate children , care for the elderly at home , provide inter-generational solidarity and work for the common good , is still not considered economic work to this day . #% The judgment was clear in itself , so how could anyone consider that the incineration of household waste was the same as recovery ? #% Secondly , Amendment No 11 which was orally amended , was in contravention of the right of the presumption of innocence to all . #% From the perspective of the European Union we must set out exactly the likely future role for the European Union in Iraq . #% Where I have a fundamental problem with this report is in its classification of all addicts as people who are ill rather than criminals . #% We also see the pressures on our urban and rural areas and yet we want to see the benefits of new technology spread right across many of our regional areas . #% Of course , the environmental benefits of renewable energy are obvious . #% Our tourism , and in particular our agri-tourism , are closely linked to the countryside . #% The leaders of the 15 countries presently comprising membership of the EU believe that there will have to be substantial changes to the internal decision-making processes within the EU if the enlargement process is to take place in a structured and streamlined fashion . #% The next report , by Mr Nicholson on cod in the Irish Sea , clearly shows the failure of the present approach to fleet management . #% in writing . - It is now widely accepted that the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy has failed miserably and the situation in the fishing industry continues to deteriorate rather than get better . #% It is now evident that the European Union has come to assume a pivotal role in pursuing peace within the Middle East . #% If the Treaty of Nice is rejected by one Member State it is not valid law , because the proposed Treaty changes do not command the unanimous support of all the Member States . #% in writing . - Europe 's objective is a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East with a two-state solution at its heart . #% I am glad we get a chance to reflect on it and to look at the priorities . #% If Western European nuclear enterprises want to take their expertise around the world that is a matter for them , not for the European Union to support . #% That was important . #% This is only correct and proper in the light of the fact that 11 countries out of the 15 are participating within a common , single European currency regime . #% I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust . #% It was clear that at the start of this year different governments in Europe had diverse viewpoints when it came to facing up to the growing political problem of Iraq . #% 
Mr President , Burundi has been plagued by violence and tension between the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority for many years . #% All of us have benefited from the in-depth and often intense debate on enlargement that has just taken place in my own country . #% It is time to embrace the primacy of the nation states over the stifling control of Brussels . #% We have seen from Johannesburg and from Kyoto and elsewhere that they do not pay a jot of attention to what we say . #% The confidence and trust of citizens , consumers and business in the EU itself is linked to their experience and perception of EU laws and the impact they have on their daily lives . #% It is up to the Irish people themselves to decide whether they want to vote in favour or against . #% I am therefore delighted that the European Parliament rejected this aspect of Brussels ' latest crazed proposal . #% If Lisbon can meet the targets spoken of here today , it will be an important step on that road to releasing the dynamic to which I have referred . #% In 2002 , 60 % of Irish farm incomes were in the form of direct payments to producers which qualify for ` bluebox ' exemption . #% There has been some talk recently in certain quarters that the Commission was considering taking action against Ireland for failure to implement new legislation , which is currently going through the national parliament in Ireland . #% Mr President , this is obviously an important debate and I share the concern of Members who are anxious to support research to enable the genuine and continual advance of medicine and the improvement of the quality of life for the individual and society , while at the same time , safeguarding the dignity of each individual from abuse , resulting from breaches of the ethical standards necessary for the implementation of these safeguards . #% Mr President , I welcome these reports today and their recommendations . #% It certainly looks very bleak at present for those fishing communities . #% That is what the European Community is committed to funding and it is not unreasonable to expect a satisfactory response . #% Mr President , today in this House we have an illustration of the deficiency in the current procedures , with a motion of censure being necessary to try to extract information sufficient to meet suspicions about potential conflicts of interest . #% Indeed , as a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , I have come to expect representations from many organisations across the board . #% If we regard these issues as merely domestic , as has been reflected in national legislation on many issues regarding the family , then we do ourselves and the people of Europe a gross injustice . #% I said that Northern Ireland had been sinned against , both by the United Kingdom Government and by the Commission , as well as by the Council of Ministers and Parliament . #% Always presuming in the first place that the scientists have been looking for the stock in the right areas . #% However , we have to deal with the issue of comitology . #% We in Parliament represent over 340 million individuals across the continent , all of whom suffer from the same problem of unemployment . #% The retention of export subsidies is also a major issue to us , as a major exporter of agricultural and food products to third countries . #% I would further argue for a strict rather than a relaxed admission policy so as to protect the rights of third country nationals by outlining clearly the necessary criteria for admission . #% With the Irish economy doing so well we can not stand by and allow transport inefficiencies to become a limiting factor in that growth . #% We need to bring the people of Europe with us at each stage and we can not take their support for granted . #% But we must ask why the regime of Mr Aliyev is implementing such horrific repression . #% That is the general thrust of the position we have taken in these areas . #% The Integrated Programme is unfortunately , however , not open to all countries in the Union 's neighbourhood . #% I appeal to the governments concerned to reassess their position and to remove any obstacles to agreement which reflect a short-term view of the situation . #% He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House , as well as to the concern of consumers . #% That is not so and we should never allow anybody to say so . #% This agreement is groundbreaking in terms of regulation which will clearly benefit consumers and our environment through tighter safety controls . #% But perhaps he was the victim of a few too many glasses of zero-taxed wine himself ! #% We have to recognise that there is a repair job to be done so far as the common fisheries policy is concerned . #% The behaviour of the United States , not just on this issue but also - and far more seriously in some ways - on the issue of Iraq , is becoming increasingly difficult to understand . #% The issue was brought to a head at the end of 1999 with the expiry of a transitional period for fixing MRLs for established drugs . #% Finally and very importantly , it will also help to dispel the many myths that have grown up . #% Apparently , you did not consult that committee , you went immediately to the WHO and you are still quoting what it considers to be desirable levels . #% On the Irish Box , it makes no sense whatsoever in an important nursery and spawning area to try and increase the number of vessels that are going in there , to open up the Irish Box . #% Major green investment is needed in areas like renewable infrastructure , with more wind farms in the north and solar energy in the south . #% That sense of abandonment has led to the apathy and indifference as demonstrated by the lower turnout in recent European elections and , in Ireland 's case , rejection of the Nice Treaty . #% In conclusion , I believe that much can be learned from an exchange of views between Member States on energy policy , and I support Mr Chichester ' s call for the Commission to highlight examples of best practice in integrating environmental objectives in the energy policy . #% Would he also ensure that all other Member States remove such toys from their shelves before this Christmas ? #% These depend on where you are travelling to and from . #% Such decisions are best left to national courts and national judges who have a wealth of experience in dealing with such cases . #% Releasing political prisoners , ending torture , subjecting the security forces to the rule of law , respecting the rights of the Kurdish minority and other measures relating to the Copenhagen criteria are sure steps to securing the date for accession negotiations . #% Mr President , in discussing this matter I very much welcome the proposal from the Swedish Foreign Ministry that I have just seen today for a goal-oriented action plan for conflict prevention , because as I have said before , we in the European Union should be sending a philosophy for peace to areas of conflict and not just armies . #% Clearly the tens of millions of pounds sterling it is estimated are being taken annually from its illegal trade in laundered fuel is enough to ensure that the political representatives remain indifferent to such criticism . #% She was killed because of her exposés of the drugs underworld and all of us in Ireland were very shocked by this callous act . #% Mr President , today we are debating the difference between reform and destruction , between helping the developing world and enriching the powerful forces in the global sugar market . #% Let us be realistic about what is in this Treaty and what is good and bad about it . #% You and some of your ministers will need to be courageous in standing up to the lobby groups that want to push us down a single road . #% As regards the car-park , I have had difficulty once or twice in finding my car but I found it in the end . #% Our Northern Ireland colleagues know this very well working as they do among the local communities . #% Indeed , Community action which complements national policies shall be directed towards improving public health , preventing human illness and diseases and obviating sources of danger to public health . #% The entire Yangtze valley and its tributaries have been flooded - a region in which 380 million people live , as many people as live in the European Union . #% Although Parliament is seeking a greater role , more involvement in coordination and quicker action , with hindsight it is also looking for more legislation to be put in place . #% Finally , the same situation applies in all of the peripheral countries and regions of the Union and it is vitally important for the success of both the euro and the single market that the good work of recent years should be consolidated through the continued availability of structural cohesion resources until these regions have reached European average levels . #% For instance , in areas such as autism , polio , cancer - breaking down the individual cancers is probably easier to collate than anything else - cystic fibrosis and other generic and genetic diseases , we have seen continuing problems for people trying to give services to sufferers . #% in writing . - I voted to change the 2012 calendar to save taxpayers ' money , to save CO2 emissions and to lessen the disruption to Parliament business by the monthly trip to Strasbourg . #% Mr President , I would like you to take account of the fact that there are many Members who will have to leave for an early flight . #% We should not ignore the reality that a vibrant , commercial and sustainable farm sector is a vital component of rural life . #% This agreement would be a charter for privatisation , particularly in terms of water , telecommunications and electricity . #% They have to manage their currencies in the common interest . #% The British Presidency proposal does not make adequate provision for the enlargement of Romania and Bulgaria and we can only hope that the talks will change that situation . #% I rise to protest at the lack of time given to debate the issue of biodiversity loss during this part-session , as this is Green Week . #% 
Nobody is going to be coerced into anything . #% This whole policy is completely restrictive . #% I regard myself as a citizen of the world . #% Mr President , I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Belder , for his work in considering the raft of amendments linked to this report . #% I would ask the Commission and the rapporteur to try and put in place a system of postal services that will be fair to all , a universal service . #% If the Treaty of Nice is not ratified by all 15 Member States , enlargement will undoubtedly be delayed . #% It is a relatively small amount of money when you consider it as regional aid to fishing ports in any part of the Community . #% The scourge of international terrorism must also be tackled head on , and I agree wholeheartedly with the views and comments expressed by the previous speakers . #% Until we recognize these particular rights we do not have the moral authority to criticize others elsewhere in the world . #% From your answer , Commissioner , I did not get the impression that you were saying you would continue to disburse budgetary support . #% The Irish pound , as one of the smaller currencies in the Union , has sometimes been subject to external pressures which in turn resulted in very high interest rates . #% We can not ask Member States to take a leap in the dark . #% I would like , on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group , to warmly congratulate the Finnish Presidency . #% We need an accountable Europe that makes human rights a core value and brings progress on social and environmental rights also . #% The implications of Amendments Nos 1 to 6 run counter to this policy . #% What Britain is seeking to do at present is effectively to rig the market in its own favour . #% This call for reconciliation and coexistence must be welcomed by all interested parties . #% And of course we must tackle infertility . #% I would support any moves to stamp out this disgraceful trade . #% They would mean thousands of job losses throughout Europe in aircraft refuelling , servicing , cleaning , passenger handling and baggage registration . #% If the boats get faster and if the nets get bigger and more powerful , it is only natural that we should use all the modern technology available to us . #% No joy , no progress , perhaps even no response - I do not know . #% in writing . - I support this resolution which calls , inter alia , on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Member States to work towards a strong EU common position on the follow-up to the Goldstone report and demands the implementation of its recommendations and accountability for all violations of international law , including alleged war crimes , and urges all sides to conduct investigations that meet international standards of independence , impartiality , transparency , promptness and effectiveness , in line with United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/64/L .11 . #% In Silvermines , County Tipperary , a 147-acre , 40-foot high plateau of fine red toxic tailing pond blights the area and in dry weather the dust blows across several counties . #% The holding of democratic elections next year , the establishment of a national army and the pursuit of good neighbourly relations are all positive steps in the right direction . #% I regret that the European Council , while giving political support to President Santer 's proposed confidence pact for employment , failed to agree on the more important questions of funding the measures proposed by the Commission President , thereby ignoring the 18 million European citizens who had been led to place their hopes and trust in the outcome of the Florence Summit . #% The Irish Government 's hear-no-evil , see-no-evil approach to illegal renditions is unconvincing and unacceptable . #% The current development round at the WTO is supposed to give special attention to the needs of developing countries and their desire to better integrate themselves into the global trading system . #% I would suggest that in the light of the difficulties we have had with making Eastern European states understand the importance of energy efficiency , this is an absolutely meaningless document . #% It is the beginning of a debate - an honest debate - that we want to be involved in as parliamentarians . #% The independent producers were very concerned about this directive , and we must recognize and support our young , independent producers , who are already producing some of the best and most interesting programmes out of Europe . #% Ireland was also a party to the resolution and I think we would need to put in an oral amendment , if this is agreeable , to include Ireland also . #% What role does the Commission see for itself in this area , or is it going to be the Member States ' responsibility ? #% The Greek Government must be commended for the measured approach it has taken during this very turbulent time for the European Union . #% I too am a dissenting member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Constitution . #% Can he tell us that ? #% If this discrimination continues then ICBAN funds must be frozen until there is total fairness . #% This is an area which has to be looked at in the months ahead - we must create the confidence within ourselves that we can begin to move forward as we begin , hopefully , to see the back of the TSE/BSE problem . #% However , I want to focus this debate on a flagrant breach of human rights perpetuated within this European Union specifically within the United Kingdom . #% A second institutional issue still to be decided concerns the future operation of the presidency of the Council of Ministers . #% Mr Rothley is to be complimented once again on his wisdom and competence . #% Mr President , Northern Ireland has a very vibrant poultry industry , which is expressing grave concern . #% They are certainly not mutually exclusive , as Mr Walter has said in his report , but we believe it will be nominal and real convergence which will support the European Union 's competitiveness with the new Asian Tigers , Japan and the US . #% I am happy as long as we indicate a preference in timing while being realistic enough to realise that we do not control all the possibilities . #% It should be no surprise to anyone that fishermen will have the greatest interests in this agency . #% And lest anyone should attack me on that , I would like to say that I support animal welfare legislation as well . #% Sellafield is expanding and preparing to take more and more radioactive waste for reprocessing . #% That is a political , not a technical , decision . #% It was asked how we can compensate the developing world for having taken their best . #% We believe the current legal base is the correct one and we join the Commission in their suggestions . #% Furthermore , inept handling of these issues by the respective governments and the EU itself has seriously undermined public confidence in the ability of politicians to deal with crises in the food chain . #% But in the least developed countries , such problems , for which they are not responsible , are compounded by the consequences of food and climate crises , with dramatic implications for a sixth of the world 's population who suffer from hunger . #% Legislation is necessary which not only protects the rights of people with disabilities but also ensures that people with disabilities are provided with support and structures that will allow them to participate on an equal footing in all aspects of life . #% In conclusion , the whole question of financing the enlargement of the Union must not be confined to a narrow accounting exercise but must also take account of less tangible but no less important factors , such as security issues and likely shifts in trade patterns . #% The idea of a minimum target for recovery will to a certain extent force Member States who do not have incineration to bring it in or to use that as an excuse . #% There was definitely a misunderstanding and many colleagues , in order to be here for the plenary today , had to leave home yesterday and incur the usual expenses . #% They are now saying that the state will have to pay it back which is not acceptable either . #% Indeed , in Northern Ireland last year , we only had , I think , three identifiable cases of BSE and the projection for this year is one or at worst maybe two . #% The risk of accidents , with which Mr Seppänen 's report and your draft directive are concerned , has also been strengthened because of 11 September , as has the even more serious security question which is now facing us . #% The policy of non-cooperation which the British Government is now pursuing in Brussels has had an entirely negative impact and must be abandoned at the earliest opportunity . #% It is not the appropriate strategy for the Members of this House to recommend that we should pass our responsibilities on to the national governments . #% Energy efficiency is one of the few obvious contributions towards the attainment of the targets set for the EU in Kyoto . #% In particular , I have been concerned about the lack of accountability of EU-based companies trading in the UK which are able to advertise in the UK , but do not need to apply for a licence . #% It is not enough for us to wring our hands , it is not enough for Member States , as Mr Hughes has pointed out , to oppose the temporary agency workers directive - which provides some degree of security for certain categories of workers - and then pretend that they are going to do something serious about pensions , when in fact they are undermining the possibility for many thousands of people to have sufficient contributions , even for a State pension . #% And I would remind you that disability is , in itself , still an area for development within the EU . #% I am calling on the Commission to intervene urgently to have the construction of this road stopped until a full review is carried out as to why the environmental impact study did not identify this major archaeological site when it was identified by a state-sponsored organisation , An Foras Forbartha , in 1983 . #% 
We could be about to really influence the energy agenda for the year 2000 and Mr Linkohr 's proposal for the right of access for renewables to the electricity network is crucial . #% He cites to me in letters his problems in dealing with the European Patent Office and the litany of hurdles he has to go through to obtain a European patent . #% Paving the way for minimum tax rates or corporate tax plans will not prevent companies from looking outside the EU for more competitive rates . #% In the internal market procedure , why should there be a difference ? #% Aquaculture has considerable potential to support further growth in much needed jobs and economic activity , notably in coastal communities where other jobs are very hard to find . #% The proper forum for dealing with this issue is the WTO , where the EU must ensure that there is a level playing field . #% It is hypocritical to spend EU funds on prolonging the life of dangerous facilities . #% This can only contribute to a greater openness in dealing with human rights issues . #% The technical breakdown in the system should not be held against them when it comes to counting time spent voting in this House . #% We must remember that when the Treaty of Amsterdam is ratified and comes into force it will have an employment chapter . #% If the United States and GM multinationals are so concerned about world hunger why do they not put the resources spent on research and PR for GM into helping them fend for themselves , not into forcing them to become even more reliant on multinational companies to grow their own food ? #% When the Commissioner does that , would he also again talk to Commissioner Fischer Boel about allowing countries in Europe to have GM-free status ? #% The proposal reaches its most ludicrous and unacceptable point when it embraces the progressive financing of the EU by direct taxation . #% I also hope that he will raise the issue of East Timor at some stage as a matter of urgency , perhaps in Cardiff . #% The reason I put a specific request for you to come forward with conclusions or results at the end of the presidency in December is that I was hoping that - linking back to what Mr Hyland was talking about earlier - it would be possible during your time in the presidency to undertake a joint initiative between young people and the presidency to ask young people about the dangers facing them and try and alleviate some of the social problems and issues people face that drive them into the drug culture . #% This is inadequate ! #% In relation to fraud in export refunds -- an issue that came up during last night 's sitting and in the media recently -- one of the ways to avoid that would be to get rid of export refunds . #% With regard to a sense of Europe as Hans-Gert Poettering mentioned earlier , I believe it has been diminished at the highest level through Members of the European Council . #% We in the EU have failed to do that in Ireland over 25 years . #% How , Commissioner , is that historic wrong to be righted ? #% It is for all the other programmes . #% Mr President , it is imperative , when the new euro currency and the euro rate come into existence in January 1999 and when the green pound is abolished , that farmers do not lose out in terms of the value of their income supports under the common agricultural policy . #% I am concerned that , whereas the rate of appropriations from the Community budget for trans-European networks in the field of transport measures continues to be at a satisfactory level , a number of Member States have failed to advance the necessary monies for these TENs projects . #% - The EUR 45 million to the IFI is most welcome , and a continuing recognition of the European Union 's support for the cross-border communities in Ireland . #% I would like to ask you , Commissioner , are you going to push much further with the Irish government and explore every possible avenue . #% I share concerns about citizens being ripped off and the worries about gambling addiction , but note that gambling is controlled in the majority of Member States in order to protect citizens against gambling addiction and fraud and to prevent money laundering . #% The promotion of e-business activities , e-health programmes , e-government and e-learning initiatives under the auspices of the e-Europe Action Plan 2005 is being implemented in its entirety across the length and breadth of Europe . #% However , it is also clear that there have been unaccountable and unacceptable actions within the Commission that have jeopardised the reputation and the good name of the institution . #% The reaffirmation of this commitment at Liège will allow the EU to better address cyclical fluctuations . #% What we have done here today is regrettable . #% The reason I abstained on this report was because there were some positive things in it but there was also a reluctance to deal with the reality of the situation . #% I endorse the call set out in the Buzek report for the continuation of the INTAS programme and for its activities to be funded from the specific ` Cooperation ' , ` People ' and ` Capacities ' programmes . #% America is wrong in its stance with regard to the International Criminal Court . #% A united front , spearheaded by the Union and the United States , will be the only means of enabling us to defeat these cold-blooded and ruthless murderers . #% It depends on information which is given to it by the national police forces , on cooperation with those forces and also on the requests from those forces for it to undertake action . #% With new technology and the availability of more financially rewarding opportunities for young people , let us not close our eyes to this real threat . #% We are facing a situation whereby , on one hand , the world 's population is growing , while , on the other , food production is proving to be an ever more challenging endeavour owing to the negative effects of climate change and rising costs associated with food production . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Belder , and indeed the European Commission , for producing the interesting 2001 report . #% All our Member States must cooperate fully to minimise the risks for all our citizens . #% So please come forward with a progress report , because lives are at stake . #% This effort is being sat upon by a gigantic Norwegian effort - which has obviously been subsidized over the years - that will not allow the flagship of fish-farming activities which is salmon farming to get off the ground . #% In terms of jobs and services , these are areas which could really ignite economies throughout Europe at the moment , given that tourism is one of the growing areas . #% The Socialist Group played a key role in securing $ 108 million for Ireland 's Peace 11 programme for 2006 , and continues to pledge its full support for the programme . #% This allows tobacco manufacturers to continue to plead ignorance of any detrimental effects on human health of these additives . #% Spain , often criticised this House , was one of them . #% There is no point in carrying out research to find out what pollution is related to pollution-related diseases , and what is causing pollution-related diseases , if these findings are only going to be put on a shelf and nothing done about them . #% Also at the outset I want to congratulate Mr Rocard on his tenacity and persistence in getting this report through despite , at times , virulent opposition from certain groups , with myself most virulent and opposed . #% I should only like to say two things , which I already mentioned to the Prime Minister but perhaps President Barroso could take them on board as well . #% Mr President , in Ireland last week we saw the horrors of trafficking when a programme was broadcast on RTE television about young women from Romania being trafficked into the EU , and into Ireland in particular . #% The Union has an unemployment rate of 8 % and the target of full employment is attainable . #% in writing . - The Fine Gael members of the EPP Group voted in favour of Draft amending budget No 8/2009 . #% I am actively canvassing for a yes-vote in the referendum which I hope will be carried . #% We must make realistic estimates of these costs and agree to provide the extra finance in the European budget . #% I have been gratified to have the largest amount of votes cast for any person elected to this Parliament . #% I have some reservations in the context of the negotiations in the IGC . #% We can not pursue design criteria , as distinct from performance criteria , which favour one jet engine manufacturer over another . #% Hopefully , good sense will prevail tomorrow and we will put in place a report that we can stand over . #% An European Union initiative is urgently required in this respect . #% But if Mr Primakov and his administration do that we can help each other out of the present crisis . #% The proposed sewage plant at Galway Bay last year was a typical example . #% I do not think the Council has been particularly active in the past . #% However , like several of the rather aspirational articles in the Treaties , Article 191 , the article referred to , lacks a certain operational content . #% I want to know whether a proposal in the annex overrules the earlier vote on the draft Statute , namely not to have a transitional period . #% Are we talking about Hiroshima , Nagasaki , Cambodia , or even Korea , where I served in the American Army ? #% The parties must move forward . #% I want therefore to read this into the record to once again expose the type of behaviour that Mr Martin engages . #% 
If we can only have answers from the Commissioners who are available on the day -- Mr Monti and Mr Nielson in this case -- then why invite questions to any Commissioner ? #% Certainly the current rules benefit car manufacturers and dealers and disadvantage consumers . #% The overall new policies that we are trying to work towards include a common energy system , where we recognise , of course , the rights of the Member States to deal with their own energy issues , but also see where those individual Member States can cooperate with each other to guarantee minimum resources as regards safety and security , with regard to interconnection and to guaranteeing the proper use of funding for research and development as regards new renewable energies and in particular on biofuels . #% I would like to thank colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control for their cooperation in helping us to undertake the very important work of scrutiny on which our committee , could spend all its time on if we wished to . #% That raises the question , for me , of how we can expect these people to have any idea of what is happening in their coastal areas or waters . #% Despite this progress , much work needs to be done . #% The Kyoto Protocol is off life-support because the Russian Federation ratified it . #% These actions are to be welcomed and , in particular , the extrapolation of MRLs between species that could help to maintain on the market many products intended for minor species . #% I do not believe that the compensation package of ECU 650 million is sufficient , but it is a start . #% I would like to say to Mr Fischler that while his message was not an easy one to sell he made a great effort to explain it to the farmers of Europe . #% We should make this as uncomplicated as possible for the people of the candidate countries . #% Even though I have consistently opposed nuclear power , I feel that the discussion was used by extreme opinion on both sides of the nuclear argument and this ensured that a common ground could not be found in Parliament . #% I do not see either that it is appropriate in this report to talk about 50 to 60 years ' extension of nuclear power plants . #% If there was simple control on access and more passwords on computers themselves , then parents , schools and others would have greater control . #% We must focus on polices which will improve European competitiveness and productivity , while investing more on research and new product development . #% I would like briefly to refer to Mr Mote 's comments : he might be a bit more sanguine about the health and safety regulations if he had once had to gather up the remains of an unfortunate worker who had slipped off a roof and ended up dead on the street below because there was no scaffolding available during his work , and had then to go to the family of that unfortunate man and explain why he was dead . #% It is exactly such local realities that the Commission needs to reflect more and more on the implementation of what is too often rigid dogma on State aid and indeed on other policies affecting the European Union . #% The waste product has an active life of thousands of years that we can neither control nor manage . #% This year has seen strong progress by the opponents of a single currency who have succeeded in raising serious concerns about the effects of a single currency in many people 's minds . #% The importance of containing spending and being careful has nothing to do with denying the needs of the Community in so far as budgetary resources are concerned . #% in writing . - The objective of any waste policy is to minimise the negative effects of waste on human health and the environment . #% in writing . - While it is not a good idea to subsidise the fossil-fuel industry , fishermen across the EU are suffering due to the economic downturn and , unlike other modes of transport , they do not have any real alternative to fossil fuels . #% The Agency , created in 1975 , provides excellent services for the European Commission , the European Union Member States and the social partners , as well as for the associated countries of Norway and Iceland . #% We should never start at a consensus , but we should always end with a consensus and compromise . #% The European Union in its review of the Common Fisheries Policy should take into account the fact that this is a public resource and that a small number of people think they have the right to go out and get rich from it . #% I do not see why I should be penalised if all language translations are not available , and I would ask you to give a ruling , if not today , subsequently , that when a Member of Parliament tables a question in full accordance with the Rules , they are entitled to an answer at the appropriate time . #% It has been agreed to accept the recommendations of the Scientific Committee as the basis for all decisions on the public health aspect of food production . #% Over three million people will die from AIDS this year alone . #% In relation to access to documents , you are making an extremely restrictive interpretation of the regulation . #% According to the respected NGO War on Want , that would threaten a further 7.5 million workers with losing their jobs , including in the poorest countries . #% I know there are particular Irish and Finnish interests here , but I do not believe that we can accept peat as a forest-based industry . #% I quote from the OECD : ' A policy challenge in Europe will be to ensure that simultaneous fiscal consolidation does not have substantial adverse short-run effects on activity . ' #% What solid steps will the Council take to see to it that Member States meet their obligations ? #% It has to be left to some extent to individual countries and indeed regions as to how they work their way through this . #% One of the lessons from SAVE I was that far and away the best thing to do is to bring in binding legislation which Member States have to enforce . #% We are disappointed at the cut from the expected ECU 700m , which of course led to the drawing up of proposals , down to a paltry ECU 100m , over one-third of which is to be spent on BSE . #% We must also impose standards on European firms that operate in the developing world and seek international cooperation to have tough standards and sanctions applied on a worldwide basis . #% We believe the everything but arms move is a good step , although some of us regret the delayed timetable which sends a message of less than complete commitment to the least developed countries in the world . #% We have to recall again that no country has ever been defeated by terrorism and I am certainly confident that the terrorism which we now face on an international scale does not have that capacity unless we allow it by failing to grapple with the ideas underlying it . #% I would ask the Commission to lift its ban on state aids to national , particularly small , airlines . #% I would like to see the Commission push for fluoridation of drinking water throughout the EU to be discontinued until there is a proper , adequate assessment of the situation . #% Marker vaccines to distinguish vaccinated animals from animals carrying the virus will have a major role to play in this area in the future . #% But once one of the free-wheeling states is asked to pedal , then there are cries for equity , for fairness and for a level playing field . #% At the same time , getting legislation right in the internal market is critical to achieving the Lisbon goals of jobs , growth and competitiveness . #% In fact between1992 and 1992 the LIFE initiative cofinanced nearly 1600 projects with a total Community contribution of approximately EUR 2.1 billion . #% That should be respected , both in terms of accepting waste and in terms of the risk of waste being transported through our waters . #% It is our job , the job of politicians , not economists , to try to find ways - new ways and novel ways - of raising this particular issue . #% It makes no sense to require a farmer retiring under the farm retirement scheme to opt out totally of a career in which he has spent his whole life . #% Many must seek further part-time work to supplement their income . #% I support the compromise on registration , together with the amendment to limit the cost for SMEs , and the minimisation of animal testing . #% The dire economic prospects for young people and the anger against corruption and excesses of the tiny dictatorial elite lie at the heart of the revolutionary movements and the aspirations of the Egyptian people . #% Personally , I had understood that was her position . #% Is it not the case that the directives , as they are implemented , would not allow a regulator to reveal confidential information that might dissuade a policyholder from investing in companies with problems like Equitable ? #% It simply can not and never will do it . #% These areas deal with mobility , transparency , publicity and support to researchers and potential researchers . #% Are we doing Parliament justice ? #% Mr President , first of all I must ask why we have two reports at all . #% We now have the opportunity to revitalise the process and bring a positive message to the peoples of Eastern Europe . #% This is a dramatic statement of the need for responsible and moral financial management . #% This is an opportunist action on behalf of the Socialist Group to try to create a storm before the conference takes place in London . #% I would urge you , Commissioner Byrne , to give serious consideration to the establishment of an independent food agency along these lines . #% In this report , which particularly focuses on injury data collection , I have recommended that to promote safety and prevent injury we need better-quality data . #% I support the Commission ' s framework programme to combat trafficking in human beings ; the aim is to develop effective judicial cooperation across the European Union . #% This failure by the Council to assume political responsibility should caution a certain modesty among those in some of our capital cities who seem prone to see the failings revealed in recent days as almost uniquely the creation of the European Commission . #% As somebody who comes from an island Member State which exports 90 % of its production , I am deeply concerned at the lack of mandatory authorisation included in this directive . #% Some # 30 million has been provided for this scheme , which I hope will shortly be approved by the Commission . #% 
I warmly support you . #% Maybe he did not think I was worth coming to see ; I do not know . #% Mr President , in the presence of Commissioner McCreevy and his colleagues , I would like to put down a marker about the Commission 's proposed reform of the sugar regime . #% I want to join with those who have condemned the allegations of rigging in the recent electoral process . #% In conclusion , I would like to acknowledge the fact that the supervisory board called for by Parliament , has indeed been set up . #% We note with pleasure a marked improvement and look forward to reassurance about the safety of nuclear installations in the former Soviet Union . #% A train leaves Brussels at 7.20 a.m. , and we are considering the possibility of arranging transport from Luxembourg , where the train arrives at 10.00 a.m. #% Madam President , incoming members need to realise that their membership of the EU will not remove the great difficulties they already have in their agriculture industries . #% It is not without significance that only when a red-faced Dublin Government published proposals for penalties to deal with this issue that , at the behest of Irish MEPs and others , this oral question was raised . #% She is a lady who I have worked a lot with in the past on the National Economic and Social Forum and whose opinion I have great respect for and whose guidance I would take on many occasions . #% A self-employed driver has many more tasks to carry out and is more likely to be fatigued when first taking the wheel , never mind having worked 10 or 12 hours in the day , so I would strongly support this report and welcome the compromises that Stephen Hughes has reached . #% The Union has come through quite a long period of introspection in economic terms as we have sought to create the required convergence for monetary union . #% Biofuels are in many cases manufactured from organic waste . #% We must ensure that EU firms operating outside the EU treat their employees fairly , both in terms of the remuneration they receive and adequate health and safety standards in their workplace . #% Drugs are the hard currency for weapons and are funding terrorism . #% Madam President , having experienced not just the trauma of BSE but the very protracted and painful recovery until we recently secured the return of British beef exports , none of us wants to see that happen again . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , today we mark another step in the progress of Romania and Bulgaria towards welcoming them back into the family of democratic nations within the European Union . #% Two types of inspections are foreseen , in particular , routine inspections carried out as part of a planned inspection programme and non-routine inspections as a follow-up to complaints in connection with the issue and renewal or modification of various licences . #% For ten years Kosovo has beckoned us . #% We must continue to be very active in encouraging movement on both sides . #% These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , I believe , these talks will not be held up indefinitely . #% After several rounds of negotiations starting in Brussels in January 2001 no agreement was reached between the EU and Senegal on the renewal of the current protocol . #% It displayed incredible insensitivity to the legitimate concerns of the developing world and , frankly , the developing world has little so far to thank the WTO for . #% The issue has stalled there . #% I encourage the EU Member States on the UN Security Council to take a more proactive role in getting Burma on to the Security Council agenda , in particular Britain . #% We will pass a resolution confirming the appointment of the president later today on these terms . #% Farmers ' privilege is explicitly protected for reseeding and breeding animals on their own land , as is the case today . #% We also need to tackle very seriously the brokers of arms . #% We can not avoid the other choice and the real question which is : How do we use a finite resource when demand is increasing and we have environmental promises ? #% in writing . - This report aims to protect those who are unjustly marginalised and ensure that they have proper and adequate means to address their situation . #% As we are aware there is an EU Communicable Diseases Network which has been in existence since 1999 . #% Mr President , the pig industry in Northern Ireland has been hit worse than all the other sectors in agriculture which are already in crisis , as the Commissioner knows . #% Important amendments relating to gender equality in the selection of workers ' representatives , trade union rights and corporate social responsibility have been adopted in committee and I am pleased to hear that there are indications that both the Commission and the Council are favourably disposed towards many of them . #% It is estimated that more than 8 million Europeans aged between 30 and 99 suffer from neurodegenerative diseases , and scientists anticipate that this number could double every 20 years . #% The Commission , for its part , has supported Turkish NGOs and professional organizations promoting human rights for a number of years , including the Human Rights Association , the Human Rights Foundation and the Turkish Medical Association . #% In Holland , potentially lower VAT rates and labour-intensive services produced headlines about cheaper haircuts . #% The city lies at a crossroads between the Muslim north and the Christian south , a fact that has led many to believe that the incidents are solely based on religious hatred . #% Ireland 's per capita carbon emission is 17.5 tonnes per annum . #% We believed Parliament 's amendments unnecessarily watered down something which is a deeply sensitive political issue on the road towards EMU . #% Mr President , I would like to bring to the attention of this House the findings of a visit I made to Romania to look in particular at the situation of babies and young adults with handicaps in institutional care . #% I welcome the proposal before us here today . #% While I agree with the emphasis on prevention targets and not only on the new recycling and reuse targets , I feel strongly that national authorities in each Member State should be free to optimise their own mix of recovery and recycling options . #% Other forms of gambling are limited to over-18s . #% In this growing atmosphere of international terrorism , surely it is grossly irresponsible to continue this transportation . #% The remit of the Committee on Development is to represent their interests at European Union level and to ensure that they are kept on the EU 's political agenda . #% This action must be taken sooner rather than later to alleviate the pressure that has been put on ordinary people . #% Perhaps , as Commissioner Rehn has outlined , we will resolve all these problems by October 2006 , but these two countries must accede . #% We can not lose sight of them either . #% Mr President , I am from Ireland . #% I am not arguing against caution , but the Council expressed views today which were not balanced . #% I should like to express my strongest possible objection to the operation of that veto in the Security Council , because it effectively vetoes , not only the mandate by the United Nations in relation to Sfor , but also the foreign policy of Ireland and other countries which operate in Sfor based on the UN mandate . #% The issue of agriculture : The United States and other countries refused to understand , even though it is a very simple notion , the multifunctional reasons for our common agricultural policy . #% It is the goal of the European Commission and Parliament to reach two million participating students by 2007 . #% The proposal on the African lion is scientifically weak and is strongly opposed by the range states where the lion population is stable or increasing . #% Instead of revising them every year , why not make it every three or four years to ensure again that they can be seen to operate within the mechanisms and systems that they are emerging from ? #% The pretence that it is the developing countries who will benefit is totally erroneous . #% That is my approach in the report , which the Committee on Environment , Public Health and Food Safety strongly supported . #% A strong pillar of direct payments is vital for the world and to meet food demands . #% Measures such as this will assist the competitiveness of regions , attract mobile investment and hopefully offset the tendencies for companies to set up in locations that are already congested . #% In line with the conclusions of the Tampere Summit , EU leaders are committed to introducing a European arrest warrant , designed to supplant the current system of extradition in Europe . #% It makes a laughing-stock of the debates in this Parliament . #% A lot has already been said about ` to vaccinate or not to vaccinate ' , be it prophylactic vaccination , ring vaccination , emergency vaccination or contingency vaccination . #% Firstly , the plan is : dump the common agricultural policy . #% We voted `` no '' because of those kinds of problems . #% We must all ensure that under no circumstances is there any sort of backlash whatsoever against the Muslim communities within our Union . #% My problems began this morning at a very early point when my flight from Belfast to London was cancelled . #% 
In Ireland , social spending cuts provide money to fuel economic growth . #% Since 1954 , when our TB scheme was introduced , we have spent in Ireland - a small country - EUR 2.54 billion on TB testing and subsequently brucellosis testing . #% We are approaching - if we are not already there - the watershed of the history of the Union . #% The list is endless - take your pick . #% It is disturbing to note the major rush towards the militarisation of the European Union . #% Cohesion policies are vital to delivering a citizen 's Europe and giving tangible support to regions and communities , to open up access to the opportunities of the single market for jobs and training . #% Is it a question for Member States or is it an initiative that must be taken by the European Union ? #% I , too , have had reason to be grateful for biotechnological advances as I am an insulin-dependent diabetic and I use insulin . #% When you consider the size of the European Union , the number of farmers involved , the area and the problems , we are spending 0.4 % of GDP on the common agricultural policy . #% Campaigns such as the one million roofs , the one hundred solar communities and the golden sun awards are visionary ways of making renewables real to people on the ground and I know that they will be very interesting if we can actually pursue them in a practical way . #% Today I voted against the amended proposal and legislative resolution on REACH because , as the votes progressed , amendments to ease the burden on SMEs were generally lost . #% I condemn without reservation violence from whatever quarter . #% Equally , European Union leaders are right to call on Israel to withdraw its military forces , stop extra-judicial executions , lift closures and restrictions on the Palestinian people , free settlements and end operations directed against Palestinian infrastructure . #% The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy of Parliament is right to endorse the European Commission 's proposal for an international initiative for the Internet and electronic commerce . #% This is a fundamental right given to each citizen of the European Union . #% We have seen that in recent days . #% This year - 2003 - is the year of the disabled . #% And if Irish farmers were to follow the letter of the directive and spread slurry when allowed , they would cause pollution rather than prevent it . #% I am not saying that Mr Dupuis , the Greens and the Socialists are not right to open up the argument . #% The PEACE programme is of much more than purely financial importance to Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland . #% I think this is the start of that process . #% I recall that in 1992 , in a report that I wrote , Parliament rejected the switch-over system . #% Finally , Commissioner , in 1999 I asked you a question in response to which you told me that cars in Britain would be cheaper if Britain joined the euro . #% It was therefore decided to extend the protocol by one year and a new protocol was initialled by both parties on 16 June 2000 . #% This should come about as soon as possible and I urge the Commission to really look at this at an early date . #% We have heard from various Members about the disparities in fines and controls in Member States , which I do not have enough time to address now . #% Mr President , my primary observation has to be that the proposed structural and cohesion funding package for 2007-2013 fails to provide adequately for those regions within the EU-15 which , though themselves deficient in infrastructure investment , failed because of the national criteria to qualify for cohesion funds . #% We should encourage further development of this area , in particular for those who are disadvantaged . #% In the long run this is the right approach to take for the sake of public health , consumer protection and the environment . #% You can not have prosperity without peace and stability . #% We need rigorous and exhaustive impact studies before any such scheme takes place . #% Mr President , I would like to put on record my thanks to the rapporteur for a brilliant report and also to the draftsperson from the Committee on Women 's Rights for her input . #% I urge the Iraqi regime to change course and allow UN inspectors to be readmitted to Iraq now . #% Clever people of Europe , the money is on its way ! #% They also have concerns , which I would share , about the very severe penalties which Member States might impose on them for breaches of the regulations that are not deliberate . #% With regard to the allocation for biotechnology , this has been vastly increased . #% The SAVE I programme was very small beer , a very small amount of money . #% However , we have to realise that dialogue must involve both sides of the Atlantic . #% Mr President , it is hard to do justice to the extreme injustice of this decision in one minute but I will try to portray to Members the conversations Mrs Kinnock and I had in Washington last week . #% It is perhaps a pity that this draft of the Irish presidency does not pose this question for it needs to be faced and , I would say , sooner rather than later . #% The purpose of the SBA has been to reduce the administrative burden of doing business and improve access to finance for SMEs . #% If the European project does not have the support of the people of Europe it will not succeed , and the Commission is failing to recognise this . #% But is simply not true to state that the board of a company faced with a hostile takeover can not take action or is obliged to remain neutral or passive . #% I wish to put on record , as someone who has a long-standing interest in that policy question , that I ask whether I am entitled to receive a copy of the written and oral submissions which were made on behalf of the House on an issue which is of grave concern to many Members . #% Tibet , however , is an international treasure and international treasures are not the preserve of any one people . #% If we fail these defenceless people , then our foreign policy aspirations are a failure . #% When we talk about the polluter-pays principle , the multinationals must be held accountable for the fact that conventional farmers , and in particular organic farmers , are not going to be allowed to do what they have done in the past . #% That is , of course , not necessarily true . #% Opportunistic Eurosceptic stances by some of its leading members played into the hands of those who opposed the Treaty of Nice , thereby contributing to its rejection . #% It is only one of many directives covered by this package of laws that we are putting through today and , as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I therefore want to ask you to address some of the key future issues to enhance consumer confidence and to ensure consumer safety and awareness . #% In Europe , children are routinely given the BCG vaccination , which has greater than 80 % effectiveness . #% This very week in that most notable of years 1690 , William , Prince of Orange , landed at Carrickfergus in my constituency and brought us in the United Kingdom the Glorious Revolution and the Williamite settlement , which to this day is the basis of freedom ... #% Presented with this information , I hope that ECOFIN and the Commission will be sufficiently persuaded , at the very least , to extend duty-free beyond the 30 June next year . #% Because , ultimately , if we really want to respond to what is occurring in the European Union of today , we must first recognise that , whatever crisis we may perceive , the people out there do not see it as a crisis . #% So I believe the best way is to make it easier for young farmers to inherit the family farm at an earlier stage , be it through an early retirement scheme or through a bond scheme . #% Mr President , the proposals for the reform of the CAP made by Mr Fischler are being driven by the World Trade Organisation , and farmers need to realise that should be their real target . #% Are you convinced that should Romania accede next year , it will continue on that path towards reform ? #% Amendment No 25 by Mr Novo Belenguer and others correctly represents this position and I will be glad to support it . #% The nominee for president intends , health permitting , to serve at least until the switch-over from national notes and coins to euros has been achieved . #% While I agree with much of this report , I am wary of proposals for a corporate consolidated tax base and voted against accordingly . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I support the initiative of Mrs Green . #% We must try to engage with people , so that we can open their minds and our own to what underlies their hopelessness . #% It is not possible to separate the administrative element of taxation powers , including mutual assistance provisions , from the tax raising prerogative and this should remain subject to unanimous voting . #% The levels of violence and the levels of provocation have risen to new heights , and this is the primary reason why the parties are now no longer engaged in dialogue . #% There is also a need for a Europe-wide epidemiological study which should be financed by the European Union , and that should be done as a matter of urgency . #% The standard of health in the Gaza Strip is very low . #% 
Can we move on to the explanation of votes please ? #% Ecofin 's report to Florence on what I would characterize as the non-implementation of the 1995 guidelines , following hard on the heels of the non-implementation of the 1994 guidelines , is a ritualistic , bland and passive document in the face of this pathetic factual record . #% As regards the Irish presidency , the programme of the Irish presidency states that , on security and disarmament , it will pursue the continuing and effective development of EU/WEU cooperation on the basis of the Treaty on European Union in cooperation with the Belgian WEU presidency . #% It is eminently sensible to promote renewable energy because it enables us to fulfil our environmental objectives , creates jobs and ensures security of supply . #% Indeed , I believe the allocation of rural funding should bear some proportionality to the budgetary contributions of Member States . #% Mr President , this is like a TV quiz show - I am getting different advice from each side . #% It failed . #% We have in the European Union Mr Mobutu , so-called President Mobutu , who is being given refuge in his palace in the south of France . #% It could lead to hysteria if people do not understand exactly what it means . #% Indeed , if you want to judge him on his record , then look at his record as Minister of Finance in Ireland concerning the social model , where health care was increased , pensions were increased and the highest minimum wage was introduced under his watch . #% How can you deliver a common fisheries policy if some governments avail of options and some do not ? #% Companies and consumers are finding it difficult to gauge whether their prospects are good or bad . #% Their case has been before this Parliament 's Committee on Petitions for a year and a half . #% The media , of course , have had a field day , fed by people who should know better , like Ms Lynne . #% Members ought perhaps to be aware that this is not a very nice way of behaving towards the staff of Parliament . #% Their chief executive recently earned a personal bonus of # IRL 17 million . #% Therefore he has failed to honour and respect this House by giving a direct answer to a direct question . #% These are mainly covered by the Council 's common position which we very much welcome , because we feel it is important that there be some flexibility for the processing of traditional products and also in relation to artisanal production . #% Whatever emerges , there is a duty on the EU to continue to press for reform in Romania 's state residential institutions . #% That is why we back a debate on alternative ways to fund the EU , cutting the amount coming from VAT and the national budget through options such as coordinated measures addressing the under-taxed financial sector . #% Most employees with acute or chronic depression , for example , hide it from their employers for fear of the adverse impact on their careers . #% We will have a majority by the end of next week for the Treaty of Nice . #% On 12 September 2005 , Parliament 's Subcommittee on Human Rights held a hearing on Cambodia , Laos and Vietnam , as has been pointed out by previous speakers . #% I also welcome the recent decision of the Committee on the Environment to restate that this draft directive should be strengthened into a framework directive out of which further , more detailed and specific legislation can follow , in other words , daughter directives . #% My second point is that Mr Oostlander is perfectly within his rights to say that , under Rule 115 , proceeding with the debate or the vote can be questioned as the documentation was not available 24 hours in advance . #% That is why , in the spirit of better legislation called for by Commissioner Prodi recently , my group will give the Commission conditional support for the regulation if it agrees to carry out an evaluation study to examine exactly how sales below cost can benefit both small businesses and consumers . #% It is certainly something which needs to be attended to , in my view . #% Earlier this week the US-ASEAN Business Council , which represents the cream of American and South-East Asian business people , made a strong denunciation of economic sanctions against Burma . #% Young boys are terrorised into virtual slavery as guards and soldiers . #% There is no point in setting a deadline that can not be achieved and triggering the inevitable infringement procedures . #% What would happen then if someone fleeing from persecution were to seek asylum or help from the EU embassy if it did not suit the EU 's interests to support him or her ? #% In the light of this , we must make certain that the restrictions domestically imposed do not impact disproportionately to the detriment of other key industries and public life generally . #% I ask you , Mr President , to make direct contact with the United States Congress to express the concerns of this Parliament and also to urge the President-in-Office of the Council to make contact with the authorities in the United States to express our concerns . #% Mr President , my oral amendment is to avoid ambiguity in recital C. I propose to insert the word ` unfortunately ' between the word ` whereas ' and ` Somalia ' and to replace the words ` with a view to restoring order ' with the words ` with a view to taking charge ' . #% For the ill-informed it was an eye-opener as to current human rights abuses , restrictions of freedoms and political and religious repression , with different accounts coming from each country . #% Because we want to make injury surveillance more comprehensive we include mention of risk-taking behaviour , drugs and alcohol , gender considerations , social and environmental condition . #% Could the EU not use its influence to encourage Equatorial Guinea to cease allowing vessels to use its flag to fish illegally . #% In the Liberal Group we have been consistently in favour of many of the elements in the Stauner report such as access to documents - it is a duty of the current Commission to provide access to documents . #% But what do we see happening ? #% I saw a report at one time which said that we could increase the catch from European waters by 50 % if we would apply the conservation measures necessary . #% So the problems are first-hand and they are all-pervasive . #% While I strongly support China 's admission to the WTO , we should give China a dose of its own medicine . #% Mr President , Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz , Mrs Ewing and Mr Pimenta have said it all today . #% They ignore the damage and destruction caused to the beef industry in neighbouring Member States . #% These include the United Kingdom , where nothing more than lip service has been paid to the development of organic farming . #% I would like to see the development of small local initiatives which would strengthen rural development by the provision of , say , 20 to 30 jobs per project . #% But by lowering the intensity without changing the objective , Milosevic knows that a village a day is keeping the West away . #% However , I have to say that I am disappointed that the UK is not prepared to implement the territorial employment pacts and I ask Commissioner Flynn what he is prepared to do in order to gain its support . #% We all know that we must put in place a new European Union treaty , if the European Union is to modernise and become more effective in a Community of 25 Member States . #% There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority . #% Perhaps you could enlighten us with the legal expertise at your disposal . #% Can I comment on what Mr Lyon just said ? #% The percentage of women elected to the Member States ' national parliaments varies between 45 % and 9 % . #% Critical to it also is a programme of sensitising people in trade unions and in employers ' organisations to the fact that there is another half of the human race who are entitled to equality as of right and not just as a privilege . #% However , the Environment Committee did give the ferrets a knock and that is where it stands subject to perhaps investigating what my colleague Mr Whitehead has said . #% In accordance with the precautionary principle and as a measure to promote consumer confidence , a policy of zero tolerance of processed animal proteins and meat and animal bonemeal in animal feed was put in place . #% Mr President , may I take it from what the Commissioner said that he is undertaking to give Parliament an annual report and will take into account the other two points in my conclusions ? #% I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply . #% I commend Mr Fox on his work to at least bring some modicum of common sense in 2012 and 2013 . #% I am very concerned that the Irish Government is complacent in its attitude towards its Kyoto Protocol commitments , which they entered into in December 1997 . #% As you mentioned yesterday , Commissioner , it is always easier to find reasons not to do something . #% However , I am alarmed by the unholy haste in pushing through such a sweeping , power-shifting and undemocratic initiative as the proposed European Constitution . #% In addition , when you listen to some of the debate , it is like going back to the future , because the same issues and points that were raised in opposition to the first treaties in the 1950s , and to the second and subsequent treaties in the 1970s and 1980s , are being rehashed . #% I believe that is what we are all trying to do . #% We had to try to achieve a level playing field between European airlines and the airlines of the United States , which then received even greater support than our airlines . #% I am disappointed that my amendment to extend the thirty-mile exclusive zone has not been accepted . #% 
I ask Member States to look seriously at the framework in which we consider it . #% Mr President , the advent of competition in the air transport sector has certainly resulted in the lowering of prices of air travel for the 370 million consumers of the European Union . #% At a recent meeting with Coillte I was told that the government is gong to challenge this decision . #% It is such a fundamental and important issue that I hope we do not abandon the attempt because of this difficulty . #% I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue . #% It does seem a little bit strange since , at the core of the EU , we have the free movement of goods ; therefore we would end up , if we use CCCTB , by penalising exporting countries . #% in writing . - While tuberculosis is viewed by many in the past tense and seen as a 19th century affliction , it continues to have a serious impact , both directly and indirectly , on the lives of hundreds of thousands of farmers across the EU each year . #% They also coincide with the Irish presidency plans as outlined in the Culture Committee in January . #% Europe should be sending a message beyond its borders that inhuman or degrading treatment of people with disabilities is utterly unacceptable . #% However , the chaos and the oppression of the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe has led to no satisfactory response from Zimbabwe 's neighbours , who seem deaf to the cries of anguish from the oppressed people of that country . #% Yet the value of these items is small and court redress would be costly and nonsensical . #% Some believe that the impact assessments should be handed over to an external body . #% Fundamental research is essential , but equally we must facilitate the application of research and development in European businesses and foster innovation . #% That is what makes them choose other careers . #% Madam President , I am rather sorry that Mr Chichester chose to end his contribution with a plea for building more nuclear power stations . #% However , the amendment was defeated as it would have interfered with the catching of sharks by EU industry . #% We have learned an expensive lesson but one that marked an important turning-point in EU food production and one from which we can benefit in the long term . #% The Community has agreed to several international instruments which seek to control fishing capacity and/or fishing effort . #% Taking all these things together , why do we in this Chamber seem to speak about a crisis of confidence in Europe , when the level of crisis , fear and loathing which some people would have you believe exists is simply not there among the general public ? #% It is unacceptable that such a punishment is carried out in a country that considers itself advanced . #% As regards the Antarctic , the European Union has no real fishing interests , at least on paper . #% The current agreement provides little in the way of serious targeted measures and contains no provisions to ensure their transparent implementation or any assessment of the result . #% I voted `` against '' . #% It took another twelve years before a comprehensive peace process got under way at the Madrid Conference in October 1999 , which enshrined the principle of exchanging land for peace . #% Biodiversity is at risk , but there is also a need to ensure that urban , transport and infrastructure planning does take climate change into account . #% The redundancies at Dell have seriously affected the local Limerick economy and surrounding areas . #% This Parliament must actively oppose the ` race to the bottom ' approach to employment and working conditions which is now rife within the European Union . #% Unlike those opposite we listened to the answers to questions about the future roles . #% The political establishment in that country has dismally failed its people , particularly the youth . #% I should like to remind the Commission that while we are very willing to have discussions with you on the perfomance reserve , we do not have the right of initiative . #% Mr President , I would like to emphasise one recommendation of this report : the need for clarity in GMOs . #% That is a proposal which I tabled in December 2000 after Nice . #% in writing . - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the work of the rapporteur Edward Scicluna . #% Secondly , can we utilise already existing airline hubs to ensure that peripheral areas can be serviced into those areas as well ? #% Successful ratification is possible , but only if a huge effort is put into the ` yes ' campaign . #% I have had at least six families come to me about this . #% Mr President , this obviously is not Ryanair 's evening . #% Can the Commission encourage the removal of those older animals ? #% The CAP reform has changed the policy framework to ensure a more market-oriented and sustainable agriculture and food industry . #% As other speakers have said , it does show Parliament at its most hard-working and efficient . #% It is quite clear that there is a lack of political will there , and something has to be done about it . #% We should stand with workers in China . #% I should like to compliment her on her interest in pursuing the whole matter . #% The truth is that serious concern exists on a number of levels . #% In the longer term , in the light of experience and information as a result of implementing the framework Water Directive , we may then be in a much better position to translate threshold values at national level into EU-wide groundwater quality standards . #% In fact , within this institution we have voted that abortion should never be used as a means of family planning and that it never should be funded for that purpose . #% Mr Oostlander 's report is a small but very important step in that direction . #% We have to continue to have our substantial development needs looked after post-1999 . #% Given the current crisis in the beef industry , it would be better to avoid further reforms at least until we have mastered the present crisis . #% The Irish Government has never yet appointed a woman to the Court of Auditors . #% The EU must insist on an independent inquiry and we must take action that will ensure that , if we are refused that , it will have implications for the relationship between Uzbekistan and the European Union . #% Madam President , I would like to congratulate my respected colleague General Morillon on his report . #% I can bring hundreds of examples of discrimination , of ignorance , thousands of examples of prejudice . #% But legislation is just one part of the equation ; enforcing that legislation is another . #% Therefore , I support the proposal contained in paragraph 10 of the report which calls for any state to be excluded which clearly fails to respect human rights , democracy and the rule of law from ASEM activities . #% They really are criminals who through negligence or through deliberate action are destroying the environment , affecting human health , affecting our flora and fauna and causing in many other ways long-term damage , all in the interest of profit . #% Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe , an enterprising Europe , a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me , in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues , give in one adjective , one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance : an enabling Europe . #% The infrastructure , organisation and technology that are needed for a cleaner environment are all achievable because of the wealth and surpluses of the local economies . #% There has been peaceful progress on the Lebanese-Israeli border since the Lebanese Government gained authority within the region , and we all must certainly welcome the fact that southern Lebanon is now at peace . #% This should be the major pillar on which this new Commission is judged . #% I 'd also like to take this opportunity to say that I hope our caution also shows our solidarity and fraternity with our Greek and Portuguese colleagues who are having a notably difficult time at the moment . #% Just as we were delighted to remove Berlin walls in Europe , we do not want to see similar walls erected in Jerusalem . #% The ELDR group pledges itself to that task . #% The Union has given considerable political and practical support to this process over the years and I very much hope that the British presidency will ensure that the important developments of recent weeks are given due consideration in Cardiff . #% In the life of the current Parliament we have agreed a whole new regulatory environment for the sector , and that is something of which this House , and of course Commissioner Byrne , can be justly proud . #% In today 's world we have too much indifference towards the plight of those who are most in need of our support - not our sympathy , not our charity , not our patronising - to allow them to live full and independent lives and to be treated as equals in the 21st Century . #% 
As one of the 200 parliamentarians from every corner of Europe who prepared this text in open forum , may I say that what we have is a qualitatively different treaty proposal from any treaty that has ever been put before the people of Europe . #% On the positive side , compared with the old extradition process , the time delay has reduced dramatically . #% We know that inequalities persist and it is the objective of cohesion to continue to try to overcome these . #% Obviously the Greens would have liked to have seen this directive strengthened , but we know that the tactics of the tobacco lobbying industry were to try to get an amendment put in so that when it went back to the Council the majority there would change it , because of undue pressure by Germany , in particular . #% We , who are fortunate enough to be born into a part of the world where there are no food shortages , drought or famine , have a moral responsibility to work towards a more just world . #% . Mr President , once again the eyes of the world are on the Middle East . #% What is going on here is neoliberalism , which is very similar to neocolonialism , and it is being done with the help of the Brazilian Government . #% However , some countries need to cut back on their budgets and others -- like my own , Ireland -- need to spend more on infrastructure , because they have a deficit , but that is not allowed under the rules . #% The peace process in Ireland has benefited hugely from the EU budget . #% I do not see how anyone in this House could actually support the use of EU funds - EU taxpayers ' money , that is - to allow shipowners to escape controls and then fish in competition with law-abiding shipowners . #% I suggest that will be inoperable and unenforceable . #% It is absolutely impossible ! #% I am concerned that it could be used by some of the scientists and others as an opportunity to curb TACs and quotas when there is disagreement between fishermen and the scientists . #% The IGC is putting forward proposals to eliminate controls at the Union 's internal borders . #% Mr President , the principle of eco-labelling is sound . #% The main concern that legislators and health teams face today with regard to breast cancer is that every woman , irrespective of her place of residence , social status , occupation and education , should have access to high-quality screening for treatment and aftercare in the event of cancer . #% I was the rapporteur on the Development and Cooperation Instrument . #% Under international law , it is the responsibility of the state whose flag vessels fly to ensure that they abide by the relevant rules and regulations ; for example , conservation measures , safety and labour standards , etc. . #% However , there is still a lot of uncertainty concerning the security measures in airports . #% There are also considerable concerns regarding the intrusive nature of these images , and we must ensure that the privacy of European citizens is protected before we agree to the widespread distribution of these time-consuming and expensive machines . #% It is in the area of the intergovernmental conference that the Irish presidency has passed on its greatest legacy . #% However , as regards the issues in this report , as we have said , by and large we agree with much of the proposal . #% On a separate but related matter , it is certainly the case that the working group on freedom , security and justice at the European Convention has brought forward some interesting proposals in this area . #% In Ireland over the last number of years there has been a tremendous increase in the number of companies making use of the ADAPT programme , and this has allowed them not only to give new opportunities to existing workers but also to expand into other areas of technology and to bring in new people who were unemployed or long-term unemployed . #% It is worth bearing in mind that a 1 % increase can lead to ecosystem damage . #% Despite our misgivings about one aspect or the other of this report , we should be brave enough to give the leadership that the people of Europe expect from this Parliament , the elected representatives of the people of Europe . #% Mr President , congratulations to Mrs Plooij , who is a good speaker , but more importantly , a very good listener . #% There is already a commercial trade in this , which is very reprehensible . #% I want to sound a note of caution . #% Commissioner Flynn is to be congratulated for coming forward with a draft directive on worker consultation in firms with more than 50 employees . #% The EU has competence over matters such as telecommunications , transport and energy , but it does not have competence under the EU Treaties to legislate in a broad capacity on matters governing the operation of social services , health and education within the different Member States . #% In the second reading in Parliament , there was no definitive resolution on the crucial vexed issue of the dual legal base of the regulation , which was retained . #% Secondly , I am not entirely clear from listening to the Commission whether the incipient ban on trade into the United Kingdom has the goodwill of the Commissioner or not . #% On reform , human rights , religious freedom , Cyprus , Armenia we have obtained nothing , but in return we have wasted , and will continue to waste , millions on pre-accession aid . #% I am delighted that Mr Prodi is prepared to be proactive . #% The central banks of these countries will then converge under the auspices of the European Central Bank in 1999 . #% As you know , it is one of the main focuses of the Irish presidency . #% It was sensible to remove the prescriptive obligation for mandatory audit committees and replace it with a proposal to assign those functions to a body that meets audit standards and objectives and can implement the requirements in a transparent way . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs has voted through an amendment tabled by Lord Inglewood which would recognise surveyors as being qualified to design buildings . #% in writing . - I welcome the Commission 's Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU . #% That is why we argue in favour of a specific instrument for the needs of the developing countries , namely poverty alleviation with true economic cooperation and sustainable development , and not just a default instrument for all countries not covered by any other instrument . #% The House set up a group which reports to the House and we have a general political debate . #% Mr President , I want to reiterate the concern that colleagues , particularly Irish colleagues , have mentioned about this MOX shipment back from Japan . #% It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we can strengthen the fight against fraud and protect the interests of all taxpayers in Europe . #% I do not wish to repeat what has been said by colleagues who have already spoken but it has been a very great two-and-a-half years . #% Golf courses do not qualify #% However , we will still ensure that workers exposed to optical radiation will be fully protected and that their health and safety will be looked after . #% We had gone from a worthy ambition of seven last August to up to three , plus of course Penta BDE , the Norwegian proposal , which might be a fourth one . #% The European Parliament 's Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy has voted on the liberalisation directives for gas and electricity and we have reached the conclusion that if liberalisation takes place without paying attention to the environmental , consumer and social consequences , you are embarking on a dangerous journey . #% In the present programme Ireland is assessed as a single unit for funding . #% It is up to the representatives of those countries themselves to be realistic and not hypocritical , not to play party politics and hide behind doublespeak . #% Mr President , the tragic events in America have sent severe economic shock waves through the world . #% I suppose in many ways these can be divided up into four separate yet linked areas . #% However , the scourge of AIDS is robbing many developing countries of their finest young people . #% This cheating of the regions has gone on for years . #% If a Portuguese or Dutch citizen were to smoke on board an Irish ship in international waters , that would break Irish law . #% We must allow research to continue in order to relieve the suffering of the millions with serious diseases and spinal injuries , Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's , motor neurone disease , diabetes , cancer , heart disease : the list is endless . #% Firstly , we need to agree upon a set minimum safety net for all sectors which are vulnerable to price fluctuations . #% I am sure Commissioner Fischler is also pleased about that . #% We also must not compromise that principle of excellence . #% The President-in-Office said the Council can not share Parliament 's view on the evolution of monetary policy . #% Fléchard took the Irish government to court and won an injunction preventing the Irish government from taking the EUR 17 million . #% He had chosen as the symbol of his party the donkey . #% Unfortunately , the press ignores the real work of this Parliament , the serious work that it undertakes , be it on foreign policy , be it on the promotion of human rights and democracy and , indeed , on other issues , and they will concentrate on these sorts of issues . #% We can not bury our heads in the sand and deny the fact that this is already happening . #% We bear equal responsibility for maintaining and strengthening our efforts to prevent biodiversity loss and environmental degradation . #% 
Guantánamo is in this category . #% Mr President , I would like to make explanations of vote on two reports combined : on the Cappato and Cederschiöld reports . #% I would ask you , Mr President , on behalf of the third largest group in this Parliament to protest at the treatment meted out to Members of the European Parliament by the Angolan Government . #% I understand this need well . #% Decoupling , taken together with the WTO proposals , will cause a reduction in EU production of beef and sheepmeat . #% Let me recall one of the results of these inquiries : in the past five years the average delay in the disbursement of committed funds has increased from three years to four-and-a-half years . #% I should like first of all to thank Mr Prodi for elaborating today at much greater length on a number of the priorities which he wishes to emphasise for the next Commission . #% In relation to mass-medication , it is completely unacceptable in terms of freedom of choice that 9 million UK citizens and 2.7 million Irish citizens are being forcibly mass-medicated . #% As Mrs Dybkjær has just said , what they have done is to tell the other EU governments to carry on as usual ; they will then go back to the Irish people and get them to vote again until they get it right . #% There , they have periodical dry-run operations and the strategy nationwide is tested , weaknesses are discovered and the fine-tuning of the whole programme is updated . #% I have no fault to find with the way the Commission interacted with the agriculture industry over the years . #% I am proud to be associated with the United Socialist Party in Sri Lanka , which is a sister party of the Socialist Party in Ireland , and which has heroically stood up against the chauvinism of the government for the rights of the Tamil and Sinhala people and the rights of the Tamil people to self-determination . #% Therefore , we can not support any individual amendment at this stage . #% Vessels that fish under flags of convenience ignore all the rules , they exploit the best fishing grounds and they wreak havoc . #% However , only the naive would fail to recognise it as part of a jigsaw for an integrated European criminal justice system , leading ultimately to the subservience of our national systems , not least in the vital area of how we should be free to tackle terrorism . #% At least people come here to the Parliament and they are heard and listened to . #% Clearly , this means radical change in the production and consumption of energy . #% They are n't . #% When Commissioner Gradin raised this issue and made it one of the priorities for her term of office , there was probably quite a lot of amusement and scepticism about the extent of the problem . #% Everyone who has studied this dossier in great detail and who has discussed it free from polemics , but not free from their political preferences , has a view on these issues ; no one made any personal accusation or imputation against you . #% I hope that during this autumn , under the Belgian Presidency , we will see both of those draft directives adopted . #% I would ask you to look particularly at the problem of neonates and infants , who are being fed milk formula from reconstituted , fluoridated tap water . #% Thank you for your response and also for giving us a few more moments . #% My own country has a particular problem with the Schengen Agreement , not with the principle of it , but because of a long traditional arrangement with our nearest neighbour and because of a border situation with Northern Ireland . #% In relation to the accession reports on the individual states , I have grave concern about the emphasis on the common foreign and security aspect , the fact that countries are being coerced into joining Nato . #% It is too small for that , even in the area of Structural Funds , for even the most generous beneficiaries receive a very small percentage of GNP . #% We have had double-digit inflation in housing for some time and it looks like we will continue to have that . #% At short notice , I have agreed to try and say a few words on his behalf in relation to this most important topic . #% We have a certain margin of manoeuvre within which to do it . #% If we are genuine about wanting to encourage firms to improve environmental policy and environmental performance , then it is necessary that the best available technology should be encouraged . #% The importance of the family in promoting or hampering social integration among youth is clearly recognised within society today , as well as through various studies . #% I need your guidance , as I know it is late procedurally , Mr President , but we need to be sure that what we do and vote on today makes sense and is factually correct . #% The tuna would be caught in the way that is acceptable to us and the French and Irish and British would not have to sustain any losses . #% But one must ask the question if that was the intention , are they the ones currently benefiting ? #% In fact , if my amendments - which were modest - had been carried , the Cairo Conference and all the related issues would have been respected . #% We have a problem in Europe because we simply have no idea of the numbers of children affected . #% The simple aim of the proposal is to ensure that wherever consumers shop in the European Union , they will enjoy minium levels of guarantees and will be able to seek redress in their home countries . #% This trial has been carefully watched internationally and if there is a negative verdict it will undoubtedly be a miscarriage of justice . #% For example , some people have put forward the proposition that ecstasy use should be deemed quite normal in society . #% On the Irish interest rate , those of us who have lent another country money deserve an interest rate which reflects the risk , but we also want our money back . #% But if it is merely a technical slip-up , it would be a political mistake to call a Conference of Presidents for the purpose of dealing in a political organ of the House with something for which there is a perfectly reasonable technical explanation . #% Our message to them today , in this fight for democracy and against terrorism , is that our only choice is to stand united ; for united we stand but divided we shall fall . #% There is total hypocrisy as regards this Parliament and what we discuss . #% Such a development would also make a nonsense of these countries ' achievements in providing basic health and education support , which have contributed so much to furthering the well-being of their peoples . #% Farming needs to be made an attractive career prospect and if we are to bring young qualified people into the profession , a failure to do so will lead to further depopulation of rural areas to the point where certain rural communities will no longer be sustainable . #% Could I ask the Commissioner if he would circulate the research that has been done to show that cars running with daytime lights significantly reduces road accidents . #% It is time for action . #% Much of the funding will be directed towards major cross-border projects , but I do not believe that this can be effective without all countries concerned signing binding bilateral agreements . #% This is an important distinction which demonstrates that we are not supporting a shirking of responsibilities . #% Let us think about the developing world and the energy needs there . #% Sympathetic utterances are not enough . #% Let us not pit those people against children in our own Member States going to school on bread and jam , which I deplore also . #% It has already made it clear that it intends to promote wider cooperation between law enforcement agencies throughout the Union . #% We all know that the lesson we have learned from that particular crisis in European farming is that we must have a food chain that guarantees the highest possible standards of traceability and safety . #% When we questioned Commissioners Liikanen and Lamy , we did so objectively , asking questions about their role . #% In the old days people went out and took risks with their lives and bad equipment ; today they have the capacity to know where the fish are , to get them , and to exploit them and they should have to pay a fee for that . #% The European Structural Funds have played a considerable role in helping less-developed and peripheral nations to prepare the completion of the Single Market , and in the introduction of the European single currency . #% You said that those comments were not correct . #% There is a need for phosphate-free detergents . #% I totally agree with all the very many well-deserved , fine compliments which have been paid to you by the leaders of the other Groups here today . #% As a final point , all those who fear that the EU is facing an identity crisis at the moment should take heart from this report . #% There is a strong , growing realisation that we must re-invigorate the process to put in place a new European Union treaty , and delay and prevarication , recrimination and confrontation do nothing whatsoever to move this political process forward . #% The Commission has now adopted this idea , which I welcome , by proposing the creation of regional advisory councils which will include fishermen and their organisations for the very first time . #% Subject : Iceland 's application to join the European Union #% The Council of Ministers has been less helpful , if not obdurate , in its approach . #% The Irish Government will therefore be proposing a declaration in Seville on traditional Irish military neutrality , which I hope will be approved by other Member States . #% 
We must give judges and courts in the enlarged EU the option of a range of enforcement tools . #% As Commissioner Patten said , it is up to the Council to raise this matter with the United States , and the EU Council has failed abysmally to do so on any occasion . #% The proposals of the Commission are a significant step along the path towards a more responsible approach to fishing activities . #% Whilst we should take encouragement from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body 's rejection of recent attacks by the United States and Australia , we can not afford any sense of complacency . #% Most fundamentally , there is no coordination and no unit of the Commission , no Directorate-General which takes a lead in developing a coherent , overall policy on children . #% Only seven per cent of the EU 's farmers are under 35 years of age - this is a stark reminder that we need to ensure that the conditions exist to keep young people farming . #% One needs only to look at Denmark . #% It is important that they are not only entitled but also encouraged to do so . #% First there was the Iran/Iraq war ; a war sponsored by the West in the main . #% The Parliament has already shown more ambition than the Member States in relation to a reduction in carbon emissions , and today 's resolution is to be welcomed with calls for real financing , calls for strong targets in the high end from 25-40 % in line with the science , and the insistence on a legally binding agreement . #% It is important that scientific testing look at the dioxin/PCB level of compound feed as an end product , rather than the dioxin level of just one ingredient such as fish oil . #% He mentioned the need for the statute . #% Health and safety in the workplace can only be maintained where adequate monitoring is conducted at workplace level . #% However , there have been problems with the implementation of this in certain Member States and thus the Commission 's current approach is welcome . #% Commission involvement in Member States ' tax arrangements must come with a serious health warning . #% To give you one example , in Ireland telephone line rental for people who are on the old age pension is free . #% I would like to support my colleague , Mr Cashman , and in particular point out that this Parliament has been a very active supporter of the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland . #% In the light of these issues we should be cognisant of the difficulties which will be created . #% The present system has brought stability to the sector and enabled the Community to be a modest but regular exporter to world markets . #% Clear evidence has emerged that the police , the British army and intelligence services all colluded in his murder . #% So there is a serious mistake there . #% It parades a fictitious commitment to neutrality while allowing US army planes to use Shannon airport despite the clear condemnation by the Irish people of the action in which these planes are engaged . #% Mr President , I would like to compliment the rapporteurs on all the hard work they have invested in this report . #% I want the people of this House to know that every major newspaper supported a ` yes ' for eastern Europe . #% Why did your government vote to allow EU funding for embryo-destructive research , when our people have always cherished the most vulnerable citizens ? #% On 30 December last year , I received a petition on behalf of concerned citizens signed by over a quarter of a million people calling for us to bring in that ban . #% But it happened , and it is something that in my opinion the European Union does not devote enough attention to . #% That strengthened enormously the will for peace among the people . #% Our Group also naturally considers it important that the renewed request should be dealt with both expeditiously and in full accordance with the proper procedures laid down in the Treaty . #% In fact they have negative effects on fish stocks , the marketing of non-human-consumption species , technical measures and so on . #% Furthermore , what will be done about the bottom trawlers that make up the vast majority of the current European fleet and are at risk of being wiped out by the current emergency package which has been proposed ? #% We need to speed up the development of alternative testing . #% Mr President , like Mrs Breyer I voted against this report . #% Will it deliver a better form of justice ? #% Member States and regional advisory councils must be able to propose alterations both to the geographical scope of the plan and the exact arrangements designed to reduce fishing efforts . #% On that final point , I would like to say that the Centre for Independent Living , which is based in Ireland , is bringing a delegation from all over Europe for the second part-session here in September . #% I want to draw attention particularly to the BSE crisis , which has incurred an increase in expenditure of 50 % , up to ECU 7 billion in that sector . #% Mr President , the most striking statistic I have heard tonight is the one from the Commissioner when she indicated that it would take 2 500 years for us to reach a position of equality for women if we continue at the same pace . #% I strongly support the family unit being based on the natural order of complementary sex couples and I value the benefit to children which results . #% - I wish to place on record my satisfaction that current directives governing architects ' qualifications are adequate to enable those who are not currently registered as architects in Ireland to become registered as such . #% Mr President , this week the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party raised consciousness inside and outside this House of the fact that the rules of engagement for the democratic control of the European Commission by this Parliament are self-evidently inadequate . #% But the Council rejected much of that advice . #% ( Mr President , thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on the Irish presidency . #% As far as the Euratom section of the Sixth Framework Programme is concerned , I have very grave doubts as to whether the ITER project will be implemented and my personal view - this is not the view of the rapporteur - is that extra funding is not therefore needed . #% The scrapping of the Supreme Court did immeasurable damage to the separation of power systems within Pakistan . #% I would just like to take us back a little bit . #% In many Member States , there is no requirement to even look at demand site management . #% The EU , which brought former enemies together for peaceful cooperation , is now being militarised . #% I hope that all Members of the European Parliament will complain about this outrageous breach of human rights . #% - There is a framework decision on this issue still with the Council of Ministers . #% Mr President , first of all , cohesion funding has been very important in underpinning the success of the 2004 enlargement and , like others , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work in that area . #% Today I want to deal with the effect they are having on the regional areas of Europe , rather than the major cities like London , Birmingham and Paris , because they will survive and receive support . #% We insist that the Commission and Council come forward in the near future with a proposal concerning the implemented regulation to ensure that the legitimate and genuine concerns raised by my colleagues -- and in particular by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten -- are taken on board and dealt with . #% I believe you should invite the Commissioner to come and give his views on the overwhelming crisis that we are going through at the present time . #% Robert McCartney was in the wrong place at the wrong time but this was no minor bar room brawl , as some have disgracefully attempted to portray it . #% On a point of order , Mrs Jackson 's question No 67 should have been taken with this . #% It calls for the right of residence in Europe of those subject to the travel ban to be rescinded , for members of their families to be barred from employment and educational institutions in the European Union , for high-profile economic links with Zimbabwe that have given the regime international prestige to be curtailed , for those providing financial backing to the ZANU-PF regime to be identified , and for measures to be imposed against them . #% Indeed , in Ireland recently we have created 130 , 000 jobs by our participation in the European activity . #% The voters and the media in the various Member States will be highlighting it . #% They show that the average fine in the United Kingdom was almost EUR 78 000 whereas the EU average was a mere EUR 4 500 . #% However , we need to play our part in finding ways to create fresh enthusiasm and acceptance for the roadmap as the way forward and , in this regard , the difficult task of engaging with Syria will be necessary . #% I would like to make a special plea to ensure that Member States ' veterinary services are properly resourced . #% She criticized my conduct when she said I sniggered at a comment made on the opinion given on the Wijsenbeek report . #% In Britain much of the anti-European rhetoric which has been unleashed following the government 's decision to adopt an obstructionist approach to European decision-making has been profoundly disturbing . #% His call for the EU to devote 10 % of our development aid to tackling this problem , his emphasis on preventative action with the 15-24 year-old age group in relation to AIDS , and his proposal for a global fund for infectious diseases and the establishment of an EU research agency should be the cornerstone of any new EU policy in this area . #% Your Commissioners are being tested on the same grounds . #% 
And the chief executives and managers of the multinationals who make the important decisions displaying the callous disregard for the consequences would face the proposal of not only seeing their businesses maybe in some cases closed down because of heavy fines and seizure of assets and so on , but they themselves could face imprisonment . #% In some places in Germany , mobile abattoirs are provided to slaughter animals if no abattoir is available locally . #% But the trap that Mr Pimenta has held up is evidence that this is a very nasty piece of work . #% The ` purchase for destruction ' scheme may be necessary in the short term but it is immoral and certainly alien to the ethos of farming . #% It has been a very good success for Parliament and indeed for the European citizens . #% When the European Council meets next week , it -- and the Commission -- will need to bear in mind that driving forward with market reforms without strengthening the democratic , social and environmental dimension of Europe , will feed the current crisis , and indeed , that strengthening nationalism will destroy Europe . #% For many workers - as you are aware , Commissioner - the picture is a dismal one , with unemployment increasing , working hours reduced , substantial pay cuts , the working poor you spoke of , and inadequate or non-existent training opportunities . #% Proposals and actions in this field should not simply be confined to the territory of the European Union . #% The Nuclear Inspectorate 's report stressed that the amount of high-level liquid waste continues to increase faster than BNFL can deal with it . #% Is the Council aware of the situation in Britain to which I have referred ? #% Did the EU Commission see the headline in the Financial Times yesterday : ` Traders in record bet against the euro ' ? #% I should be grateful , Mr President , if you would send our sympathy and condolences to his family on behalf of the Members of this Parliament . #% This is clearly discrimination . #% Even though many of us have criticised Serbia for its actions in the past , and maybe for some intransigence at the present time , it has legitimate concerns which must be responded to . #% Mr President , the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed leaders , like Musa Hilal , seem singularly immune to Western criticism . #% Mr President , I think that this is a very noble initiative and it shows Europe at its best . #% It is clear that injury places a heavy burden on the economy . #% All of the EU fishermen involved in this project need to be applauded for their dedication , which removes waste permanently from the sea , benefiting the fishing industry , wildlife and the environment . #% In 2003 , in the EU-25 commercial gaming industries , lotteries and casinos and betting services were worth some EUR 51.5 billion and there are some 2300 worldwide online casino sites . #% in writing . - One of the most pressing challenges in the current economic climate is that of youth unemployment . #% For a while that looked unlikely , so I thank everybody who worked so hard to ensure that it did . #% It is extremely important that Member States allow their citizens to have as great as possible a role in decision-making and that national parliaments should have the right to scrutinise all the EU institutions . #% In conclusion , while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process , Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward . #% Another matter which is of some concern to me is the implementation of equality between men and women and non-discrimination within the framework of the Fund . #% I invite it to do so again . #% Finally , Mr President , it is obvious we need further informed debates in helping to allay the citizens ' concern on the health aspect of incineration , a matter which has been addressed through extensive research carried out in various Member States and through the experience gained in the many state-of-the-art facilities now in operation throughout Europe . #% It is important in this context that the SAVE initiatives should be coordinated with other European Union energy initiatives such as THERMIE and SYNERGY . #% I strongly support the proposed amendments to the Commission 's text on respecting human rights and humanitarian need . #% This directive will force consumers to purchase these products on the Internet , where there are no controls . #% As you know , I am a great admirer of yours and I am sure that you were as uncomfortable repeating your answer today as I was hearing it . #% It happened when I saw disabled people protesting in the rain outside the transport company because of the fact that new buses had been acquired with EU structural fund money and that they were not accessible . #% There are scientists so arrogant today that they are already patenting their discoveries , as if they had stumbled upon their own creation . #% I have been encouraged by the growing influence that the European Union clearly has on many countries in the world . #% in writing . - At a time of serious economic and social crisis , we need to increase efforts to coordinate macro-economic and structural reform strategies across national borders so as to tackle the imbalances that hinder the generation of jobs . #% Yes , Mr Prodi , we need `` ambitious reforms of the European Union institutions '' . #% Unfortunately , it is the highest within this age group in the EU . #% May I congratulate Mrs Ahern on so enthusiastically taking up the work which Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz began . #% I call on Member States to encourage the development of national bioenergy action plans and welcome my own Government 's move towards encouraging bioenergy production and incentives in the transport sector , as evidenced in last week 's budget in my country . #% The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry . #% I support the objective underlying the question put by the honourable Member . #% It is not rational to make a cut in real terms in research in 1999 and the beginning of the next century . #% Mr President , I first wish to join with the other Members in condemning the terrible terrorist atrocity in Riyadh and offering sympathy to the bereaved and injured . #% All of this could now be prevented because a patent could be placed on the menu option , on the one-click option or in numerous other areas of operation . #% We , in the Parliament , must follow this issue along with Mr Lamy and other Commissioners until we get something that is appropriate to the age which we are moving into . #% We really have to take into account all sectors in the community . #% Industry has voluntarily proposed to limit the use of PFOA by 2014 , which in itself is a clear sign that our instincts were right to insist on its inclusion in the legislation . #% I am conscious of the need for continuity in the research area , both in terms of the integrity of the work being undertaken and the engagement of personnel on projects . #% As the Commissioner himself has said , it has not been defined as low-leakage or low-dispersal material . #% It is time to stop the political games and get on with the real agenda of making the Lisbon Strategy work , of ensuring that the people of Europe have better access to better-quality jobs and better-quality opportunities and of promoting Europe 's role on the wider stage . #% Mr President , I am a lawyer and I also worked in the insurance industry , but I did not expect to be leading the Socialists on this matter this evening . #% I believe that great credit is due to the Commission for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each and every one of the issues surrounding the original crisis . #% The last speaker said that a small-scale NATO is emerging . #% Galileo has proved to be a tremendous success and I hold the view that it is vital for Europe to continue to invest in this key technology into the future . #% Furthermore , the return to US unilateralism - especially evident in its perceived intention to extend the war on terrorism to Iraq - displays contempt for our role in international affairs . #% This is a positive debate , very positive for Europe , and widespread interest has been shown , as evidenced by the large number of amendments . #% You currently have two factories , but by having only one factory , you could increase productivity while reducing costs by # 150 million and protecting the environment . #% We are , of course , entering a period of intense debate on the future of the CAP , and I believe that this is a fundamental problem that should continue to be addressed in the context of a revised EU agricultural policy after 2013 . #% There has also been a great deal of upheaval and restructuring and some evidence of the formation of new monopolies , something which must be combated . #% I know Members would wish to discuss the issue , even if not to decide on it . #% So I very much hope that the administration in Strasbourg will ensure that we do not have to go through that again . #% I commend President Santer on his principled stand on this issue , defending the citizens of Europe . #% Madam President , those of us who have the responsibility of representing the agricultural sector of our individual countries must be concerned , if not alarmed , at the extent of the economic crisis experienced particularly by livestock farmers . #% Implementation at this time of this rail liberalisation package will involve the setting up of a complex administrative structure without enjoying the subsequent benefits that other Member States would . #% The way to do that is to transport the philosophy of the European Union to areas of conflict : dialogue developed there will enable agreement to be reached accordingly . #% I welcome the fact that in future health warnings will have to apply in relation to the manufacture of these products . #% The other point I should like to make is that so many people , by connecting these outbreaks of disease with the common agricultural policy , tend to somehow blame the CAP for the problem . #% 
There is little or no point in the European Union developing a trade policy based on liberal , free-market principles if our competitors continue to operate restrictive practices in their domestic markets . #% If our GNP goes down a percentage , our contribution to these people also goes down . #% The Parliament also has the final say as to whether or not international agreements such as the WTO talks are approved . #% Relations between the European Union and the United States are inextricably linked . #% Leadership : you have to show willpower , integrity and you have to show that you have very good eyes and ears and that you are a competent person . #% Therefore children can wander in , broadband is on and they can access the Internet straight away . #% The British Government has failed since 1989 to recognize the gravity of the situation . #% The cohesion fund and the structural funds will have to be tailored to a more simplified policy if we are to pursue an efficient regional policy , particularly in the enlarged European Union . #% I would suggest that Europol would be a very appropriate place to have this centralized agency capable of responding within 24 hours . #% in writing . - As elected representatives , everyone in this Chamber will be aware of the many sacrifices which our constituents and national governments have had to make over the past three years . #% I therefore especially welcome his statement today . #% I have to say that I am slightly disappointed because I have not heard any real proposal . #% Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East . #% That could convince people that Europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentrates and soaks up more powers , more decisions , more authority . #% There must also be respect for the Members of this House in their work and for the style in which they work . #% The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union . #% I agree with the views set out in the EU White Paper on growth , competitiveness and employment that biotechnology is one of the technologies which will determine the future of European competitiveness . #% With regard to Romania and the situation of children in Romanian institutions , orphanages and foster homes , more work needs to be done ; more action needs to be taken to treat those children as individual human beings with human rights . #% The full extent of the EUROPOL convention can not be enforced unless this procedure is completed and it is a poor example to the applicant states if we ourselves can not complete the ratification process . #% When they are in place , the third principle will come into play : working together in common interests , spilling sweat and not blood . #% It would be ideal if companies were to take their responsibilities seriously in terms of prompt payment but we know that is not the case and therefore minimum legislation is necessary to improve the business culture and ensure fair and good practice . #% I am extremely disappointed that the Council , in this way , would want to wash its hands of what is a very serious matter . #% In this context , I am pleased to see that credit unions , cooperative banks and other mutual financial institutions can operate the fund , because they are often closer to those who may wish to access this particular facility . #% Delays at this stage are unacceptable and Parliament must keep up the pressure on the Council and on Member States to conform fully with our revised food laws . #% She correctly makes the point that the Commission communication does not comply with the requirements laid down in the Sixth Environmental Action Plan for concrete targets and timetables . #% Rather than face reality , I fear that we will again face a Brussels conspiracy to circumvent the people . #% I am arguing today that human cloning is about the wealth of certain scientists and their companies . #% Animal feed or , more appropriately , the ingredients used in its manufacture are understandably central to the regulations governing food safety and consumer protection . #% However , right now there must be an insistence that those who cold-bloodedly murdered Mr McCartney and those who witnessed it should cooperate fully with the police service of Northern Ireland . #% The forms that it is replacing -- E111 , E128 , E110 , and E119 -- sound more like food additives than health passports , but I am pleased that this card will now replace those in good time . #% I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office on her first session here in Parliament and thank her for her honesty . #% To date the only effective method of killing the mosquito is by the use of DDT . #% What we are calling for is the suspension of that agreement , not a suspension of all contact with Israel , but a suspension of the preferential arrangements that Europe has with Israel so that at least it will begin to recognise that we are prepared to take action . #% I should like to point out that the name indicated as signing for the Liberal Group , the Lord Bethell , is most welcome to join our Group . #% To this end , I have proposed an oral question to the Commission , to which I hope to get a response at some stage : would it not agree that the arms race is directing resources away from development and the reduction of poverty to the military-industrial complex , and would it not agree that the imposition of sanctions in these circumstances amounts to no more than the punishment of the powerless for the sins of the powerful ? #% As rapporteur on the REGI Committee , I strongly urge that the appropriations in the preliminary draft budget be restored and that cohesion be considered one of the policy priorities of the EU . #% However , the suggestion that a small group of Member States could forge ahead , creating a two-speed Europe , is vastly different in scope . #% With this in mind , I welcome this report as it shows best practice from the European experience and we can see what that is applicable to in Sub-Saharan Africa . #% That is what the whole principle of the European project is about . #% I understand why the same public is now asking why they should fund bail-outs in other countries . #% We debated this report in the Subcommittee on Human Rights on 23 November 2004 , again on 31 January 2005 and on 17 March -- St Patrick 's Day -- 2005 . #% Through EU-level and Member state incentives , we must seriously target the development and mainstreaming of the 21 types of renewables , not least because of our obligations in relation to climate change . #% I should like to finish by saying that it is a job well done by the UN today , and I think it will add credibility to its stance on human rights issues . #% We now have before us the best prospects for a generation of building lasting peace and prosperity across the whole of south-east Europe and the European Union is prepared to play an active role in this regard . #% He has raised a number of issues which merit further consideration . #% I have a question for Mr Mandelson on the same issue , so perhaps he might oblige and answer the question privately ? #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , this report presents many positive things about the EU , for instance what it is doing to promote human rights and democracy . #% in writing . - I do not agree with direct-to-consumer advertising in relation to pharmaceutical products . #% I do not question the genuineness of it , but I do question the genuineness of the way in which this Parliament acts on such concerns . #% Genetic modification by itself is not harmful and it is wrong for us to confuse the public by suggesting that it is . #% If we are really to have a non-military as well as military capacity , an effective voice at the Security Council table would be important especially in our outreach beyond Europe itself . #% There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions . #% The report naively gives the impression that if you have some sort of democratic control , all will be okay . #% The honourable Member raises some interesting questions . #% Mr President , a single currency should result in lower interest rates in many parts of the European Union . #% How can we describe the bombing of Qana except as a war crime ? #% We voted against this paragraph . #% These people will not know their rights , not have legal representation . #% The sad truth is that Mr Slobodan Milosevic is the only leader in Europe today with a clear vision for Kosovo and the political will and military means to see it through . #% We also have to look at NATO where there needs to be a review because , as far as I can see , the US has demonstrated quite clearly its contempt for the whole issue of nuclear disarmament at an international level . #% However , they should withdraw this proposal , return to the drawing-board and ensure there is mandatory self-handling which would provide for prior authorisation and would include criteria relating to employment , the social aspects , professional qualifications and environmental considerations . #% The purpose of the mid-term review reform is to promote competitiveness while securing the income of farmers in a situation where payments would no longer be coupled to production . #% That is unfortunately what is happening in Ireland at the moment , as a result of the failure of the Irish Government to properly implement this posting of workers directive . #% Council Directive 2000/78/EC rightly prohibits religious discrimination in employment . #% That area was also closed when the Norwegians were working on the project , and scientists came forward with new conclusions that did not affect the industry . #% The technology is there to provide suitable treatment to sufferers of this disease . #% 
Madam President , I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this report incorporating equal opportunities for women and men in all Community policies and activities . #% Finally , could I point very briefly to where we should go in the future . #% At the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution . #% The wildly varying climates in the various EU Member States are enough to make it clear that European legislation on natural optical radiation is not appropriate . #% I am , however , very disappointed that previous Amendments Nos 95 , 76 and 78 which were debated and agreed on by this Parliament have re-emerged in the context of the proposal before the House . #% They have all failed to implement the framework directive . #% Here again , the capacity of smaller Member States to act as honest brokers , mediating between larger states , was well illustrated and underlined by the Irish presidency with the assistance , as has been acknowledged here today , of the Luxembourg Prime Minister . #% I ask the Commissioner , whom I have personally great faith in and in his ability to achieve things within the Commission , to press for an embargo of this kind in the region . #% Why is the European Union not ensuring that sanctions are imposed ? #% Mr President , for the food sector , food safety and quality must surpass all other considerations . #% Despite some of the very serious issues that have been raised here this evening , we did not hold the workers hostage and we approved the EUR 14.8 million application . #% If the Police Service of Northern Ireland is unable to bring a prosecution , the EU could grant a financial contribution from the budget line for aid for the victims of terrorism to assist the McCartney family to mount civil proceedings in its search for the truth . #% The common position as drafted presents a major problem for my Member State , Ireland , regarding Article 67 on prescription-only medicines for veterinary purposes . #% Every citizen wants action on radioactive waste . #% If the intention of using contract workers is that the monitoring , which must be long-term monitoring , does not need to take place , this is unacceptable . #% We often hear in this House and other establishments about the idea of lifelong learning . #% I therefore welcome the announcement today by the Commissioner that implants have been reclassified as medical devices , and the effects that will have on how they may be controlled . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , the committee and the political groups requested that we vote on compromise amendment 4 first , as it is the amendment that was agreed with the Council and the Commission in the trialogue . #% If they did not exist there would be many more millions of people on the breadline . #% I did so in the belief that this would have restricted research to stem cells extracted from the human embryo ( i.e. the embryo has already been destroyed ) prior to 31.12.2003 and that new human embryos could not be created and then destroyed for research purposes . #% Mr President , I want to thank the rapporteurs for their work and say that they have found a decent consensus and produced good reports . #% And I would like to emphasise that research and development should be a public service obligation , because in a free market research is one of the areas that is most at risk . #% We need an intensive dialogue between times and some intermediate staging-posts at which to make evaluations . #% There is a need for better coordination of human and veterinarian research on resistance , as well as further research on new antibiotics , alternative treatments and animal disease prevention and control practices . #% The Council recommendation to the House , consistent with the Treaty , commends a term of office of eight years for Mr Wim Duisenberg as nominee for Central Bank presidency . #% That is to be welcomed . #% It is a crucial issue and it will decide whether or not we grow beet this year -- perhaps the last season for beet growing in Ireland . #% I share this concern with my colleagues , Mr De Rossa and Mr McCartin . #% I am sure the President-in-Office will also be aware of the potential impact of the WTO on an eventual CAP agreement . #% That document indicates that liberalisation in general is having a net beneficial effect , but I would suggest to the Commission that they need to come forward with a lot more research and hard evidence in relation to specific sectors to convince me that it is true in all cases . #% This measure will only exacerbate problems in the aviation sector . #% During the lunch break several Members from different groups across the House came to me and gave a different interpretation to what I had said , stating that they had felt personally insulted and aggrieved by my remarks . #% I have spoken on this many times in this House over the last 20 years . #% The Cologne Council directed the Finnish government , as the office-holder of the Presidency , to establish the conditions for the implementation of this project in time for the Tampere Summit . #% The kind of model that has been successful for Europe has been one that we have created ourselves . #% We still have states that welsh on their commitments to reach the development aid target of 0.7 % of GDP , which has been in place for decades . #% In my view , no deal better than a bad deal . #% The growth of this industry in some Member States is to be applauded , but it must be acknowledged that some Member States have provided less financial support than others . #% Business-to-business communications are doing well but we must enhance communications between business and consumers in the European Union , where we lag behind the United States . #% Finally , I call on the Commission to clarify the legal base of the peace programme and enable resources to be allocated to the International Fund for Ireland . #% I presume that negotiations are already proceeding for the next agreement , as this one expires in June . #% I know that the Commission and members of the Council have consulted with the Association of Scheduled Airlines which represents the larger airlines in Europe , but no charter airlines were consulted , no airport managers were consulted and no ferry companies were consulted . #% In fact , one must welcome the recent position of the Internal Affairs Council of Ministers ' meeting , at which it was agreed that the procedural red-tape would be cut , to allow the European Commission to demand reasonable action by Member States to unblock roads or ports within days of blockades being set up as a result of strikes , or face action in the European Court of Justice . #% Yet until the EU is able to come to grips with the severity of the problem of discards , and accepts that they are both unnecessary and wasteful , no real progress will be made . #% I certainly hope that the end result of all this legislation is to increase the responsibility of food business operators both in primary production and in subsequent stages of production . #% The crux of the discussions is the relationship between intellectual property rights and public health issues . #% I am convinced that we must go further in seeking international partners who will be pleased to find alternative options to the previous monopolies . #% They are innovative and visionary and are an appropriate response to the changing circumstances in which we live . #% I am aware that criminal law is essentially a Member State competence and we must avoid taking a position that would seek to infringe Member States ' rights in this area . #% Benefits will flow from that . #% The Ombudsman very correctly ensures that all of those complaints are redirected to those bodies which can provide some redress for citizens , whether that is the Petitions Committee , the national Ombudsman offices , or other national institutions . #% Many Member States have a major problem with the military component and it is very cynical to say that we want to help the social area when clearly this plan is a military plan . #% Too many people still live in unacceptable conditions in Romania 's institutions . #% Regulation 615/98 links all payments of export refunds to compliance with strict animal welfare standards during transport , including full clinical examination of every animal . #% Specifically , I will concentrate my remarks on two things . #% Negotiations which took place at the Nice Summit with regard to this issue guaranteed that unanimity was retained for decisions on all taxation questions at EU level . #% I thank you for your reply , Commissioner , but can you tell me how one is meant to have confidence in the single market if Equitable Life can get away with treating ordinary people in this way ? #% Mr President , as Mr De Rossa has pointed out it is expected that the Seville Summit will discuss the holding of a second Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by saying how much I welcome this debate and I congratulate the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy on its initiative . #% All these new measures create extra costs , at a time when we have reduced fishing and have a fleet that is , to some extent , in financial difficulty . #% Anyone who has taken the time to look at the exhibition must have been impressed by one of his statements and I quote , `` For me the world is not made up of nations , but of people . '' #% At the end of the day , the GMO industry does not have anything to offer the consumer or the environment , even as regards the use of chemicals . #% Mr President , I must confess that when I first heard of the Ariane project , I thought ` What on earth are we talking about ? ' #% If sugar beet is sacrificed today , as it has been in Ireland , what about EU beef farming tomorrow ? #% To date the International Fund for Ireland has contributed EUR 803 million of funding and has leveraged a further EUR 1.46 billion in supporting 5700 projects and the creation of 55 000 direct and indirect jobs . #% Racist violence , alas , is now prevalent throughout Europe and must be vigorously addressed . #% 
I mention this simply to indicate that I am fully aware of the benefits that carefully-developed tourism can bring to a region . #% The main focus of this resolution is to nudge the international community forward , to ensure that Burma is put on the UN Security Council agenda as soon as possible . #% I herald the confidence-building measures proposed in this report , in particular the joint monitoring cell for the sharing of data on seismic activity to provide early warning against possible earthquakes . #% I would hope that the Commission will look again at what it is proposing and come forward with a maximum journey time , rather than this situation where animals can continue to travel long distances with periods of rest . #% This is akin to Enron 's creative accounting . #% The question we have to ask is : what can Europe do to provide an effective response to the need to protect our children from violence , abductions , paedophile rings , Internet abuse and other exploitation ? #% That should be unthinkable . #% We should also use our influence to ensure a proper balance is struck between providing short term relief and undertaking long term reconstruction . #% This presents you with the challenge of finding a common approach . #% Mr President , I will omit replying to that particular remark . #% We must prevent divisions , divisions between the regions of Europe , between the households of Europe and between the individuals of Europe . #% We have to try a lot harder at European Union level if we are to convince everybody . #% Indeed , according to estimates , carbon dioxide accounts for 50 % of the greenhouse gases now present in the atmosphere . #% That is what we are now doing in our attempt to rectify the rural-urban imbalance which we have allowed to develop over a period of years . #% The nuclear package represents a coordinated effort to prepare for further development of atomic power in an enlarged European Union and it has been stripped of all meaningful safety requirements . #% I believe my colleagues are wrong when they say we should not use this as a debate on the role of China . #% The European Union , as we all know , has a population of 370 million and , with enlargement , the Union 's population will rise to 500 million . #% One central feature of this report was that a reformed CAP should be simplified and the policy streamlined . #% But I will ensure that the concerns raised here today are brought to the attention of the President-in-Office of the Council . #% We all know the figures and the scale of the humanitarian consequences of insufficient action by the international community . #% The Commissioner himself has already outlined the important issues at stake . #% Mr President , one quarter of the Irish GDP is tied up in construction . #% Finally , we have tabled an amendment introducing the principle of positive discrimination in R & D for the poorer regions . #% I very much welcome the decision of the Irish Government , which last night established a national forum on Europe . #% The response of the governments around the world has also been good . #% Nonetheless , we do consider that Member States should define adequacy as the condition required for older people to live a decent life . #% I too tabled amendments to abolish the 16-week rule . #% For far too long consumers have been influenced by marketing and advertising , much of which was without any basis . #% I fully support the prosecution of such crime while ensuring that the freedoms and legal rights of individuals are protected . #% It remains to be seen whether its medium - and long-term measures will be any better . #% My second question relates to a comment the Commissioner made earlier in the debate when she said that the 10 % which is being set aside under the restructuring scheme for growers could be increased by Member States in particular circumstances . #% We , in Parliament , are well-intentioned towards the people of Iraq and are serious in our desire for a peaceful and lasting solution . #% Since it was first recorded in 1997 , avian flu strain H5N1 has undergone multiple reassortments -- more than 17 mutations -- and evolved at high speed to the point where , in January 2003 , the ` z ' virus emerged . #% Trusting Member States is fine , but trust has always to be earned and if there are concerns , I believe they need to be dealt with . #% I believe that those countries which are currently net beneficiaries from the funds will have great difficulty in accepting such a proposal in March . #% We need to protect these industries which create jobs and boost our economy - not just locally , but in the European domain . #% The Israeli Government does not serve the interests of the Palestinian masses , nor of the Israeli working class . #% For example , it is estimated that over 70 million polyester bottles are sold in Ireland each year and the improper disposal of even a very small proportion of these could make a significant contribution to environmental litter . #% Mothers can not be fathers and fathers can not be mothers . #% This will require an even-handed capacity to deal with all the regional political powers . #% It is in all our interests that a multilateral framework be put in place to govern the trading relations of the 150 different members of the WTO at this time . #% I get the impression that , especially where biofuels are concerned , there is no lack of interest : the research and investment communities are circling , but afraid to take a leap in the dark . #% If we are to expect that suddenly action will be taken because of the horrific gunning-down of Anna Politkovskaya in recent days , I think we are like ostriches sticking our heads in the sand . #% A final comment : without farmers there would be no environment . #% Mr President , much work has been achieved in recent weeks to accelerate the enlargement process , but a number of difficulties have to be overcome before EU enlargement becomes a practical reality . #% Accordingly , given our history of success in conflict resolution in Europe , would it not be a very good thing if , during the Irish presidency , you were to persuade the Commission to set up a special department of peace and reconciliation so that , instead of sending armies to areas of conflict , a team of people equipped with the European Union 's philosophy and principles is dispatched to those areas , since today we are in a stronger position to shape the world ? #% One can only imagine the trauma that these captives and their families have gone through and are still experiencing . #% Mr President , I have always accepted the need for a review of the common agricultural policy 's sugar regime , but I object to the total destruction of the sugar industry in my country and in other EU Member States . #% While the EU is committed to closely monitoring and regulating the industry , there is , in my view , a moral responsibility on those involved to agree on standards which it is not acceptable to exceed . #% Up to 30 000 lives were lost in the capital alone that day and the event signalled the decline of the city , which until then had been the fourth largest city in Europe and one of the richest . #% While acknowledging the weight of the scientific evidence on the connection of BSE and CJD with the use of meat and bonemeal , it must be borne in mind that the level of BSE infestation proportionate to the individual herds in Member States is significantly small and is of course confined to a relatively short production cycle . #% As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union . #% Madam President , I should like to welcome Commissioner Kyprianou here this evening and say that we look forward to welcoming him to the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . #% We are also considerably advanced in relation to the most modern technology in identifying all our other animals . #% Airlines need to take responsibility for their passengers . #% Under no circumstances , having secured additional commitments from the Council and recognizing the critical importance of the Stability and Growth Pact to EMU , will my group be prepared to postpone the vote tomorrow . #% Basically , what I am saying is this : we need to tackle this issue head-on . #% Furthermore , I would very strongly support a suggestion to publish a document outlining , on the one hand , what is already in place in the existing Treaties and , on the other , outlining what is new , changed or different . #% Some colleagues may have confused harmonisation of the tax base with the harmonisation of company accounts and requirements for transparency between companies and their accounts . #% So five or six people had questions down to Commissioner Byrne , but none of us were here to ask the questions . #% We really need to ask whether the economic model of plundering natural resources , without any regard for the people or the ecology , is acceptable . #% The gap in employment rates between women and men is narrowing but women are still more likely to be in part-time jobs and/or on fixed-term contracts and , for the most part , to remain stuck in poorly paid posts . #% I accused the Commissioner of being obstinate and arrogant at the public hearing which Parliament held . #% Quite honestly , ECHO needs more than a political infusion : it needs somebody to see what is going on there . #% Some of the rapporteur 's conclusions are very disturbing . #% However , my political conviction is reinforced that whatever happens in the Court of Justice , which we must respect , the Intergovernmental Conference must change the rules for social policy to avoid being taken hostage by individual states . #% 
It does not exercise the public mind an awful lot in the European Union . #% But what is the future to be ? #% Will we see to it that these little communities - and they are tiny compared with the big fishing industries of the rest of the Community but vital to us all - are safeguarded ? #% The consumers do not want GM food , so why are we being forced into it just for the benefit of multinational companies ? #% It was never the responsibility of the farmer , it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again . #% I have to say bluntly to the Commission that if it can not get the policy right in the next four to five years , then it will be forced to hand it back to national governments . #% Was a recommendation an even-handed and proportionate response ? #% I broadly welcome this report and I want to focus in particular on Amendment No 20 , Recital 26 ( new ) , which states that the Commission will consider proposals for the establishment of a Centralised Electronic European Union Causebook and Judgment Registry Database . #% I come from a country where we are very proud of our public services . #% Thirdly , the EU leaders in Brussels on 24 October 2002 endorsed the findings of the European Commission that 10 countries fulfil the necessary political and economic criteria to assume membership of the EU by 2004 . #% Our inconsistency is a form of political prostitution and undermines our moral authority in this field . #% As far as trade is concerned , we agree that a new WTO round is desirable , again subject to the constraints of sustainable development . #% If we add to this lost national revenues and damage to the environment and to biodiversity we see that Mexico 's experience of seeking to develop its agricultural sector through trade liberalisation has had devastating consequences . #% It is no secret that Article 9 , and the right of boards to take defensive action without shareholder approval , was the bone of contention in conciliation . #% But we can work towards it and we are getting there . #% When the overall aspects of the different economies within the European Union and throughout the world are considered , those which have created the best and most numerous jobs are those which focus on five key issues . #% As far as radioactive waste is concerned , there is no agreed solution . #% It is vitally important that this trend is reversed and that we accelerate the progress of the peace negotiations . #% This type of programme is an inspiration to what can be done for rural areas by fully exploiting new technologies . #% His biographer has said in regard to the Euratom Treaty that he thought that nuclear power had a great future and no past , and neither assertion was true . #% He is accountable to this Parliament - we should not overlook that . #% in writing . - I want to draw attention to the proposal in this report for a financial transaction tax ( FTT ) . #% Such an exemption should be granted to benefit UK meat producers in terms of cost reduction and alleviation from burdensome procedures by removing the need for separate batching at each stage of the production process . #% This right is limited to their own waters , at least so the Commission said in January when it more or less forced Sweden to exploit the depleted cod stocks in the Baltic and the North Sea . #% Plans are now being rewritten for Ireland and are practically ready for resubmission and so it is likely that this case will be dropped . #% Liberalization should apply to all energy sectors , particularly the nuclear sector where there are huge subsidies from some states . #% It was clear that our laws had failed to properly protect consumers . #% Why has the Commission gone down the route of a voluntary approach ? #% I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Secretariat , and to say that safety is something that affects us all . #% After the first reading , the Council accepted 16 of the committee 's 26 amendments , which included the provision that the depositing of proof of insurance in one Member State should suffice for all Member States . #% For this reason , I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises . #% The Council needs to get its act together . #% If terrorists were to get hold of this material we would be facing devastation . #% I hope it will be sustained . #% I have three points to make in this debate . #% Madam President , I rise to support the remarks of Mr de Rossa and Mrs McKenna with regard to the horrific situation and tragedy in Wexford , Ireland . #% After all , the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies . #% I have tabled this question because the new guidelines of the IAEA appear to be designed specifically to accommodate the air transport of MOX fuel and this has not been defined as low-leakage or low-dispersal material , as the Commission itself has stated . #% In software , the great ideas of yesterday are the building blocks of the great ideas of tomorrow . #% Our European partners have declared that the Nice Treaty does not impose any defence commitments on any Member State of the European Union . #% For example , the leader of our own government in Ireland , Mr Ahern , is only a recent convert to the duty-free cause . #% That is why we would like to see both and , in particular , impact assessments or evaluations of where we went wrong . #% I believe it is essential that the EU clean up these aspects of its fisheries if it is to be committed to a sustainable fisheries policy . #% The response from European citizens and their record generosity and solidarity have been immense . #% Indonesia itself must facilitate the work of relief agencies and the international forces so as to ensure that peace and stability return to the area . #% I think the two more important points , as mentioned by the Commissioner herself in her address , are , firstly , the question of finance : it is vital for any programme that it be properly budgeted for and given the resources to ensure that all can benefit from it . #% While medical treatments are improving , and while standards of care , standards of treatment and the cost of such care are paramount in our concerns , if one can prevent transmission of such diseases , then we may go a long way to reducing the number of those affected . #% Mr President , there is no military solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people . #% This is not a precautionary approach to fisheries management . #% As such , it is imperative that this issue is addressed on a European level . #% Any future debate here should follow the debate in our own country . #% It is not live beef , as some people have said , it is live animals which feel pain just as we do . #% I believe that , while each Member State must work towards the 12 % target of renewables , the imposition of a single binding target would not be helpful because of the great differences in the structure of the energy market between Member States . #% Mr President , we all have to totally condemn the nuclear testing by both Pakistan and India , but we also have to look to ourselves - the responsibilities that the European Union holds and the fact that France , not so very long ago , carried out its nuclear tests despite opposition from right round the world . #% Long-term , Europe needs to exercise greater vigilance in relation to world trade - which is now under consideration - and how decisions taken there impact on our processors and on our farmers . #% in writing . - I voted to oppose the measures in this report relating to the Mercosur Trade deal . #% Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has outlined to us in detail the importance of the multi-functional role of the EU fisheries . #% The state of emergency in Pakistan must be lifted immediately and the Government of Pakistan must respect the boundaries of its Constitution . #% Secondly , we already know that the vote which we are about to take in favour of the Commission 's proposal has , in fact , has already been bypassed by a political understanding in Ecofin . #% Mr President , Mrs Wallis ' report is an important contribution to the debate on Community policy on out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes . #% I led an SR Technics delegation to meet Commissioner Špidla in mid-2009 , when the availability of this fund was confirmed to us . #% The PSE Group has therefore tabled an amendment asking the Commission to work in consultation with consumer groups and industry to ensure the clear and unambiguous execution of the information requirements . #% Is that an acceptable way to continue ? #% Save us from the oppressive uniformity that some would impose upon us and let the needs of each rule the day . #% ` We are writing to express our disappointment about the content of the Declaration on the final text of the Fluorinated Gas Regulation made unilaterally by the Commission in the course of the European Parliament plenary session of 4 April 2006 . #% I very much regret this but I must condemn a statement made by Ireland 's Minister for Justice last Monday , where he accused those who argue for a more rational and open immigration policy of simply proposing an open door policy on immigration . #% 
Now , with avian influenza , they are recognising the hallmarks of such a virus . #% We welcome the breakthrough in a statute to establish an international criminal court as a permanent structure to bring to justice those charged with crimes against humanity and urge that the preparatory work proceed . #% The scientists blame the fishermen , the fishermen blame the scientists and we try to find a way through . #% As regards an analysis of the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people , I believe it is essential to include an analysis of the role of the family or lack of family in the young person ' s development . #% His family have no information on the state of his health , either physical health or mental health . #% Macro-economic policy such as structural adjustment programmes should be brought into line with the requirements of guaranteeing long-term food security for all . #% Mr Novo 's call on the Commission and the Council to guarantee that the Cohesion Fund will continue as of 1999 receives my full and unambiguous support . #% Either the research is acceptable and respectful of human life and the dignity of humankind or it is not . #% Citizens throughout Europe have a right to have these products circulating freely in the Member States under single market rules as much as any other product , provided that all considerations of safety and efficacy are properly applied . #% The EU monitoring and advocacy programme of the Open Society Institute has stated that there is a total absence of reliable , comprehensive data on mentally disabled persons in Romania , which has contributed to a general lack of public attention to people with intellectual disabilities . #% Mr President , I ask your indulgence to invite my colleagues who have not yet signed the declaration on autism to do so . #% I am convinced that a united European Union could have stopped this war , could have disarmed Saddam Hussein , and indeed could have played an important role in bringing peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians . #% In particular , I note the strategic leadership which you offered through the Council at the extraordinary meeting on 21 September . #% The charge is that Ireland is to seek to achieve economic stability and , in that context , our last budget was deemed to be over-inflationary . #% I am particularly satisfied that the European Parliament has rejected the Commission 's proposal to re-brand municipal waste incinerators based on certain criteria . #% To put it quite simply , I would suggest that it is better to be safe in the short term than sorry in the long term . #% Refugees have died in holding pens in modern-day Europe , without sanitation or proper services . #% However , there are no international or even European regulations on shark-fishing and these species are also in some cases over-fished . #% In spite of the scathing references of many Eurosceptics , I do not claim this draft Constitution to be the Holy Grail or the Second Coming , but it is a positive step forward for Europe and one that I will support . #% Secondly , we did a deal on the basis of 6 000 tonnes of tuna . #% In addition , we must ensure that the list of specialities included in the proposal is comprehensive enough to ensure due recognition and regulatory protection is accorded to emerging disciplines , such as medical oncology -- the whole area of the research and treatment of cancer . #% We are going to get more bureaucracy , more red tape - and when you talk about greening the first pillar , what do you mean ? #% We must protect our public service broadcasting . #% Mr Trichet , can you give us the facts on the inflationary effects or otherwise of abolishing the 1 and 2 cent coins ? #% Mr President , the restoration of consumer confidence in beef is central to this particular issue . #% In the area of rural development , there have been very significant initiatives in my own country , Ireland , to utilise EU funding such as through Leonardo to develop courses tailored to the needs of the rural economy . #% This proposal replaces the mechanism in operation since 1993 for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating progress towards meeting commitments in respect of these emissions . #% If we had an equivalent to the Euratom Treaty - I would call it the Eurenew Treaty , a treaty on renewable energy - we could do something . #% Approaching this with anything less than caution would be an insult to the people of my home country and of all of Europe who are facing their own budgetary concerns . #% They have progressed greatly in the recent past in changing laws , in amending systems that are decades old , to try and bring about a more realistic approach . #% It can be complementary to the activities going on there and can help to improve the economy of the European Union at a time when unemployment is once again becoming a problem . #% Vocational education and training should be accessible , available and affordable at all times of life , regardless of the people 's status on the labour market or of their income . #% There is absolutely no reason why the Commission should not buy into that code of good administrative behaviour , so that we would have a common code for all three institutions . #% Mr President , poor Mr Vitorino has one of the most difficult jobs in the Commission and he does it extremely well . #% Young farmers face enormous problems such as the massive financial burden when they start up and often this can be compounded by difficulties associated with inheritance . #% Without a doubt the Novo report is exceptionally important . #% We must also be firm in our commitment to honour the Kyoto Treaty and to go beyond the rhetoric of environmental protection . #% Negotiations surrounding ACTA need to be more open , and the Commission and Council need to show their willingness in this by ensuring Parliament has broad access to documents on the issue . #% Madam President , I did not want to interrupt the voting when I arrived a little bit late . #% We have , as you say , a single market . #% I therefore anticipate a resounding rejection of the Nice Treaty in the Irish referendum this Summer because of this unwarranted interference and because this is a very bad treaty , as many in this House agree . #% That is why we believe this is the wrong method to move forward and one that should be ignored . #% Firstly , concerning the time in which Member States must report back to the Commission on their experience in implementing the recommendation - the Council can accept our suggested 45 months . #% I believe that imaginative gestures must be the order of the day if the roadmap is to have any chance of survival . #% I would appeal to other states to do so . #% However , in reality , unless they are working in parallel and in coordination with each other , maximum results will not be achieved , i.e. maximum economic growth and development and maximum employment of those ideals . #% From the Irish perspective , we will have more confidence in the British regulatory authorities if they reject this application in its totality . #% Mr President , I should firstly like to express my thanks for the cooperation I received in the preparation of this report , not only from the Commission but also from colleagues on the committee , where we were involved in extremely good cooperation in bringing forward compromise amendments . #% If the outcome of the IGC is to be ratified successfully it must also secure the consent of other institutions such as the European Parliament , the European Commission and members of national parliaments . #% Secondly , it is essential that the Commission steps up measures to support the livestock sector in less-favoured areas , in particular . #% I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions , including the Commission and Parliament . #% We must take steps to ensure that labelling does not result in a renationalisation of the food sector . #% Mr President , I wish to restate here this morning my confidence in Commissioner Fischler 's handling of the BSE crisis . #% Since we have been able to control our fertility , women can now choose to have one child , no children or ten children . #% That is also somewhat surrealistic . #% The report points to a real way forward , in the fields both of preparation and deterrence . #% I do not view the document as perfect by any means , however , and I would be critical on two points in particular . #% Society , as this House knows , is a much wider concept than the economy , and that must be our starting-point . #% One other point : where I come from , in recent years there has been a continuing downward trend . #% I attended the Doha Round of talks in Hong Kong last December and before that those in Cancún , and I informed this Parliament of the false impression that is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to EU markets . #% We are not the body which will carry out any sort of trial on that man . #% These reports dovetail nicely with yesterday 's Commission communication on ` The new generation of education and training programmes ' setting out future programmes intended to replace the current Socrates , Leonardo da Vinci , Tempus , Youth , Culture 2000 and Media Plus from 2007 . #% People go to the cinema more often in Ireland than in any other EU country . #% This is certainly a matter of common interest for Member States and it does indeed complement the workings of the internal market . #% To ask the Election Commission to investigate election malpractice is like asking Saddam Hussein to head the UN weapons inspection team in Iraq . #% We need this information to analyse fully what is happening . #% 
One of the fundamental characteristics of temporary protection is that it is not a right established by any international instrument . #% Parliament can not be expected to make important decisions on such matters unless the necessary and appropriate information has been forwarded to the Members for their consideration . #% As society stands in the vast majority of Member States , it does not favour the participation of women in the workforce . #% Therefore it is important that Basel II upholds current market practice in the covered bond area . #% It is unfortunate that the PSE Group did not support us on this . #% The United Nations Security Council should also authorise the deployment of UN human rights monitors throughout Iraq . #% The objective of this new directive is to contribute to the improvement of air safety by ensuring that essential safety information is reported and collected , stored , protected and disseminated in order to facilitate its effective analysis and monitoring . #% We all have concerns that Plan Colombia might escalate the conflict and increase the influence of the guerrillas out there . #% It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the application of the arrangements in any particular case or cases , or by any individual Member State . #% This will be a great opportunity . #% In China , with a population of 1 1/2 billion , the scale of the problem is different , but China has made enormous progress on the economic side . #% Each category of waste should be subject to treatment which is specific to it . #% We can not continue to accept this situation . #% I now want to congratulate the Greek authorities on the excellent Olympic Games and to express my disgust at the suggestion of the outgoing President of the Commission that in future games the European Union flag should be flown alongside the national flag . #% Some will have to stay with their boats tied up watching fishermen from other nationalities fish their very shores . #% The real difficulty is that we have no forum , as Members of this democratically elected assembly , where we can discuss our concerns and fears , be they real or perceived , and agree or disagree amongst ourselves in a democratic way on this issue . #% What we have seen is a brutal regime taking a terrible revenge on a small country that dared to say it wanted to be independent and we must support it . #% We may be reaching the point where this resource is tendered and paid for and the public can get some compensation from those who get rich very quickly - they are already doing this in New Zealand . #% Most importantly of all , if history has taught us anything - through the example of the establishment of the European Union or conflict resolution in other areas of the European continent - it is that only by having better and closer relations with our neighbours can we achieve what can truly be called a just and lasting peace . #% We had beef mountains , we had butter mountains , we had milk lakes and we had cereal mountains . #% Clearly the problems of the telecoms sector have been difficult for satellites in the European Union . #% I have two other points . #% However the underlying thesis is correct . #% Given that a five-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer 's means 50 % less prevalence rates , I welcome the focus on prevention and early detection by the Commission . #% This new directive , together with the existing Directive 89/381/EEC , will ensure that binding Community legislation will apply now to blood and blood products whatever the intended purpose . #% When you fail to win the argument , you then attack the man : you carry out a personal attack because of his accent , because of the way in which he expresses himself . #% We have one of the main links between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland between Dublin and Belfast . #% Trafficking in human beings is now the world 's fastest growing criminal business . #% I would urge the Commission to underpin the decentralisation process by creating a Europe-wide network of regional advisory committees . #% It is not , however , good enough just to pay lip service to their work . #% We underline once again that the Commission under the Treaties has an obligation to make available to Parliament all the necessary information . #% The principal benefit of a single European currency for Ireland is the prospect of a lower trend in interest rates . #% Famagusta is a city on the east coast of Cyprus . #% Commissioner , as one of the busiest commissioners it is a matter of some fascination to me that this particular directive should come out of the pile , given the workload you have . #% I congratulate Mrs Stihler on her excellent report , which supports the main thrust of the Commission 's plans , as would I or anyone who has the slightest interest in conservation . #% At a time when the industry is on its knees with farmers facing bankruptcy and workers in the industry losing their jobs , it is disgraceful that the Council of Ministers is unable to reach an agreement on a compensation package . #% On behalf of my group I would like to make a few brief points on this area . #% Secondly , the Council will consider the report of the Intergovernmental Conference as a Council of Ministers and the various Member States will put forward their views . #% There are huge economic implications for Ireland from this disease and while farmers are suffering badly , because of restriction of movements and slaughtering , so are other businesses and industries , particularly our tourism and transport sectors . #% The Commission is best placed to set out these rules . #% The primary objective of the Cotonou Agreement is the reduction and , eventually , the eradication of poverty in a way consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy . #% Why is it that those of us with questions one , two and three in part three will not receive oral answers ? #% The cost of disposal of this waste would drain the resources of our local authorities in terms of landfill sites , transport and manpower , and there is also the loss to the economy of the valuable materials which were dumped . #% While protesting peacefully against the erection of a high-tension electricity pylon right beside the orphanage , he was most viciously attacked by the police , arrested , denied medical attention and subsequently had great difficulty in obtaining medical treatment , as no doctor in the city was prepared to help him . #% From the outset I would stress that economic and social cohesion is an enshrined principle now and for the future . #% Any agreement on concentration must include a firm commitment to proper transitional arrangements . #% As far as energy from renewable energy sources is concerned , every foresight programme undertaken , including that in the UK , has identified this sector as being of tremendous importance , including wind energy , photovoltaic energy and , of course , biomass . #% The success of the European project rests on tolerance of diversity and difference and , if necessary , agreeing to disagree . #% Concerted action can have a positive effect , provided it is not founded on the values of the lowest common denominator nor on any retreat from the 1951 Geneva Convention 's fundamental approach to asylum-seeking as an individual human right . #% I wish during this debate to take the opportunity of addressing economic growth , in particular in my own country of Ireland . #% The attention that we must pay to buildings but are not yet paying is a crucial aspect of these reports and I recommend the practical effects of those to all of us . #% Would it now be prudent to establish a central European register for suicide cases so that an EU-wide analysis of data could take place ? #% As a politician , democratically accountable to my electorate , I am also not prepared to delegate my responsibility to unelected , unaccountable bodies . #% Accounts can , of course , be harmonised , but harmonised accounts can then be adjusted for tax purposes in Member States and that is an issue for Member States . #% This funding for population and reproductive health care will be accessed to provide abortion in developing countries , according to the upcoming Sandbæk report . #% There must be proportionality . #% On behalf of my group , I fully support the provisions of paragraphs 54 and 55 of the motion for resolution which call for a ban on human cloning , regardless of the technique used , and on other activities which are intended to result in the modification of the human gene line . #% In spite of initiatives taken by the Commission to strengthen its dialogue with the industry , I believe that these should be fully reinforced . #% This is primarily the case because the dynamics within the European institutions are going to change . #% Also the issue of costs for education and training should be factored in , because obviously this is a cost , or should be a cost , in most cases to employers . #% The proposed directive on improving the quality of shipping fuels is important as it will bring the quality of shipping fuels into line with on-land motor fuels . #% I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Kenyan authorities , and in particular President Moi , for any assistance they can provide to ensure a positive outcome . #% At present , the EU livestock sector is experiencing difficulties caused by a range of factors , including rising production costs , competition from imports from third countries , and , of course , various issues which

The Commission should draw up an accession partnership and provide for a programme of financial assistance for the pre-accession period to help the Maltese authorities to bridge the economic gap that remains between Malta and the European Union . #% The Arab League has finally pledged some economic support and EU Member States also need to be generous in this regard . #% Yes , we have concerns about a few individuals but the responsibility for ensuring that none of them hit the headlines adversely over the next five years is yours , not ours , given the limited scope of the hearings in this Parliament . #% I regret that there has been no consideration of establishing a new programme to combat social exclusion and actions on behalf of the elderly . #% While registration should generally be on a first-come , first-served principle , we have nonetheless proposed that rightholders , who have prior rights in law and public policy , should have the opportunity to pre-register . #% We must not become emotional about this issue . #% Hardest hit at the moment is the airline industry but we must not forget the tourist industry which has already suffered greatly this year from foot-and-mouth disease . #% In providing and caring for the elderly , that will mean utilising new technologies and new methods of ensuring that they have independent means of living and can fully participate in their own community . #% We are not keeping them and we will not unless we change direction . #% We are second worst in terms of transposition and designation of sites under the habitats directive . #% A delegation of MEPs from various groups recently visited the Guantánamo Bay detention centre . #% It was very questionably driven by design criteria and not performance criteria . #% European electricity and gas networks constitute key pieces of strategic infrastructure . #% It is very clear to me that the Northern Ireland Agreement has to be accepted in its entirety ; there is no question of cherrypicking . #% The challenge for Ireland and Europe will be to implement the agreed guidelines via the national reform programmes . #% I wish to refer briefly to Sellafield . #% When they have a complaint to make , they will reach for the nearest known vehicle available to them . #% When I returned from Parliament I found my neighbours - I shall declare an interest , I live in that part of the city - were bobbing around in boats , carrying their pets . #% I believe that national Member States should retain the right of veto on taxation matters . #% The only country that has been ` wronged ' are the Irish fishermen who have been denied their natural share and who were never allowed to exploit the seas . #% President-in-Office , I would like to join Mr McCartin in extending a very warm welcome to you . #% Mr President , my predecessor , Mr Philip Whitehead MEP , would have been proud to have spoken on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection . #% A different product or therapy incorporating or using knowledge of the same gene sequence should be covered by an entirely separate patent and there should be no derivative patenting .

' #% What I would like to ask the President-in-Office is , accepting that high priority has been placed on this issue in the Council in the past , why is it that we are still facing this problem ? #% Following on from Mr Macartney 's point , in Killybegs in the north-west of Ireland when people complain about the common fisheries policy - and I try to defend the Community - I am told the Norwegians are surviving all right . #% The skills and the experience of the workforce and the major capital investment could and should be redirected towards waste management and the creation of a centre of excellence for decommissioning and that is what I suggest we concentrate the debate on . #% in writing . - I was in favour of the recommendation to the Council on the 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly , which calls for strengthened EU visibility at the United Nations . #% As an aside , I venture to suggest that this is the secret ambition of some of the supporters of early enlargement . #% You have talked also about factoring in both the national dimension and the wider public debate . #% How can the Member States , including Ireland , contribute more to the fight against all forms of violence against children ? #% Scientific testing must be specific , in this case for children , and must be updated . #% But clearly there were , in Göteborg , anarchic groups whose essential , primary purpose was to undermine democracy itself . #% This charter of passenger rights currently exists in European Union airports but many passengers are not fully aware of its existence or do not fully understand its provisions . #% This was unfortunate , not because it was not necessary , but because we should not the EU find ourselves in such a position that simply feeds euro-scepticism in Europe , particularly in the country which is so reprimanded . #% In the past that would have shown a constant increase in nuclear power . #% A combination of conservation and good management on the one hand , and increasing fish farming on the other , will go some way to securing that future . #% His draft resolution recognizes that agricultural compensation will need to be put into place so that all sectors of society can benefit from the EMU regime . #% It is simply not realistic to ask the Commission to monitor every individual payment to final beneficiaries . #% Out of a total of 26 offences in my own country , Ireland , 20 were dealt with by the criminal courts . #% Despite all the honeyed words we may spout here , the reality of who is best able to deliver on those strategies -- who is best able to give those skills to young workers , students or older people who want to retrain or re-skill -- is that it is not the European Union , but each Member State . #% I do not think we can believe that . #%

#% I am pleased that our socialist amendment calling for a parliamentary assembly was taken up world-wide . #% The PSE voting list tomorrow will reflect our desire not only to see the opening-up of a consumer credit market in this area but also to achieve the highest possible level of consumer protection for consumers right across Europe . #% The first opportunity is to create a partnership for cooperation and the management of the increased trading activities . #% This is a relatively new area for EU legislation . #% In fact , I would congratulate her on her very balanced presentation this evening . #% The review should be by an independent body and not by those who have vested interests in the continuation of fishing by the EU . #% Think of the purchasing power which those billions could release to our economy . #% I hope that the Council of Ministers is intending to act rationally . #% That makes us feel good but does not actually change anything . #% Well , we all know what we need to do with a time bomb : we need to defuse it . #% The report is timely and Mr Maaten 's observations are very welcome . #% In recent weeks a number of positive indicators have suggested an increased willingness on the part of Member States to agree a workable compromise . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur who used her experience in the fifth framework programme and her professional experience as a scientist to the great benefit of all of us , particularly following her accident . #% Difference is the essence of humanity , and it should therefore be totally respected and never fought over . #% This is a challenge that the EU must rise to . #% I welcome therefore the fact that language requirements are included for the certification of third country seafarers . #% It is spread most unfairly : EUR 17 000 per farmer to French farmers , EUR 3 000 per farmer to Portuguese and Greek farmers . #% I also welcome the presentation on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which took a balanced approach to the major and indeed legitimate concerns of the Committee on Budgetary Control about fraud . #% I call on Member States to review their national legislation to promote parity and genuine democracy in politics , review their constitution , legislation and practice , enshrine gender equality as a fundamental principle in their constitutions and take measures aiming at the reconciliation of social , family and professional life , in line with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council and the Lisbon Strategy , thereby creating an enabling environment for women 's full participation in politics . #% The future is bright , and the single European currency will bring with it an increased number of tourists , which will mean an increased number of jobs in Irish tourism and a healthy industry into the next century . #% It is very difficult for the local community . #% Mr President , I would appreciate it if your bench would occasionally look in this direction . #% Can you offer any advice in this situation ? #% Most important of all , are we to see nothing but white elephants as our contribution to the Middle East peace process ? #% With regard to the regulation on addition of vitamins and minerals and the so-called ` certain other substances ' to food , I feel very strongly that mass medication of the population at large , through the addition of substances to publicly supplied basic necessities such as drinking water , is ethically questionable and should not be permitted , particularly if it can not be scientifically proven that the health of sensitive groups within the population is not adversely affected by such an addition . #% In July I called for a crusade for children ; now more than ever such a crusade is imperative . #% It is now urgent that we cease reprocessing and that the high-level waste tanks be shifted to passive containment such as vitrification . #% How do you win an election ?

The European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions , based in Dublin , published a study in May showing that there is no guarantee of equal treatment for agency workers in Ireland and that there is virtually no legal protection for agency workers at all in Ireland . #% Many of them are run-away children , sometimes running away with adults , not their parents . #% What short-term targets or actions and indicators will be needed to ensure its full development ? #% Mr President , very briefly I want to thank the Commissioner and congratulate him on the progress he is making in the particular area of poverty reduction . #% Madam President , the debate is very much centred on the notion of Europe being a continent . #% We were not all that good , but we were very lucky . #% So , while the Portuguese Government has no monopoly on truth , it has competence , which it considers was threatened . #% Commissioner , you have stated on a number of occasions that you have a preference for administrative sanctions as against criminal sanctions . #% As an example , the IRA was almost defeated on a number of occasions , but wrong decisions were made and it won public sympathy and grew again . #% I hope that interest rates will be harmonized as time goes on . #% The tourism industry in Europe was extremely hard hit in the past year following 11 September . #% There is nowhere in the whole of European Union where renewable energy is not relevant , whether it is Lapland or the Islands of Greece . #% I know that no legislation is perfect . #% That seems to me to be a contradiction in terms . #% Many of my colleagues have spoken about the blame game and who is more to blame , because President Barroso did not say this or a government did not say that . #% Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the British presidency for their participation in the peace process in Ireland . #% We have a very good line-up of hard working Commissioners tonight . #% In addition , questions about the distortion of the market , particularly in regard to plant construction , have been raised . #% Madam President , I , like the other speakers , would congratulate the rapporteur and also the Commission for bringing forward this whole debate at the moment because we are at a vital juncture within the development of the European economy . #% The Council shows every sign of sticking to its old tradition of watering down these proposals so that the improvements in fishing will be even less than is hoped for . #% That said , it is extremely unsatisfactory for us , as legislators to have been asked to rush through such a technical piece of legislation . #% One must of course have a level playing field as regards state aids and other similar areas , and we do have this . #% However , we are back to where we are because of the statement from the Commission today and also because of the underhand moves taking place in certain capitals around Europe to try to prevent or slow down the accession of Bulgaria and Romania . #% The resolution is also right to point out that , in trying to restore public order , it is vitally important that human rights are not violated . #% I strongly believe that the EU must continue to play as active a role as possible in brokering a peace between both sides . #% A common minimum standard of security is needed not only because of the real threat of aviation crime , but also for the perceived threat that a lack of security shows the public . #% UN sanctions are applied with a ferocity that tears apart the fragile consensus of the region . #% The European Commission has also presented a legislative proposal on child pornography on the Internet , in line with the provisions of the Council 's European cyber-crime convention . #% This would be a recipe for international speculators to come in and play one currency off against another . #% In the field of defence , regardless of what common policy elements are adopted , I believe that Member States will continue to play different roles . #% Young male drivers , for example , face insurance costs at least twice as high as in other European countries , and that is on top of the higher car prices in Ireland anyway . #% It is a completely separate issue and it is unacceptable . #% In order to secure an EU type approval for light commercial vehicles , the Directive will include a requirement that in the future vehicles be tested for carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption . #% And when do we amend legislation in this Parliament ? #% These are very important issues for the continuing development and growth of the European Union . #% One of the key negotiating chapters remaining open relates to agriculture . #% That is why the nuclear industry has to be more careful than other industries . #% However , the conditions and events which surrounded the recent World Summit on the Information Society have significantly increased existing concerns relating to human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia . #% All political leaders in both governments , but especially those in Northern Ireland itself , bear a heavy responsibility . #% I wish you success , as I am sure that the future of this new constitution depends on this happening . #% As Parliament 's rapporteur on Malta 's accession , I am delighted that Malta was there yesterday at the European Conference and that such a welcome was given to its renewed application for membership of the European Union . #% Mr President , in relation to the Böge report I speak on behalf of my colleagues in the Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group : Mrs Doyle , Mr Mitchell , Mr Coveney and Mr Higgins . #% Due to the ever-changing nature of this field , we need to re-evaluate the regulations protecting our citizens . #% A most recently updated programme adopted last December was framed against a prospect of strong but moderate economic growth and in the medium to long-term the Government intends to continue to run significant budgetary surpluses reflecting economic good sense and our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact . #% When we deal with legislation which intimately affects human health we must exercise great care and attention . #% If you think about the tragic history of the whole Balkans region , one of the aspects that had been missing for so long was this idea of justice . #% Fish is caught to be sold on the market and therefore there is great scope , via the markets , to improve the efficiency of the CFP as well as promoting its conservation goals . #% I want to make it very clear from the outset that I , my delegation , and those I represent are totally in favour of improvement to the highest possible standards . #% Politically , we have the full support of our Conference of Presidents , which decided on two different occasions - most recently earlier this month - that in all dossiers negotiators should insist on the application of the delegated acts procedure for decisions concerning objectives , the choice of priorities , expected results and financial allocations in broad terms . #% I understand that Total has recently done a deal with the Myanmar Oil and Gas Exploration Company . #% in writing . - Tax fraud and tax evasion result in an estimated EUR 200 billion being lost each year - money stolen from taxpayers in the rich world and the neediest in the developing world . #% We have too many flags as far as I am concerned . #% As a zone dedicated to stability we can exert a major positive influence on the global stage especially at this time of crisis . #% But we all agree that transport is the key energy problem : fossil fuels must be replaced by alternatives , and very soon . #% I will take a slightly different perspective . #% This drift in policy terms has to stop . #% There is an urgent need for a reply to the Irish Government 's request to the Commission for permission to assist the Irish airline with the compensation that is due as a result of 11 September . #% There has been considerable criticism of lobbies . #% So Parliament is entitled to ask if this is actually a Council position or the position of one Member State . #% However , we have to accept that there is absolutely no chance of influencing the United States when we are so dependent on them . #% The night before we had the Maastricht Referendum , they upped their tone and the temperature of their anti-European broadcasting , which goes on continuously , in an effort to ingratiate themselves with fishing communities who have the impression that somehow or another the European Commission is there to damage their interests . #% We have had the dioxin scare , BSE and many other problems . #% Unfortunately the preferential tariff arrangements enable goods to be imported into the EU from under-developed nations , either duty-free or at a reduced rate . #% Mr President , I also want to address a rigid Commission policy . #% She says : ` How can you expect me to condemn human rights abuses in Algeria , China and elsewhere when the United Nations themselves are responsible for the situation in Iraq ? ' #% This harmonisation of taxes is directly opposed to the wishes of the Irish people . #% 
Nevertheless , production controls ensure that many farmers can not increase their income from farming and , therefore , alternative income-generating opportunities from off-farm activities are vital if rural populations are to benefit from economic growth . #% We must show that we are earnest in calling for the repeal of those most foul actions and that we are against the denial of the most basic human right - the right to life . #% Extensive production of greenhouse gases is resulting in the depletion of the ozone layer which , in turn , is resulting in higher sea levels , contributing to greater coastal erosion , greater flooding and the elimination of many of our island communities . #% We were then told agriculture would be safe in the WTO . #% We are all aware of why these species are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation , as Mr Stevenson pointed out in his introduction . #% It is the first country in its region to sign an association agreement with the EU . #% Finally , I want to congratulate Mr Howitt on doing an excellent job this year under new and different circumstances . #% I therefore support the declaration of ingredients on all food items . #% That is what I support . #% The current ` integrated approach ' to financing environmental policy being proposed by the Commission , whereby funding will come from rural development funding and structural funds , worries me deeply and I think it simply will not work . #% Servicing debt costs the poorest countries more than they receive in development aid . #% Two points struck me immediately in the speeches and comments I heard earlier on . #% So vicious was this attack that Merseyside police called for an urgent press conference . #% It is a fact that uncontrolled arms exports undermine global security . #% Like many other huge vessels - in fact it is worse than other vessels because it is one of the largest there is - it goes to developing countries , acting as if it had some right to exploit the resources of other countries without any checks . #% There is no justification for this war in my opinion or in the opinion of the protestors . #% But it is right that we should . #% Interestingly enough , not one person has been arrested in connection with those 40 deaths ; not one person has been convicted in connection with those 40 deaths . #% If we are going to shut down sugar production in Ireland and in the EU , we can and must properly compensate the farmers and producers , even if just to salve our own conscience . #% The first part was supposed to last 30 minutes , according to the Agenda ; but it lasted much longer . #% This is particularly the case with China , and we have named a whole series of people involved . #% While such policies are relevant to all rural women , I want to specifically refer to the often forgotten role of women in agriculture . #% I thank the President-in-Office for her positive response and for outlining the present position with regard to my question . #% We have been asked to trust Member States . #% As you know , the Commission published a White Paper on the issue , recommending that a framework directive be put in place to cover services of general interest . #% Mr President , as usual , very sincerely meant congratulations to the three rapporteurs involved in this package . #% For example , the Commission study indicates a 3 % fall in EU beef production , but a 12 % fall in Irish beef production . #% I hope that the Commissioner will undertake a review of the timescale for preparing legislation to prevent problems of this sort , which I am sure are as disappointing to her as they are to us . #% Firstly , when did it become a sin to be radical ; when was it ordained that we should not try to create something new and different and , when we see mistakes , not try to right them ? #% The last 12 months has seen so many tragedies and natural disasters that have hit parts of the world : tsunamis , drought , mudslides , floods , repeated hurricanes , typhoons and now an earthquake . #% Is this the Pauline Green who , in December , recommended that we vote confidence without even thinking ? #% I , too , want to wish him well in the work he is going to do for us in the European Union over the next six months . #% Decentralised management is most welcome as we all wish to see a less cumbersome and bureaucratic approach to the running of European programmes and drawing down of funds . #% First , can we have an assurance that when there is any further disruption to the single market , the Commission will act urgently and swiftly to ensure that Member States discharge their obligations to ensure that the single market is not disrupted . #% My last point is that we need to continue investing in people , because no matter how many figures and statistics are put before us the bottom line is that we are talking about one single individual person who has lost out on an opportunity within the European Union . #% It is quite clear that it should be explicit and if it is already implied then I do not see what the problem is about ensuring that it is explicit because as time goes by radioactive substances are going to pose an even greater danger and - as I have already said - we are very lucky that there has not already been a serious accident . #% It is clear that there are serious distortions in the energy market with many hidden subsidies to both coal and oil generated energy . #% These programmes are funded by both government and industry . #% Air travel in particular has become cheaper and more convenient for everyone . #% This , as I have said on numerous occasions , is something that has never been , is not and never will be acceptable to those of us who are committed to defending farmers with small - and medium-sized farms and our rural communities . #% The President-in-Office has heard that from the Members here this afternoon . #% Last July , before the present tragedy came to light I urged Parliament in Strasbourg to hold a full and open discussion on violence against children in the autumn . #% It is also extremely worrying that the decision on whether or not a party will share in EU funding will be taken by an institution of the European Union . #% Thank you , Mr-President-in-Office , for that very full answer . #% Some progress has been made and no doubt the conclusion of the conciliation has helped them in that regard . #% If the economies of Eastern and Central Europe are not competitive , then they will not be able to participate within the internal market in any real , effective sense . #% For example , Ireland has one of the fairest electoral systems in the whole of the European Community . #% All countries involved in fishing the relevant stocks , be they coastal states or distant water states , should be involved in assessments of stocks and negotiations over how much fishing is done and who has the right to do it . #% The fact that the FAO estimates that , on a global basis , one tonne of fish is thrown away for every three tonnes that is kept shows that this is a very serious problem . #% If you want to encourage citizens to support change and reform , you have to explain to them what is in it for them , for their own life prospects . #% Similarly , enlargement will also generate additional road transport . #% Every day on the Internet , cross-border sales and business are alive and thriving , using the principle of mutual recognition . #% We must provide more medical help for these victims . #% Madam President , I will be supporting the new Commission tomorrow at the vote in the European Parliament , but my heart is heavy . #% There is a tendency in the report to assume that issues concerning health care of the elderly apply to the health system as a whole . #% This must be made public knowledge and not hidden behind a shroud of ` trade secrecy ' . #% They may want to work , or choose to , and even if they do not , they may need to earn because mortgages must be paid and food must be put on the table . #% An entity that can not raise taxes autonomously , is not authorised to run budget deficits , has no right to raise a military force and , most importantly , can not act outside the competences given to it by the Member States is not a recipe for a super-state by any stretch of the imagination . #% Despite some populist measures against poverty when he was in government , Mr Thaksin represents the capitalist elite and deceives the masses . #% in writing . - More investment in research and innovation is essential to guarantee a sustainable and competitive future for our economies . #% The Sudan situation will be debated and a draft resolution considered . #% I call on the Americans and on the Texas authorities to commute her sentence and to put a stay on her execution . #% I believe , as does my constituent , that a revamp of the website is needed , with , where possible , real-life cases that have been solved by SOLVIT . #% From now on every link in the food chain will become an integral part of the production process . #% Any reading of the record will show that the strength of my reply here today indicates that we are at one with Parliament . #% They need encouragement and those firms need help . #% 
Who are the United States to decide , for political reasons , that a democratically-elected Member of this Parliament is not allowed to enter ? #% I do not know British law that well , but I suspect that if this case was in Ireland the complainants could force you to produce the information . #% First , the link between hunger and climate change . #% We will certainly see a rise in Islamic fundamentalism and individual attacks on Western targets will continue unabated , even on a freelance basis , should this war take place . #% This directive will go some way to linking cooperation and exchanges of information , as well as extending the scope and range of the offences . #% In my own constituency , Crumlin United Football Club -- a club for young people , where Robbie Keane came from -- each year holds a sports festival weekend where people not only play sport but also have cultural exchanges . #% For that reason , the Internet is a real headache for totalitarian dictators and governments , who go to great lengths to restrict and prevent its free use . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for that information . #% I note what he says about the intensive bilateral negotiations currently taking place between Germany and the UK and , indeed , I believe France over emissions . #% Parliament could play its role as watchdog much more effectively and ensure that the money is spent on the core objectives of the Union 's development cooperation defined in the Treaty : the reduction - and ultimately the eradication - of poverty . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner if she thinks it might be useful for us to have a cohesion audit on an annual basis and try to build that into the Commission 's work programme . #% It is a tangible way of bringing Europe closer to the citizens and I would support the view that this card should , in fact , have a European logo and should be very clearly identified as a European benefit for citizens . #% Identification of animals , issues of transport , insurance and many other matters came up apart from the vaccination issue . #% It is a signal of the importance that the Commission attaches to this issue . #% The Council is wrong in trying to say this is the Commission 's responsibility . #% Policy Coherence for Development can not be sidelined when negotiating bilateral and regional trade agreements , and has a key role to play if we are to ensure that the outcome of the Doha Round is not detrimental to development . #% There has been too much focus on agriculture , which you have said yourself , Commissioner . #% However , I would just like to remind colleagues that they can smoke in comfort and away from everybody else in the designated area over there to the right at the window . #% At that time , the child can understand that the mother , or the substitute primary care-giver , will come back and is not gone forever . #% But the Community is a big place and Ireland is an island and far away from its main markets . #% While these measures were not popular before the eruption last week , we are currently at the point where any missed opportunity to provide assistance to the aviation industry could prove to be fatal . #% There are other measures that can help compensate sectors generally in terms of our budget . #% In the Member States there already exist the most stringent systems of checking on animals for transport , particularly those on long-haul journeys , and rightly so . #% There are a number of models of worker participation . #% Figures show that visitor growth is concentrated mainly on the east coast of Ireland around the capital , Dublin . #% Mr President , may I add my congratulations to the rapporteur for a very welcome report . #% Yes , the rest of the family are delighted - a quick `` Hi Mum '' , - a head goes up and you might get a hug and then back to the TV or whatever they were doing - but 20 minutes later the dogs are still running round in high excitement . #% You have our support , Mr Barroso . #% I want though to reject the criticisms of the Socialist Group made by Jim Nicholson yesterday and again today . #% On behalf of my Group , which also welcomes this renewed request for accession , I wish to say that we also welcome the Maltese Government 's decision and indeed the opinion , shared by the opposition , that there will be a referendum held on the conclusion of the negotiations . #% I know that Members in my own group asked questions such as : will this person get this Commission post ? #% Two weeks ago , a poultry-processing plant in Northern Ireland closed with the loss of over 400 jobs , not to mention the other jobs on the farms and in the feed compound mills . #% Therefore , a very comprehensive aid and development programme is required to meet the long-term needs of the country and its people . #% My group regrets that , 15 months after the signature of Amsterdam , the Council has not integrated Schengen into the acquis . #% This convention aims to provide legal recognition for domestic work as work , to extend rights to all domestic workers , and to prevent violations and abuses . #% I would like the services and , indeed , Parliament to look at this because environmental certification of all projects is not possible , is not in line with the regulations and contravenes the memorandum of understanding between Parliament and the Commission as well as being , of course , against the principle of subsidiarity . #% The country is in crisis : there are a huge number people that are food dependent ; law and order has broken down ; people in Iraq are saying that now that they come out on the streets people are dead ; the whole structure has broken down . #% Undoubtedly , the European Council , representing the fifteen governments , will have to reform its structures . #% I welcome the fact that the revised directive excludes the following issues from patentability : processes of cloning human beings , processes for modifying the genome line genetic identity of human beings and use of human embryos for industrial and commercial purposes . #% Of course we must have protections in place to ensure that those who are guilty of wrongdoing , fraud , racketeering and of interfering with Community assets and finances should be excluded from public contracts . #% The incomplete market has created nearly EUR 1 000 billion of prosperity and 2.5 million additional jobs in Europe . #% The EUR 308 billion for 2007-2013 will go largely to the new Member States . #% With regard to funding for health , I have welcomed the modifications here and would thank Mr Caudron for his concern , because human genome research can not be the only strand of health research funded by the EU . #% We have in our midst enough innovation , ingenuity and compromise to bring forward positive , new initiatives to ensure that all the peoples within Europe can benefit from what we are trying to create here today . #% If you read the name to the House , then I trust and hope that the people who are accusing me of voting twice will apologize and withdraw . #% Thus this is a directive which I can not , and will not , support . #% The reactivation of the Ferries Directive , whereby ferry workers would have the same working conditions irrespective of their nationality , would be a step in the right direction . #% I come from Ireland where a recently published report by the Cork University Hospital - one of the two centres designated for treating victims of nuclear and chemical accidents - stated that there are no facilities presently available to enable it to fulfil this role . #% That is in an effort to ensure that nobody would interpret recital C as justifying the setting-up of radical Islamic courts with a view to restoring order . #% The third and most important principle is what I call the healing process . #% I also want to thank Mr Bourlanges , who laid out the strategy for this report . #% I call not just for the Games but for the tourism spin-off to be managed and organised in such a way that every region of the UK will benefit . #% This should help to ensure that both programmes are more focused and that each gets the level of visibility and funding it deserves . #% I would urge you to impress on the Commission and the Council that Israel must be persuaded to end its veto on the development of the Gaza Strip . #% Is that alright with Europe ? #% I appeal to the President-in-Office and to the incoming President-in-Office to reassure the House that whatever new initiatives are necessary will be undertaken . #% Waste oil is considered hazardous in the United Kingdom , whereas in the Republic of Ireland it is not . #% It is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this . #% The fact that 500 , 000 women are estimated to be being trafficked in the European Community is an appalling figure . #% What have we learned from the recent scares such as foot-and-mouth and BSE ? #% In the meantime , around the world , the smaller , inefficient sectors will gradually be snuffed out . #% That is a particular problem in Ireland . #% But we should not offer the prospect of young , energetic people in greater numbers producing the quantity of food that Europe needs today because they will not eat it . #% Has it considered tabling any amendments or made proposals to do so to the Euratom Treaty to allow for peer review from another Member State for a neighbouring nuclear power station ? #% I think this directive is well over due . #% However , we do expect that rollout to be completed in 2007 , although the cervical cancer screening programme wo n't be completed until 2008 at the earliest - some 15 years later ! #% 
The intention was to amend the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feedingstuff to be indicated with a declaration of percentage by weight . #% If that is not forthcoming , then we should act on our own . #% Many of the letters I receive in Dublin are from members of religious orders , for example . #% We demand that the EU as a whole makes its concerns known to the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and call for an end to the current abuse of human rights . #% But it had become increasingly obvious , particularly since the Nice European Summit in 2000 , that the old intergovernmental method of revising European Treaties did not enable adequate European responses to the common challenges facing us to emerge , nor did it enable citizens to feel that the process belonged to them . #% Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception , and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at . #% Scientists have claimed that water temperatures in the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico have been as much as 3.6 degrees higher than normal this year . #% Finally , I wish to say to the Commission that I understand what it is trying to do but , until the beef market has time to recover from the recent crisis , it is absolutely necessary to ease the very severe proposals so that farmers can stay in business . #% We must remember , we have a duty and a responsibility to the Community fishermen and we must ensure that their rights are protected . #% Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative . #% Add to this the fact that 50 % of AIDS patients in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV/AIDS is rife will develop TB , and we can see how lucky we are to be in the relatively controlled immunised area , having programmes such as we do . #% Maybe as a last act you might do it before you leave that chair . #% Nor can it rewrite it or change e-Commerce law , in particular the responsibility of ISPs as defined in Articles 12 to 15 of the e-Commerce directive . #% Mr President , I would like to restrict my remarks to Mr Wuermeling 's report on consumer credit . #% Society usually accepts a certain level of risk in return for an advantage and proponents of nuclear energy almost inevitably remind us of the balance of risk and benefit . #% This way they can give assistance rather than having to transport people over long distances . #% There are shared-city initiatives to promote community ; there is development and training for unemployed women - I am just singling out some of the very successful operations that are going on - the development of the food industry and , of course , the new housing development . #% Undoubtedly Europe has the resources to sustain our high living standards , but we need to take action to unlock them . #% We should condemn these sort of acts outside the European Union as well as inside . #% If we truly believe in job creation , and I know in this House there is a great commitment to that as a policy objective , public service protectionism , as distinct from a public service ethic , must play no part in our policy package . #% This figure , however , masks the higher energy import dependency of peripheral and geographically isolated energy markets such as the Baltics , Ireland and other island communities . #% The fact that there are so many diverse views and divisions amongst scientists must surely bring home to us legislators that this is not a clear-cut issue . #% Regrettably , our consumer society is contributing to an increasing volume of domestic waste and there is also growing concern in relation to industrial waste . #% For instance , the EU-funded integrated coastal zone management projects such as the Atlantic Living Coastline in the UK and others have since ceased . #% If the world 's poor need food to eat and clean water to drink -- and we know they do -- then Doha was never going to deliver that to them . #% in writing . - It is important that Europe reaffirms its commitment to , and cooperation with , international movements like the UN at this time . #% Mr President , is this the European Union or do some have expansionist ambitions beyond the boundaries of Europe ? #% Liberalisation of gas and electricity is certainly part of the Lisbon Process , but this does not mean a free-for-all in the electricity and gas markets . #% I am glad to support the motion and commend it to the House . #% Each country has its own menu of special cases , be they young farmers , disease issues , early farm retirement issues , successor rights and those who invested heavily in the reference years . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to pay tribute to all who served on the recent EU election observation mission to Pakistan , particularly the members of my core team and also the European Parliament delegation led by Miss Grönfeldt Bergman . #% Therefore I will be supporting Amendment No 15 as well as Amendment No 9 . #% If this is not done , and done very soon , then the crisis in the sector can only escalate . #% Equally , and for the same reasons of ensuring impartiality , public media operators should be independent and not subject to interference by governmental authorities . #% Mr McCreevy has of course always opposed that model . #% We have done that this year but we can not continue to do it for ever . #% I would also urge more tolerance in relation to religious freedom . #% I must say that it is somewhat disappointing that some of the amendments to this report are seeking to look for exemptions for areas under Article 92 ( 3 ) ( a ) in my view seeking to secure Objective 1 status by the back door . #% Finally , can I say to Mrs Fraga Estévez and to you , Mr President , there is great joy in Belfast tonight : we beat the Spanish football team 3-2 . #% I am happy about the inclusion of my amendment on the necessity to ensure consultation , cooperation and , where appropriate , compensation for farmers when their activities are restricted owing to the enhancement of landscapes and habitats . #% In my personal experience in Ireland , I never heard the European Commission take Ireland to task for failure in the area of additionality . #% We can not demand in this institution , of other institutions , what we would not demand of ourselves . #% I do this also at a time when a renegotiation process of the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement gets under way this week in Britain , sponsored by the Irish and British Governments , which involves all of the parties there in an attempt to get this process back on its feet . #% Secondly , the election procedure whereby members are elected by an absolute majority is not ideal . #% I agree that the Commission paper of last spring is insufficient , particularly in relation to short-term aid . #% Despite warning letters , reasoned opinions , threats of legal action to the European Court of Justice , so it embarrassingly continues . #% Concerns still exist but I believe that Council , Commission and Parliament have struck the right balance between the need to protect public policy and consumers and at the same time promote and support the growth of e-business . #% Will he indicate where he stands on duty-free and will he argue for its retention at Commission level ? #% Do we need legislation ? #% I should like to say that this report addresses many current concerns in the fisheries sector and certainly rebuilding the stocks of cod and hake is going to be a tremendous challenge . #% Israel 's initial response to the reconciliation , withholding Palestinian Authority ( P.A. ) taxes , is illegal and potentially catastrophic for peace , putting at risk the state-building efforts of Prime Minister Salem Fayyad . #% We are imposing new restrictions which we do not have the power to do under the Treaty . #% For example , our waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms , drugs and human beings . #% We have suffered enough for far too long and we want a better life for everyone . #% Nonetheless , given the large uncertainties and the major risks involved , the provision for force majeure must be retained . #% Of course , everybody likes to say we must help the young farmers . #% Any proposal that she would put before this House would have my full support and confidence because I trust entirely her integrity in these matters . #% Healthcare migration is certainly to our benefit , but as lives are saved in developed countries , they are lost in less developed countries . #% I abstained on the vote because no mention or condemnation was made of the recent attempt of the French Parliament to brand and outlaw certain Bible Protestants in France as sectarian . #% I welcome this report and I look forward to the discussion that will follow and the eventual policy we can redesign around those proposals . #% If we can not get the Member States to support that , I would ask that we allow the regions and local authorities which wish to participate to come directly to the Commissioner in Brussels and get actively involved in those pacts . #% I would also plead for input from those who have to implement this labelling to make sure that it is clear and transparent , that it is of good design and can easily be seen and understood . #% Therefore it is vital that the rural development regulation aids , rather than aggravates , our situation . #% For my part I have always believed that you acted in those controversies without fear or favour . #% Part and parcel of such an approach will be the further development of sectoral policies including those for agriculture , the environment , health , family planning and education . #% Despite all the denials , this Constitution is a framework for superstatehood . #% 
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the presidency and the European heads of State and government for their support and positive contribution to the process of revisiting the Treaty of Nice by Ireland . #% Indeed , I am delighted to hear that he sees Europol 's role as being central to the development of the fight against organised crime on a pan-European level . #% By all means let us protect and encourage those who want to produce speciality foods , but let us also recognise that EU agriculture produces high-specification commodities which are also in need of protection . #% It is impossible to get accurate statistics for the number of children who are missing in the European Union . #% It is essential that in the IGC discussions there are movements towards giving us a Treaty competence for renewable energy alongside that which we have , somewhat anachronistically , for nuclear power through the Euratom Treaty . #% It is a very finely balanced question which is a very genuine one and a very important one . #% Abuse is under-reported . #% For Europe to be at the forefront of a successful knowledge-based economy , we must move forward with new technologies and stay ahead in the knowledge race . #% Mr President , as an aside , I should like to inform you that the Irish have just won the first race at the Cheltenham festival . #% Mr President , the forthcoming Stockholm Summit will address many of the European Union 's key social and employment problems . #% My substantive question is : I would like to know - in the present crisis and on a temporary basis - would you be prepared with regard to intervention , to consider raising carcass weights and price ? #% At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela , changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna . #% My understanding is that it is the committee that gave the all-clear which is the committee on which we are relying . #% I hope that this IGC deals with the structural deficiencies , that we end unanimity and replace it with QMV , that we strengthen the relationship with the Commission and the Parliament in this whole area and move away from intergovernmentalism and that we promise to start a real debate on the framing of a defence policy , hopefully incorporating the WEU and the EU pillar . #% We know that concentration is the name of the game now in both the Community competition policy and indeed in structural fund assistance . #% In the face of government cuts , the EU is providing vital funds for the UK regions . #% However , once this had been resolved , the EU formally invited eight countries from Central and Eastern Europe , plus Cyprus and Malta , to join in 2004 . #% It is hiding , for trade reasons , behind the governments in China , Russia , India and Malaysia , which said that they would protect the Sudanese Government and veto sanctions against it . #% It has come about to achieve this technical agreement . #% I am happy with the report 's cautionary aspect . #% The Commissioner is living very dangerously and some would say recklessly in the timing of his proposals . #% Bioethanol is one of these sources . #% I want the title to make it clear that it is the G7 proposal for the completion of the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors in Ukraine . #% Services of general economic interest are essential for improving the quality of life for all citizens , and these services are often central in helping to attract investment to less-favoured areas and rural areas , thus boosting their competitiveness and leading to greater cohesion within the EU . #% There are two reasons why flooding is becoming such a problem . #% We should be very concerned that only half of cases are estimated to have been diagnosed . #% So coastguard cooperation might be very loose or it could be something more structured . #% We need to tighten up the law and ensure that examination practised does not permit the patenting of software or business methods . #% For example , the addition of fluoride to drinking water has a disproportionately negative effect on bottle-fed babies and young children , as their reconstituted milk formula made from that public drinking water equates to their total diet . #% You have won the respect of this Parliament during the period of time that you served as Vice-President and the many roles that you had to fulfil . #% The focus is on solving the problem of foam caused by surfactants in our water systems . #% This issue is about implementation or delegated acts . #% It all boils down to the fact that other than putting forward a draft resolution at the 55th human rights meeting in Geneva , where we stated our position , we have done nothing else since because we have no information whatsoever with regard to the 598 Kuwaiti men and seven women who were sent to Iraqi prisons . #% We propose that the hearings should be tough because we have learned from the lessons of the past five years that it is better to be tough at the outset than to regret it later . #% They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna , with temperate tuna , the north and temperate tuna south and other species . #% A significant part of domestic work is undeclared , precarious and underpaid , and domestic workers , mostly women , are vulnerable to abuse , especially when working abroad . #% Finally , what impact , if any , would this have on guaranteeing on a Europe-wide basis the car which may be bought in another state ? #% You have only to look at the fact that 400 000 EU-educated researchers are working in the United States today . #% Great : in a multi-national and cross-party body , that means our message will get through . #% But what our citizens want to know is what is the Council planning to do to ensure the public dissemination of the results of the Cardiff process to all citizens and governments of Member States and accession countries ? #% in writing . - The EU can not claim to be a single market if obstacles to trade still exist . #% The common position represents a delicate balance which supports the principles of liberalisation of the industry while giving due consideration to the particularities of individual Member States . #% I declare an interest in the equestrian area . #% I like the reference to Star Trek in the ` boldly go ' . #% They are restricted from operating outside their local geographic area and provide mainly small amounts of credit for low-income members and for those in financial difficulty . #% I believe that at times , we have to be pragmatic in order to overcome the difficulty . #% Insofar as the POSEIMA programme is concerned , we have to admit that you could not think of a more complicated or indirect or inefficient way to aid islands or remote regions , because in the first place there is no guarantee whatsoever that this money is going to the aid of the people who need it or for whom it was intended . #% You then closed the vote before we had an opportunity to correct our own votes . #% This opened the way for negotiations with the government to start once again , even though there is a wide gulf between the two sides . #% In Parliament , as you probably know , we are currently considering a protocol to extend the EU-ASEAN Agreement to Vietnam . #% They are going to ask the Irish people to vote again on the same Treaty with declarations attached which are not legally binding . #% Madame , I know , I was there ! #% But if it is going to happen there have to be a number of measures taken to ensure that the industries that say this technology is safe take responsibility . #% When we reduce the European Security and Defence Policy to the somewhat farcical theatre of presence or absence at the dining policy at Downing Street , we diminish the idea of Europe itself and we need , from the top down , at the level of the European Council , a commitment to an internally consistent and coherent sense of Europe . #% Unless we take action in this regard , there is a risk that these opportunities will not be available in the peripheral regions and that differences will become even greater . #% As such , our vision must be narrowed : the sustainability of food and the needs of those who do not have automatic access to food must be put first ; farming practices and innovations should be geared towards more food , and the correct crops ; and , as we draft the new CAP bill , we should finally ensure that the new CAP will work towards a carbon-free Europe , and one which does not exacerbate the current carbon problem . #% Without increased trade activity , global growth will slow down and global poverty will rise . #% This is not just about the death of the journalist , horrific as that is ; it is not just about Chechnya ; it is also about Russian treatment of Georgia in the recent past and what they have done . #% I would like first of all to reject the argument made by a number of people here that to increase own resources is to increase the burden of taxation on the citizens of Europe . #% You will not achieve market reform with those bulldozer tactics . #% An enlarged Union will be able to play a more positive and influential role internationally , both politically and economically . #% In this Middle East crisis , as in so many before in this area and around the world , the innocent have suffered most for their leaders ' ambitions . #% I support further research into the effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields on public health and hope that the 1999 recommendation will be reviewed and updated . #% The fishing industry is in crisis and the Commission paper has not helped . #% There is no doubt that this matter of the Irish Box is all-important . #% This is a serious matter , and I trust that tonight the Commissioner will take this to heart and to his very soul . #% 
I have checked with many of the patients ' groups who are alleged to be opposing this directive , and they have told me absolutely categorically that their names were used without their consent . #% I believe that , in keeping with the Millennium Development Goals , the scope of EU development aid should be restricted to the developing countries only . #% For colleagues who are not aware of it , there is yet another general strike in France tomorrow , so the trains will not be able to get here . #% This delayed action and the absence of a coordinated EU response aggravated the environmental impact . #% I welcome also the statement by the Commissioner that governments will be able to use automatic stabilisers in the context of a slow-down in growth . #% We must begin to rebuild that relationship . #% I can say that we have left no stone unturned in tackling this problem , including the removal of entire herds where an infected animal has in fact been diagnosed . #% Renewable energies present us with a paradox . #% But the problem is that the national authorities will not come forward with any sincere proposals to help the fishermen in the region . #% Indeed , in 1994 the report commissioned by the European Commission which looked at this whole area of junior doctors in training highlighted seven points which need immediate action : the excessive hours of work in some countries ; the question of on-call duties ; unrealistic rostering periods ; protracted periods of continuous duty ; the distribution of duties between junior doctors and senior doctors ; informal pressures on doctors in training ; the vulnerability of breaks and time off in the face of the pressure of service needed . #% I thank the President-in-Office . #% Generally , terrorism is found in areas of conflict resolution where unfortunately many of those involved believe in what they are doing . #% Yet never once did anyone challenge our ongoing assessment . #% I would certainly welcome the intensification of the enlargement negotiations between the applicant countries and the European Union . #% It is specifically targeted at job creation , education , training , environmental improvement and state management training because the living conditions of people can actually add to their handicap . #% That is not the fault of the rapporteur , it is down to the fact that we do not have consistent and systematic collection of proper data . #% We also need to remember that a regulatory framework for marketing and using plant protection products already exists under EU law . #% Too much blame is now being levelled at agriculture for this apparent failure of the talks . #% Exposing the common agricultural budget to the vagaries of annual political battles in the European Parliament will wreak untold havoc on farm income and on the viability and competitivity of the European farm sector vis-à-vis the world market . #% We can not continue like this , because it is undermining the credibility of the overall EMU framework . #% There has been some progress to the extent that , as previous speakers have said , even as late as last week there were moves to legalise the teachers ' trade union . #% I believe I said some years ago that compared to national parliaments we were like children playing shop . #% Only one out of 17 equestrian federations throughout Europe was consulted . #% The police have all too often been reluctant , unable , or unwilling to actually start looking for these children until tragically sometimes it is too late . #% The recently introduced legislation , in particular the anti-terrorist statute which was adopted in December , gives judicial powers to the armed forces . #% The Greek Presidency has set a good example of how a presidency should be conducted on behalf of all the Member States and others will do well to follow this example . #% We must retain production and processing capacity to face these future challenges . #% The core issue is to ensure the triumph of order over terror so that democratic stability may indeed be established . #% The European Council decided to participate in international efforts to restore stability and peace to Afghanistan . #% The most crowded airspace in Europe is over South-East England where , this year alone , air traffic controllers are filing a record number of overload reports . #% I believe that an acceptance of this agreement would be an indication of normality and cooperation and as my colleague Mrs McNally said , this is not a normal country , it is not a normal situation , and it should not be endorsed . #% Therefore , contrary to the opinion of the Commissioner for research , the EU does not have the right to overrule national legislation , regulations and ethical guidelines or to insist that Member States have a duty to draw up regulations in the field of embryo research . #% The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977 . #% I am picking up Mr Cushnahan 's question here because , unfortunately , he had to leave . #% - The proposal for this directive deals with situations in which a traffic accident occurs in the country of residence of the person causing the accident or in a third country . #% The new law will save many lives and optimise the organs donated by allowing Member States to share organs . #% As we approach the world trade talks again in November , I urge the Commission to ensure that beef is treated as a sensitive product and that we do not eradicate our own beef producers because of cheap third country imports . #% If we have such a forum as of right , with the proper expertise there to listen to both sides , it will go a long way towards helping everyone to live in peace on this very vexed issue . #% Climate change is happening very quickly , so that reorientation will be inevitable . #% Whole communities in our countries are being destroyed because of widespread unemployment . #% Mr President , I wish to ask the Commissioner how the European Union can so confidently in the preliminary negotiations for Kyoto offer the reductions that they have done and although we have heard this evening how important these targets are - 7.5 % by the year 2005 and 15 % by 2010 - how can we achieve them ? #% I reiterate what the Tánaiste said earlier in the House . #% The main one is the exclusion from certain EU-sponsored schemes of many of the least well-off in our society . #% I believe , with your help , particularly when we have dealt with many of the sensitive political controversies of recent months and the Conference of Presidents , we have been able to hold together , with the stresses and strains and points of emphasis that groups may wish to bring to debates , a coherent parliamentary view . #% We may recall that the European Consumers ' Association , which represents the consumers of the European Union , carried out an extensive survey of charges for cross-border payments only last year . #% I welcome the increased awareness of the European Ombudsman 's role , reflected in the increased numbers taking their complaints to him . #% It is essential that adequate transition arrangements be put in place for regions such as my country , Ireland , which cease to meet Objective 1 qualifying criteria . #% On 30 March 1998 , the Council of Ministers adopted Regulation 850/98 for the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles . #% They found that it did not affect the health of animals and that it was a natural product that did not affect the health of human beings . #% As Mr Cox has said , we campaigned for enlargement but against the Nice Treaty , because it is not in the interests of the countries coming in , nor is it in the interests of the existing Member States . #% I passed a remark . #% It was established last year and I genuinely believe that it is an important forum for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and the Icelandic Parliament . #% I heard this afternoon that the captors have said that they will make no further effort to make contact after 7.30 p.m. our time . #% At present , there is nothing to prevent a European shipowner from exporting his ship to one of these countries , receiving a very healthy subsidy of EUR 1 million or more and still keeping his ship . #% Mr President , the gentleman , his colleagues and his staff should be cleaning up the ` No to Europe ' literature and mess that is strewn around the grounds of this Parliament . #% I support Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya 's proposal for a narrower definition of the term ` reduced mobility ' . #% Mr President , regarding the order in which amendments would be voted , I would suggest that when we look at those amendments referring to the date we take first those furthest away from the Commission 's proposal , which includes a date . #% Hopefully we can find a way to do that . #% in writing . - I abstained on the final vote on the EC-Israel aviation agreement as a mark of protest with regard to the ongoing crisis in Palestine . #% I would remind EFSA that many products , after years of so-called ` safety ' , have been taken off the market . #% There is also the question of Internet pornography . #% In my constituency , an anaerobic digestion plant was recently forced to close because of rigid and unnecessary planning restrictions . #% I recently visited the so-called ` security wall ' and was horrified to find that Palestinians are being walled and fenced into enclaves -- their opportunity to leave these enclaves being totally dependent on the will of Israeli security forces . #% That system eventually incurred costs for the European budget . #% We must take the precautionary approach . #% In voting for the Riis-Jorgensen report today I also fully support the much more imaginative environmental demands made in this report . #% 
Parliament has agreed to change the format of its human rights report to have a much tighter focus on issues where the EU has a direct impact or influence and to focus on EU human rights policy , in particular on guidelines that have been set out and the performance of the three institutions in implementing those guidelines . #% The popular acceptance of non-conventional medicines is a fact of life . #% The Council and Parliament must have a veto right . #% We can all be proud of these achievements because we all played a key role in making them a reality . #% This summer ASEAN is expected to admit Burma as a member . #% I am grateful to the chairman and the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development for addressing the proposal as a priority once it was received from the Commission . #% I grew up in Northern Ireland in the shadow of violence , terrorism and intimidation . #% Criticism of that position will not weaken the Commission but your actions will . #% This entire saga needs to be properly and thoroughly investigated because , forgive the pun , as far as I can see , the whole thing is very fishy . #% In the case of the Irish national airline , Aer Lingus , 40 % of their business and 60 % of their profits are generated on trans-Atlantic routes . #% So it is necessary to apply the law so that they will be forced to take rest and forced not to be on the road when they are simply too tired to drive . #% This now assumes a new urgency by going to the heart of the kind of Union we wish the applicant states to join . #% While I believe this report to be generally of benefit to European businesses , it must also be noted that it could leave the way open for an intensification of the kind of practices carried out by European City Guides . #% If politics were an exact science , the United States of Europe would already exist as the logical culmination of the aims of the Founding Fathers of the European Union , providing security and prosperity for its citizens and exercising a benign but powerful influence on the world stage . #% That is a very serious topic and we need to be properly informed on such research within the boundaries of the European Union . #% Looking ahead to 1997 , I believe that the Commission will have to give more attention to educating young people on the potential advantages of the single currency . #% They do not cover a number of serious issues like Plan Colombia and the grave human rights abuses that are taking place in the country . #% It will eliminate the current opt-out , and introduce strict new conditions on how ` on call ' time can be counted towards the 48-hour week . #% Prime Minister Netanyahu must also be reminded that EU trade agreements require those we do business with to respect those rights . #% We want from you concrete objectives . #% This year , in particular - the International Year of the Disabled - we should also be working more actively towards integrating people with disabilities into the workforce . #% We need to address this . #% The family should represent the safe haven for the child . #% Moreover , financial support will be given to both students and educational staff members who are participating in the Erasmus World initiative . #% There are many other small projects like that , which are run by individuals who saw the need . #% Mr President , first of all on the technical measures . #% Commissioner , can I ask that in seven years ' time the red squirrel be added to that list of biodiversity successes ? #% Mr President , I think the last speaker , Mr Santini , made an error which a lot of people make , confusing nationality and citizenship . #% It increasingly resorts to the use of the Internal Security Act , which allows it to detain people indefinitely without trial if , in the Government 's view , they are suspected of threatening national security . #% This is basically ICES ' way of saying that it is in deep trouble . #% Decision making in this way is not to by-pass democracy , it is to extend democracy . #% It is quite clear from the Treaties that Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament and , despite what the Members over there may try and say and despite what they may try and do , they are flying in the face of law , of constitutional law and of the rights of the people of Europe ! #% We need to look at the single market to ensure that it does not contradict the aims of this directive and we need to make sure that renewables take their full place when we consider the Security of Supply Green Paper . #% Only in the last few days the European Consumers Association has issued a statement in this regard . #% That has to change if we are serious about making it clear that we stand for the human rights of all . #% It was a minimum requirement . #% In Europe today , we have been able to overcome those differences ; we have found a forum and a way forward in which people from different countries , with different ideologies , different histories and different interpretations of the same history can come together and find common ground and a common cause . #% I have several questions to the Council in the time permitted to me . #% So this is disgraceful . #% I believe that great credit is due to the Commission , in particular Commissioner Byrne , for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each of the issues that needed to be tackled to guarantee our consumers a safe and traceable product , from farm to fork . #% A 25-year roll-out for legislation , for example , is hardly acceptable . #% These are essential , and it is appropriate that they be treated as damages to be covered by the compulsory civil liability . #% That is the first thing I would like to know from the Council , in relation to the current situation in Iraq , which definitely can not be left in the hands of the British and the Americans . #% Mr President , I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the Greek Presidency and Commissioner Nielson for the very fine statements that they made here this morning , and to my Parliamentary colleagues for the very enlightening statements they have made as well . #% Somehow the reviewers seem to get funded . #% It is clear that we need a Community patent and that it is a key element in underpinning the Lisbon agenda of encouraging EU innovation and competitiveness . #% So it is not a socially just policy . #% They find themselves more and more burdened in circumstances where it is seriously impeding their competitiveness . #% It is now inconceivable that Commissioner Patten , as he himself has acknowledged , could come to the European Parliament and request money from the EU funds for nuclear transfers . #% The books must be opened up so that the workers and those affected by them can see for the first time where the money has gone and workers ' control must be exercised on the operation of these agencies so that their massive resources are used for the benefit of working people , small farmers and the environment . #% In conclusion , I sincerely hope that this lengthy exercise will bring about some very tangible results . #% Until we deal with that and stop running away from the problem , we are never going to find a solution . #% We agree whole-heartedly with that , and I would say one of the tests that we would have in the back of our minds as a group is this : in five years ' time will we have exported stability to south-eastern Europe , or will we still be importing the consequences of instability ? #% He rightly states that education is an essential part of the development of these countries . #% I have no confidence at all that Member States will maintain or indeed establish adequate standards . #% If the EU is serious about increasing recycling , reducing waste and limiting air emissions and climate change , then it must take action . #% I was extremely impressed recently on visiting the rapporteur 's own constituency , Galicia , to see the contribution that mussel farming has made to their local economy . #% It demonstrates that people are aware that there is a body there that can help them , and the fact that the Ombudsman 's office refers them to the appropriate area where they may receive a resolution of their problem is an important service . #% A recent study carried out by an organisation in my constituency called Cáirde points to the fact that 80 % of people who contract HIV in Ireland are in receipt of welfare payments . #% Ireland , at the best , was getting 2 % , Portugal and the poorer areas of Spain are getting between 1 % and 2 % of GNP . #% The failure today inside and outside the EU to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to both European enterprises and EU and non-EU workers and citizens . #% I hope , Mr Solana , that you will use your role to give an added sense of political urgency to the task of enlargement , rather than to promote procrastination . #% The care a child receives in the earliest years will have an impact on him or her throughout life . #% This is an issue that we will return to again in the run-up to the next IGC . #% While hake may not yet be in such dire straits , it is still far below the level which is appropriate , and the warning bells have been ringing now for quite some time . #% in writing . - The necessity for a comprehensive collection of data on investment in energy infrastructure within the EU is clear - an outline of the major trends occurring in the industry will be needed to allow for proper forward planning and to highlight any potential difficulties . #% 
New technology - in particular digital tachographs and individual smart cards for individual drivers on the tachograph - could be the best way to regulate the hours during which drivers are on the road and at work . #% Ireland neither produces nuclear waste nor reprocesses it . #% So it is here , with the rapporteur trying to require all sites -- regardless of size , product and complexity -- to comply with all articles . #% I do not refer simply to food aid . #% In my own country , the government launched in September a national alcohol policy based on a multi-sectoral approach which marshals a wide range of statutory and non-statutory organizations to work together to reduce the prevalence of alcoholrelated problems in Irish society by emphasizing moderation in alcohol consumption . #% However , this may not be at the expense of rank-and-file workers in the Commission , as was suggested in Paragraph 81 . #% It is all too easy to import a problem , but it is very difficult to tackle a problem once it is within our borders . #% I will mention one in particular because it is relevant to Ireland , and that is Raytheon . #% Mr President , this debate on Strasbourg is not scheduled . #% The OIE meets next week in Paris to consider amendments to their classification system and consequently I hope to bring further amendments to this regulation for second reading . #% If they are serious about Europe and creating a Europe of states and peoples , then we must ensure that equality , cohesion and solidarity rule right across the Union . #% While they state that they support the ban on ` reproductive cloning ' , they have already patented and commercialised human closed cells in order to treat age-related and degenerative diseases . #% From a Community fisheries and socio-economic point of view , its real interest is the hope which it holds out to people of the fisheries-dependent regions of Spain and Portugal , such as Andalucia , the Canary Islands , Galicia and the Portuguese south . #% Mr President , my congratulations also to Mr Lange , who has shown real interest and enthusiasm in presenting his report and his amendments following on for Mr Robles Piquer . #% Mr President , could I object to yesterday 's Minutes . #% Consumers bear the ultimate responsibility for their own food choices . #% But there still remain areas of difference between us . #% I do not agree with the German agricultural minister 's view that export refunds on live cattle can now no longer be justified . #% The European and Irish consumer , as well as the individual producers have a right to know if enhanced competition will result in higher energy costs for the consumer and , of course , the employees working in the industry have the right to know how it is going to affect their jobs . #% A learner 's permit in one country may be equivalent to a full licence in another . #% The Commissioner says that we have attached harsh conditions to these loans , but I was not exactly clear as to what these conditions are and , indeed , if they include social conditionality . #% Our citizens are very concerned and our policies and funding should match their concerns . #% The EU is falling sharply behind in meeting its legally binding undertakings on reducing greenhouse gases . #% That responsibility must also be balanced with the rights of the authors and the creators of these works to ensure that their rights are protected . #% We are pleased that the issues of artisanal and local production of traditional products have been taken into account in the common position . #% If our concerns are for animals , we must have concerns for animals across the world and not just European animals . #% This is because the liberal regime in Ireland , the UK and the Netherlands is not acceptable to other Member States such as Germany and France . #% However , our role should not just be to approve this Fund . #% The situation in Ireland is extremely serious and unless there is some recovery in prices , many farmers will not survive . #% The first course developed was a Diploma in Rural Development and Agri-Business . #% Because the siege has still not been lifted and crossings are still closed , it is very difficult to get essentials to the people . #% The EU can only spend a maximum of 1.2 % of the combined GDP of all its Member States . #% A clear distinction is drawn between discovery and invention . #% The Celtic Tiger , for which you claim credit in Ireland , has given us 150 000 children living in poverty in Ireland . #% First and foremost I should like to thank Stephen Hughes for his report and indeed for seeking to raise the whole issue of gender balance in the boards of the Health and Safety Authority . #% Mental ill health is preventable and treatable . #% Mr President , I -- like most of the other speakers -- would like to concentrate on natural optical radiation , or sunlight . #% They were promised over and over again that the income aids were permanent and would be fully financed . #% This is a market that will grow . #% I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report . #% You congratulated me on my own initiative , Commissioner , but I would like to say that it was very much at the initiative of the Committee on Petitions that this report was drawn up . #% When the United States justifiably initiates a global campaign against organisations responsible for terrorism and the regimes that sponsor it , it is important for us to remind them that they allied themselves to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein when it suited their foreign policy objectives . #% But that is going to be the case if we do not realise what the problem is and how to address it . #% Furthermore , Article J ( 7 ) of the Amsterdam Treaty , a protocol attached to the Treaty , was an Irish addition and intended to prevent the Irish people from knowing the real implications of the Amsterdam Treaty . #% There are 42 million people in the world who are sufferers of the AIDS virus - many of whom are based in Africa - yet the technology and the treatment is available to combat diseases such as AIDS . #% Mr President , 1997 is a critical juncture in terms of setting the future guidelines for cohesion and the regional policy of the EU . #% I do not mind flexibility - that is good in politics - but this seems rather more chaotic than one 's definition of flexibility . #% For them , this is the second year of closure . #% I have no doubt that the current EU-Israel Association Agreement should be suspended . #% I would , however , like to make three points . #% in writing . - We all wish this new Commission well . #% We also call for the safe repatriation under the Cambodia/Vietnam UNHCR agreement . #% On a broader front , I can not emphasise strongly enough the importance of SMEs to both the Irish and the European economies . #% In particular , I would appeal for a guarantee for the safety of church personnel . #% I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , which was assured by the Commission that early warning systems had been put in place by the European Union to deal with humanitarian aid missions of this sort . #% While I welcome the debate - I welcome both sides of the debate taking place in this House - I say to the Greens that I am very disappointed at the type of amendments they have put down in the House supporting the regulation and free distribution of drugs . #% The Hague Convention is a good piece of legislation , though it is not quite good enough . #% He has learned to play the international community like an old violin , instinctively knowing how much pressure he can put on the strings without causing them to break . #% I am very glad that he is not as ill as he looked , but we must have resuscitative equipment in the House , given not only the conditions but some of our ages and I include myself in that . #% Mr President , there are grave defects in the Council proposal because the environmental and energy-saving clauses are aspirational only and the Charter will provide no binding legal instruments for dealing with what are admitted on all sides to be really grave environmental degradation and pollution and seriously deficient energy-saving norms in the Eastern European states , which they show no signs of changing . #% A few amendments were accepted at committee and I would urge the Commission to indicate that it would take them on board . #% This is the question - both parliamentary and political - but for a different reason , to the President of the Socialist Group . #% The ageing nature of our population , globalisation and technological advances present real challenges for European economic and social development . #% It also means that the US , the UK and the others who supported them are pursuing a shoot-to-kill policy - i.e. we believe or suspect the Iraqis have weapons of mass destruction , therefore we go in , we shoot and kill the people and then afterwards we find out there was no justification for this action . #% I appeal for mercy and assurance that she will not be executed under any circumstance . #% Another problem with the management of the MAGPs by the Commission relates to the waters beyond the European Union . #% 
Yet they are being prevented from doing so and in fact , those brave enough to do so have lost their lives . #% We must ensure that any EU directive tackling this issue contains no loopholes and that it is satisfactorily implemented in all member states . #% That is an overstatement of the situation . #% So it is not entirely true to say that there is nothing before the Council . #% That is a scientific fact , not a passionate policy comment on my part . #% I think by the time of the Dublin European Council we will see real progress . #% My group will take this challenge seriously and we look forward to cooperating with the Council and the Commission in improving the Agenda 2000 proposals to gain support from the public . #% It is not helpful in terms of prevention to know the overall number of road fatalities . #% We can not afford any weakening of quality standards . #% Finally , I agree with you that they must commit to implementing policies consistent with ILO fundamental principles and rights and they must not allow the current economic crisis to be used as an excuse to weaken or disregard internationally recognised labour standards . #% It is all very well to complain about it , but we have to ask the question ` why ' ? #% It is a disgrace that a country of the European Union is led by a man who can present these ideas in this day and age , particularly when the country is Italy , which in my view has always led in terms of modern ideas . #% However , before I do that , let me just say a few words about the EU budget talks that are ongoing for 2007 onwards . #% Our warmest congratulations to you . #% Mr President , a debate on human rights in the European Union should be an occasion to highlight issues of major importance . #% It means it conforms to the Directive on electrical equipment , and that is why , today , we are putting to you three requests : to examine the concept of a supplementary marking to enhance consumer information on product safety , to carry out an in-depth study in order to clarify the feasibility , the possible benefits and the potential drawbacks for such a marking for all stakeholders , including business and consumers , and to examine the possibilities for reinforcing the credibility of the CE marking through measures for stronger customs control inside and outside the European Union , to make sure we end the consumer confusion as regards the CE marking . #% I am delighted that the Commissioner and his staff have been adaptable enough to recognise that if the proposals put forward are not working as originally designed , the best thing to do is to , for example , concentrate on fewer projects in a more focused way and to increase the Commission contribution , since the 10 % clearly was not stimulating the sort of initiatives we wanted . #% Attacks on living standards and democratic rights need to be jointly defeated by Israeli and Palestinian workers . #% I am glad to hear that he is alive and well . #% Madam President , I was here in Parliament when the Chernobyl explosion took place . #% What do the employers do , line up their employees on a Monday morning and check their skin types and whether they have been overexposed at the weekend ? #% That is an appalling message to give to the people of Ireland , who had to vote twice on the Nice Treaty . #% I would also appeal to Member States to spend the funds which are there to spend and not to continue with the increasing underspending and delays and bureaucracy . #% One of the primary duties of the EU has to be to provide a secure source of food for its people . #% Her Majesty 's Customs and Excise have been able to cut the cross-Channel bootlegging of tobacco by an impressive 76 % since March 2000 . #% However , if we discover that banks have failed to comply with their obligations regarding similar or equal charges both domestic and abroad , and if we find that there are usury rates being added by banks with regard to operation of a card from one Member State to another , what action can be taken by an individual consumer , without going through the whole rigmarole of making an official complaint to the Commission ? #% From the outset , had I been allowed to draft this report in the Irish language , the problem would not have arisen because I would have used the word , which , unlike the English word ` fisherman ' , is gender-neutral and embraces all those involved in the sector . #% While there are risks and benefits , I feel very strongly that partial decoupling proposals pose a far greater risk with no prospect of decrease in regulation . #% One of the important points to emerge from the research was that , with the exception of Ireland , the elderly have the highest suicide rates in the population . #% I believe we are different . #% Question 9 by my colleague , Mrs McGuinness , is very close to my own , question 11 , and again , we are not going to get to another question . #% In theory , nobody should be against it but I suspect there is much disparity in some areas , especially under the third pillar . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work . #% The current draft will not lead to an increase in nuclear safety in the EU or the accession countries , because all nuclear states in the EU and the accession countries are already parties to the International Atomic Energy Agency 's Nuclear Safety Convention and must already report on the safety of nuclear power stations . #% This Constitution will give us more democracy , more rights and more potential for a prosperous society in Europe , and indeed for solidarity with the rest of the world . #% The word ` interoperability ' is appearing increasingly frequently . #% I sent a letter to President Barroso - signed by a number of MEPs - and he replied that the Commission have moved quickly to authorise three modified GM products , and a fourth on the way . #% The full cooperation of Member States is needed if the European Union is to play its full part in reducing the level of greenhouse emissions . #% Parliament has insisted on targets for re-use and recycling of waste . #% How much of the reduction of the capacity from Member States has gone over there and what impact is this having on the resources in that area ? #% The Commission can not continue to ignore what citizens are saying . #% Given the clarity of the comments initially made by Commissioner Patten , to some extent echoed today , we need to have more assurances that Member States are taking sufficient action . #% We can give them what they ask for : financial assistance in their struggle . #% Mr President , there is no disagreement on the fact that we want to comply with this piece of legislation . #% It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation . #% It is contrary to the principle of proportionality and , most importantly , it is contrary to the rules of the WTO which require the use of performance standards , not design standards , as is the case in this regulation . #% However , the proposal that judicial cooperation in the field of civil matters should be governed by qualified majority voting is contentious . #% However , I would suggest to this House today that , as the people of Northern Ireland see some 200 convicted terrorists released on the streets , without any effort on the part of the terrorists to hand in their weapons , it as a democratic parliament would want to lend its voice in support of those who want to support the democratic way , and urge them to do it democratically , hand in their weapons and rid us of the plague of terrorism on both sides of the divide . #% The only way we will do that is if we give the social dimension of Europe - the social convergence that is needed in Europe - the same status as we give to monetary convergence and to economic convergence . #% Mr President , the Minutes do not record my presence yesterday . #% This is really the central dichotomy that exists within the Union at this time . #% If anything , it should provide the political imperative to ensure that it never happens again . #% I welcome the Commission 's efforts to tackle the problem , in particular through the establishment of a task force in DG Regio in April 2002 and I reiterate our call to the Commission , when it submits future reports , to give more detailed information about the projects financed . #% The Commission should consider using Article 182 ( 5 ) as a legal basis for all future proposals for joint programming of research activities . #% If the existing Member States can not comply with the existing legislation and can not meet their targets then it is going to be very difficult to argue and to push for the new countries coming in to do the same , since they come from an economically less well-off background . #% The IND/DEM Group agrees with Mr Schulz that Commissioner McCreevy should be called before this House to account for his statements on the European social model . #% We know that when there is doubt about a particular measure , the European Parliament must apply the precautionary principle . #% Since March this year , opponents of President Obiang 's regime have been arbitrarily detained and tried under deplorable and unacceptable conditions . #% We have all seen how volatile currency markets can be . #% In external relations , as with previous presidencies , the Middle East will once again be a priority issue . #% This language is not appropriate to the sensitivities and subtleties required in this historic debate and it constitutes loose talk which opens up an appalling prospect , not least in the hearts and minds of those who support enlargement , and especially in candidate States and in their capital cities . #% Firstly , I would like to say that even though I was here for the Theato report I did not participate for exactly the same reasons as Mr Heaton-Harris . #% We have been eating scrapie-infected sheep for over two hundred years , with no ill effect , and that is because the structure of the shape of the prion , the non-infectious protein , in the sheep , is not compatible to that in the human brain , unlike the rendered cattle or beef prion , that replaces the protein necessary in our brains . #% We look forward in Northern Ireland to continuing support from our friends in the European Union and we thank you for it . #% This can only be achieved by recognizing that agriculture will continue to play the pivotal role in rural areas for the foreseeable future and that structural policy should be geared towards the maximizing the development of allied sectors such as agri-tourism , food processing and the preservation of environmentally sensitive areas . #% Why should it be possible for ropey convictions , secured by lesser standards than those applicable in the United Kingdom , to be held against United Kingdom citizens in their own country ? #% 
On behalf of the people of Northern Ireland , I thank those who have worked so hard to ensure that this report was able to go through its parliamentary stages at speed . #% Is it yours ? #% They will have seen the efforts made by groups to work in partnership , to rebuild communities . #% They brief us extremely well after the event , outside the door , but we are never let in , not even as observers at the high-level meetings . #% I would like to support her in this and , if anything , express the hope that we can soon add to the list more chemicals such as antimony , dioxins , and fluorosilic acid . #% Cooperation between police forces , where there is widespread information on prostitution amongst young girls in the Member States , has unfortunately to be an intrinsic part of our asylum policy . #% Will this proposal for a regulation also end up in a fourth reading in Luxembourg ? #% Therefore , I would ask the Commission , when it gets this report back from the Parliament , to study very carefully the effect in every single country . #% In food and water it is a curse . #% For any government to propose that incineration should be introduced instead of landfill is completely misguided . #% I did not realize until I took up this brief just how complex motor vehicles can be . #% We welcome that , but the standing veterinary committee seems to be engaged in delaying tactics . #% They are thereby depriving both the urban and rural poor of the full benefit of funds and , indeed , state aid . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to respond to the first speaker , who indicated that he had difficulties in respect of the exploitation of young seasonal workers in Northern Ireland , the constituency that I represent . #% These waters must be protected . #% There are question marks relating to silicon implants which have not been answered by studies to date , and I would urge further research on that . #% I would like an assurance from the Council that the EU Commission will actually step aside from the process on this and allow the people to make up their own mind and that it will be in accordance with the constitution of Ireland which prohibits the use of public money to promote one side of the argument in a referendum . #% I entirely agree with his analysis of the situation . #% One has to really ask the question : who is the American Government really out to save ? #% The proposals , if adopted , would increase the level of plaice stocks to above the precautionary levels of three to five years . #% But equally we believe that it is important that a well-founded national anxiety should not be transformed into a collective European angst and political deadlock . #% It is extremely important . #% This is therefore an ideal means of supplementing the demand . #% Clearly , the problem with fisheries agreements has to be addressed . #% Again , I urge MEPs and the Commission to be realistic and to be cautious with the money we have and with which we should aim to bring maximum benefit to our constituents . #% Mr President , I am glad to see Commissioner Kinnock here , but where is Commissioner Prodi ? #% I should like to thank Mr Trakatellis for an excellent report and I also thank the Commissioner for being so honest with us here this morning and stating that this Community action plan on health already needs to be reviewed if it is to be effective , so that we can prioritise areas , because of -- and I use his words -- ` the accounting muddle ' . #% Thanks to British Midland International and the good work of their staff , I got here rather late , but still I am here . #% It is extremely important that , in the tackling of poverty reduction , education is given a high priority . #% This killing was ruthlessly supervised and forensically covered up by men announcing that their activities were IRA business , by men who proceeded to intimidate the 70 witnesses to the crime and their families , first forbidding them from calling an ambulance on the night in question , as Robert McCartney bled to death before their eyes and his colleague lay seriously injured . #% This practice of social dumping is wholly unacceptable and the European Union has a responsibility to protect the rights of all workers , including seafarers who work European waters . #% He made the very concrete statement that the child can not be dealt with in isolation but in the context of the family and community . #% The Summit was unable to achieve a satisfactory outcome on a target for increasing the share of renewable energy in global energy production . #% I salute the courage of the hundreds of gay people and their supporters who braved the hate campaign against them to march in the Baltic Pride parade in Lithuania 's capital , Vilnius , in May of last year . #% You only have to look at the financial situation right throughout the European Union at the moment to see that we have a terrible problem here and one that is not going to be easy to address . #% I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions , not just between Commission and Parliament , but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge . #% Nearly EUR 44.8 billion is due to be allocated to the common agricultural policy next year and I very much welcome the support that the European Union is giving to agriculture in general . #% I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group . #% We have had a dramatic breakthrough in the last 24 hours , but let nobody here take it for granted that the road to peace - a just and lasting peace - is going to be easy . #% The Union gives three-fifths of all aid to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States . #% I share the Council ' s view that flexibility in this sector is absolutely essential . #% On the ICBAN board there are twenty members , only three of whom are now from the unionist community . #% These attacks culminated recently in a classic hatchet job programme made by an English television company and broadcast in three or four of the Member States . #% Our hearings also will be fair . #% It is my view that if the industry in Europe abides by a binding code of conduct and the only arms being traded are legitimate and consistent with that code , it is then inappropriate to burden the industry with an extra tax . #% This is causing serious problems because at the heart of that legislation is the recognition of the right of every child to know and have access to both its parents . #% The candidate countries must implement the full range of EU directives and regulations . #% I am a member of the Irish Government 's Task Force on the demand side of the problem which recently published an interim report . #% I welcome in particular the decision hold a seminar on the fringes involving the tourism stakeholders . #% Mr President , there is also one matter I would like to raise , and that is the relationship of drugs to this problem . #% Such an initiative would , in my view , restore not only consumer confidence in food but also public confidence in the EU itself . #% I was delighted yesterday to see the Council and the Commission here continuing the support which they have always given to the Northern Ireland peace process . #% Two years ago I wrote to Commissioner Mario Monti renewing my call for a study . #% The Irish Government too has a right and duty to defend its policy preferences , where it feels it is right to do so . #% Do not listen to people who are creating obstacles . #% It seems to me that there is a lot of work to be done in terms of developing the notion of European citizenship and it is a mistake to reduce it to the notion of political citizenship , although that is an important aspect of it . #% It is appropriate that provisions be made to deal with unforeseen circumstances during the pilot period of 2005 to 2007 . #% On the issue we are debating here today , I would like to say that we face a weekend that is immensely important for the Union . #% I am quite convinced that some of these actors think we do not mean what we say . #% On one of my many visits to the area , I have seen flowers and strawberries rotting , lying in the streets of Gaza and being eaten by the donkeys while their Palestinian producers look on helplessly in despair . #% It would be better all round if the investigations were to be conducted in a completely independent manner so that it could be seen to be objective and impartial by all sections of the community . #% That would mean IEP 700 m per year being put into the protection of pension payments for people from the year 2025 onwards . #% If possible , could the Commission make resources available to make sure this woman has proper legal representation to guarantee that she has a fair hearing and that every resource is utilised to save her life ? #% The complexity and the lack of clarity of the Nice Treaty allowed a huge range of issues to be tagged onto the debate during the Irish referendum , issues relevant and irrelevant to Nice , causing concern and fear among the people , which resulted in a huge abstention with a paltry 34 % turnout , of whom 54 % voted `` no '' . #% He believes in providing incentives for the rich by giving them more wealth , more profits and more tax incentives -- and in providing incentives for the poor by giving them a kick in the arse . #% I wish to place on the record the fact that I did not participate in the vote on the Lambert report ( A5-0333 / 02 ) . #% 
Mr President , I warmly endorse this report and I would like in particular to speak on the issue of Turkey , given the recent unfortunate remarks by Mr Giscard d'Estaing . #% So where did the Structural Funds go ? #% author . - Madam President , I would like to apologise , because it is not normal that I do not turn up when I am supposed to speak . #% It is important to bear in mind that this is an issue that can not be regulated by private enterprise . #% The low-cost model of air travel has been a huge success . #% The agricultural proposals , as represented in Agenda 2000 , are not satisfactory , particularly from an Irish perspective . #% I believe there is still a lot of support for that idea and I hope that the Commission will consider this idea as part of a strategy to give greater control to the local communities . #% Mr President , I just wish to make two points . #% In the Russian Federation , they have collected data discussed at the Minsk Conference showing significant rates of cancer and leukaemia are dose-related - which means radiation-induced . #% Our market is open . #% It goes without saying that any sudden adjustment or withdrawal of funds would have a detrimental effect on the Irish economy and would serve to undermine the success that we have achieved in recent times . #% It was never a possibility , considering the detail and the complications of this regulation , that our objectives for spending in the year 2000 could be achieved . #% Compared with the agreements with the ACP countries , this is a much more equitable agreement in that it is not an exploitation of the country involved ; Latvians will be employed . #% Do not kid yourselves ! #% I am also pleased to note from opinion polls in Iceland that 65 % of the Icelandic people want the negotiations to continue . #% In fact , in many scenarios they are treated as inferior beings to the rest of society . #% The Commissioner quite rightly pointed out that it is an issue that has to be pursued through the UK courts . #% Is she aware that its liabilities for cleaning up after the closure of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste run to GBP 34 billion , while it has GBP 235 million worth of shareholders ' funds on its balance sheets ? #% The issue of taxation must remain the preserve and remit of the individual Member States ' governments . #% There must be some restrictions and some controlling mechanisms and methods with regard to that liberalisation . #% I understand the difficulties that creates . #% The Göteborg European Council decided that those applicant countries which are ready to join the European Union may complete accession negotiations by the end of this year . #% Nobody lives there . #% Mr President , it is surely amazing that the president of the Court of Auditors has to report on the loss of millions by the Commission . #% You can do better . #% Clarity in the budget line , so that we can measure here in Parliament that you are meeting those commitments , and additionality are absolutely central to this . #% It is for the citizens of a Member State to decide whether or not they will choose to fund national political parties or independent representatives . #% We must create an EU that complements the role of the Member State , not one that undermines it . #% As he is in the Chamber tonight , I want him to appreciate that serious statement of concern by European citizens . #% The criteria for EU funding only of pan-European political parties exclude and therefore discriminate against smaller national parties and independents . #% It could assist in aiding market access for businesses , by supporting the role of the single point of contact for businesses to get into the single market in services , known as the ` one-stop shop ' . #% The general public throughout the EU are very much opposed to the use of animals for something that is completely unnecessary . #% I come from a country which exports over 90 % of its entire beef production and quality and consumer satisfaction have always been a priority . #% In the area of environment energy , and particularly emissions-related tax incentives , I have one observation and one question for the Commissioner . #% This REACH regulation aims to maintain a strong chemicals industry within the internal market , while providing a high level of protection for human health and the environment . #% However , there is a need to review the criteria for qualifying for this aid . #% We need to ensure that the impact of any future directive furthers rather than fragments the internal market as Member States interpret , implement or enforce such a directive to fit in with their own different national approaches . #% In Malta , Ireland is being used as an example of how you can be a Member of the European Union and a wonderful economic success and still remain neutral . #% It is completely unacceptable to let EU vessels continue fishing undisturbed regardless of the fact that there is a conflict there . #% I leave you with a short quotation by George Bernard Shaw , the Irish author , that I used on my first day in this Chamber : ` The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them , but to be indifferent to them : that 's the essence of inhumanity . ' #% I appreciate her call for an increased role for fishermen in the decision-making process and the emphasis that she has put on conservation of fish stocks and environmental considerations . #% While the people in my constituency identify with nationalist sentiment and aspirations in Northern Ireland they are by no means in any way hostile to the Unionist population in Northern Ireland , to their aspirations or their vision of the future for themselves . #% But I would like to ask how you think extradition requests will work when , for instance , material originates in third countries , where perhaps the same kind of basic legislation does not exist ? #% The delay has been unwarranted and undignified and it has cast you in a light and in a role where you do not properly belong . #% We have decided to change our rules to make it clear to everyone that we will monitor expenditure in every spending committee . #% Madam President , it has been an interesting debate . #% If we are to seriously pursue our long-term aim of food security then clearly we need resources to match our aspirations . #% That does not mean that we should not be able to disagree on occasions , especially when we believe the strategy to be wrong . #% While I can distinguish between indirect taxes such as VRT and direct taxes such as income and corporation tax , Member States are entitled to order their affairs so that motorists contribute to the cost of providing public services , especially to the cost of road and rail construction and the maintenance of our roads . #% As Parliament 's rapporteur on Hong Kong , I am fully behind what they are asking in the House today . #% However , the most extraordinary thing in this report is the reference to the market and the creation and availability of new financial resources and the rationality of European stock markets . #% I could not go as far as Graefe zu Baringdorf . #% We are glad that the excessive administrative costs have not been applied to inshore fishermen but , nevertheless , we welcome what has been done so far . #% Ireland is not even a full member of WEU , so why does it need to cooperate more with the WEU presidency and on what issues will it be cooperating ? #% At the end of all this wasted expenditure , the French will still want to be French and the British will still want to be British , and no one but the political Euro-elite will prize citizenship of Europe above that of their own country . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to congratulate Mr Lechner in the preparation and presentation of his report which my group can support in principle . #% As regards the wording and terminology , we did go to some considerable trouble when having the report translated to have the correct title in each language . #% This is only right and proper because the European Union has both national and international obligations to implement more environmentally friendly legislation . #% I would love to have somebody at the head of that Union who is and was a politician , who was part of different ideologies , who recognised the errors of his ways in his youth , who came forward and changed those ways to reflect what was most needed . #% I want to compliment Commissioner Verheugen for what he said in relation to Turkey . #% To create and sustain jobs , the European Union must become the most competitive economic area in the world and I am delighted to welcome the Council 's decision to establish the Competitiveness Council . #% Since you invite oral questions for Commissioners for parts one , two and three , why is it that after the second half hour we did not revert to the first question of part three ? #% We are breathing new life into the Western European Union , which should have actually been defunct last year . #% But at the Council meeting in December , the Council set 199 TACs in total . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mr Caudron and Commissioner Busquin for their hard work in difficult circumstances . #% The European Union recognizes the need for further improvements and progress in the whole area of implementation of human rights and democratic freedoms in Turkey . #% 
I am pleased to say that all the ideas contained in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry have been included in the report in one form or another . #% Regardless of what they spoke about at that conference -- and they were all highly educated , sophisticated women -- the issue of Palestine was mentioned by every single person . #% It strikes me that while we talk consistently , and correctly , about the need to create equal opportunities in the European Union that in a very real sense that is a secondary objective to treating people with equality , because there is a distinct difference between the question of equality for every single human being and the idea that they should also have equal opportunities . #% Agreeing to the integration of the two directives would amount to allowing hazardous waste to be burnt in plants intended for household waste , and vice versa . #% The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the fundamental principles of the EU . #% With the reform , under the Agenda 2000 proposals , of the structural and cohesion funds , perhaps an opportunity could be found to make new funding available , not only for research and development as regards how the new technologies may be best adapted but also for cooperative programmes between the local authorities and the Member States at a local , as well as a European Union , level to try and resolve some of these difficulties and problems . #% Now we have been given a new opportunity to do something . #% As things now stand , neither side will stand back for long enough to allow these intense emotions to abate . #% It is , in my view , deplorable that the PPE seek to undermine our joint rapporteurship and negotiations with the German presidency . #% It is especially important to monitor , and act on , the gender dimension of poverty , violence and the needs of girl-children . #% For example , proposals on fusion are out of date . #% This does not mean rubber-stamping bad practice in Europe , but developing good practice for the future , good law , good patent examiners , and a quick death for applications that are clearly not inventions . #% That is why I welcome that fact that most of it will be spent at the rate of 50 % rather than 75 % . #% We are not proposing the patenting of software as in the US . #% But we are at one minute to midnight for such a solution . #% Madam President , I thank the Commissioner . #% If that is not the case I will communicate it to the Member . #% The threat to confiscate quota is an attempt to pressure farmers into poor arrangements and to sell against their will . #% Because domestic work takes place largely within the family home , there can be issues of privacy involved . #% The country is proud of you . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to pay tribute to my colleagues Mr Oostlander and Mr Barón Crespo for their excellent report which I support . #% New structural funds have been allocated to it and will be re-routed away from the project if work does not commence by the year 2000 . #% Decisions and objectives of the recovery plans can not disregard the social and economic consequences which they will have . #% We need to use the knowledge in better ways . #% Secondly , I want to dissociate myself from any eulogy to so-called President Arafat . #% We need now to look for some degree of legislative creativity , so that there is no sclerotic dysfunction : wanting to do the right thing , but by chance arriving at another dispute . #% In conclusion , people are beginning to take a very pessimistic approach at this stage and , on balance , the overall proposal is likely to be rejected tomorrow . #% I voted against budget lines B7-6312 , Arndt 605 and Arndt 361 . #% UN drugs officials in Afghanistan are calling for balanced measures that encourage farmers to find alternative income and increase the legal risk to anyone involved in the trade . #% Let us bring everyone on board and let the industry be listened to and , above all , take on board some of its very good ideas . #% The impact assessment adopted earlier by the Commission shows that Ireland is one of countries particularly vulnerable to price reductions for sugar and sugar beet . #% We must be on guard though about bringing pet animals in from third countries , because any cases of rabies which are found in the EU at the moment come from third countries where rabies is still endemic . #% I would appeal to Commissioner Wallström to address that issue and to raise the matter with the college of Commissioners . #% The core goal of a reformed CFP must be to ensure that fishermen can earn a decent livelihood while also achieving environmental sustainability . #% There is a necessity for their data-protection systems to be put in place and to be clear for all to see in operation and to understand . #% Freedom can never be given away . #% I welcome this report 's dedication to a policy to vaccinate to live . #% The way Members of this House , across all political groups , have responded to date has been extremely heartening . #% From children to pensioners , from the corporate sector to small business , each will be exposed to this significant milestone in European administration . #% Mr President , in the context of the concerns and wider debate on combating obesity and other chronic diseases , the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation , based on nutrient profiling , will have absolutely no impact . #% in writing . - The effects of climate change are being felt now : temperatures are rising , icecaps and glaciers are melting and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more intense . #% I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group . #% We have a mountain to climb , but I am confident that the people in Ireland and the rest of Europe will rise to the challenge when they are given the chance . #% This will remain so whether public service providers are in the public or private sector . #% In my view we are now prepared to resort to extreme measures and I accept Commissioner Byrne ' s view that in the present situation they are the minimum necessary . #% Some government finances are indispensable prerequisites for economic stability and economic progress . #% Everyone has to cooperate if we are to succeed . #% The Commission report was originally scheduled for 1990 but , for a variety of reasons , it was delayed until last summer . #% The Doha Round must succeed in order to strengthen the multilateral trade system to ensure the progress and harmonious development of the world economy . #% A large number of paragraphs and recommendations from my opinion have been incorporated into the text of the report and I thank Mrs Bauer for her cooperation in that regard . #% Reaching our target of investing 3 % of our GDP on R&D by 2020 could mean a return of 3.7 million jobs and almost EUR 800 billion . #% We need , as the phrase goes , research by women , for women - so that the gender implications of the research we undertake are examined - and about women . #% One of the great weaknesses of the past has been a lack of efficient enforcement and member countries aiding and abetting that . #% The matching of skills to jobs is crucial , but I am very concerned on many fronts , Commissioner . #% I am going to put on the record the views of some of those sections of civil society whose voices have not been heard in the preparation of this directive . #% Thus , it is vital that we investigate whether very small agencies can be effective and can meet the administrative requirements of the Financial Regulations with a very small staff . #% In the last decade , brain-imaging technology has backed up those observations , demonstrating that there is a definite shift in the child 's brain that allows him or her to internalise the primary care-giver , usually the mother , so that she is available to the child in active memory even when she is not present . #% The testing of all animals over 30 months and the removal of specified risk material should go a long way in restoring consumer confidence . #% We have been dealing with this dossier for over a year now and it was a way forward . #% Mr President , I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this very important subject . #% There is a gap between aspirations and their realization , rhetoric and substance , and economic guidelines and their implementation . #% We want you , Commissioner , to take action in this area . #% I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought , where the crops have failed , and where , in six months ' time , we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands . #% It is only right and proper that we negotiate a new regulatory framework for exports or products not covered by Annex I as part of the WTO Millennium Round . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Péry for her report and to say that I agree with her when she implies that the common fisheries policy is just a half-baked policy . #% It cheapens every one of us and our daughters . #% 
Even bananas , Boeing , beef , etc. represent no more than 2 % of the flow of transatlantic trade . #% May your affection and obvious love of this Parliament , of these European institutions prove to be infectious as you address gatherings throughout your term in office . #% It would otherwise have had a very distorting effect on the energy market across Europe . #% It is important to understand that a Commissioner , Commissioner Verheugen in this case , has a role to speak for Europe . #% This matter may be highlighted to an even greater extent with the advent and introduction of the single currency next year . #% Even in rich regions they will appreciate the fact that the European Union tries to help close the gap between rich and poor . #% The promotion of democracy , respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are all values which form an integral part of the Union which we have built together over the past number of years . #% At the same time , the European public is well aware - since 60 % of them or more work in service industries - that there are possibilities for EU firms in widespread trade in services . #% It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important . #% A lot of talking is going on , but there is very little action . #% It has also seen families of children with disabilities badly treated , like the O'Cuanachains , hounded through the courts at a cost of millions just this year instead of their five-year-old child being given an appropriate education . #% It should also aim to change negative public perceptions of the disease . #% I will give you a very good example of that : in the 1994 to 1999 reforms the then Conservative government submitted a map to DG IV in the hope that those areas would then automatically be Objective 2 areas . #% I wish to take the opportunity of warning the Council and the Commission to be careful , as Mr McCreevy 's continued eurosceptic approach could well be an indication of his intention to provoke another row with the EU over Ireland 's budgetary policy in the run-up to a possible autumn Irish general election . #% I know from the very impressive representations that I have received from the medical profession - and I want to thank them for that - that more young women are actually suffering now from lung cancer . #% Let us hope that our resolution will bring some justice to these people , will help them re-settle in their homelands and achieve some results . #% It has little that is credible to contribute , for , when it mattered , the EU as an organisation and most EU Member States left the heavy lifting to others . #% SMEs very much fall on both sides of the argument , some wanting to protect their ideas and inventions and others fearing a patents minefield with the proposed common position . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your very direct and clear answer . #% EU citizens demanded we take action to keep the products of the cruel commercial hunt out of the EU . #% The herring sector referred to by Mr Gallagher is worthy of special consideration at the moment . #% Not only fishermen , but also the general public of Ireland see the Irish Box as being of serious concern to them . #% If the UN team concludes that war crimes have indeed occurred , then the international community must take action including referring the matter to the International War Crimes Tribunal . #% The list is extensive and we are taking it on trust . #% We must make rural development work for people and the places in which they live . #% Mr President , while I welcome what has been said by the Council and the Commission , the reality today is that there is an ever-growing demand for fossil fuels . #% They must ` Show the red card to forced prostitution ' . #% In fact this was leaked by an Islamabad-based diplomat for a Member State government , who was in Europe at the time , and was designed to undermine the work of the EU/EOM . #% Where was the Tony Blair of the Good Friday Agreement , a man of understanding and goodwill , who could bring both sides of an intractable conflict to the table ; a man who showed singular courage on the Iraq question , regardless of our views of the right or wrong . #% Look at the human demographic situation , where we have an ageing population , a dropping birthrate in most Member States , and where we do not have strategies to respond to that . #% I can give her more information on that later . #% Consumers are understandably concerned and confused . #% Let us be clear : without this directive , patents will continue to be filed . #% We have them on the table ; we are going to have to give more . #% Clearly this has not been the case and must be viewed as an abject failure for the so-called humanitarian aid programmes the EU is supposed to operate on occasions like this . #% I call upon the Council today to amend the Treaty to include a specific , legally sound reference to children and to citizens ' rights for them . #% On the other hand , we must be careful that the arrival of new members is not detrimental to the future workings of the Treaties . #% There is also agreement that the Chargés d'Affaires could return to Iraq from the Member States of the Union . #% This shows arrogance , even when they are called to account . #% The very fact that we have Dell workers ' committee representatives here tonight watching this shows just how deeply this fund has reached the workers of Dell and how they welcome it so much . #% The EU has had to take emergency measures for three cod stocks and northern hake and it is clear that other stocks will soon be added to the list . #% Would the President-in-Office consider having a weekend across the European Union where similar sporting and cultural exchanges take place , so that we use sport to fight xenophobia ? #% The future of the common agricultural policy and structural funds , together with the obvious need for a bigger budget in an enlarged Union , are all difficult political issues which should be tackled in parallel with the Intergovernmental Conference . #% I have therefore tabled amendments for the plenary which address both of these issues . #% But in the context of the current disaster there , Indonesia has become a symbol of the lengths to which a brutal , weak and unscrupulous regime will go to further its power and control over those it perceives as challenging its authority . #% People will be none the wiser , because we do not have labelling . #% At best , it could be described as a reasonable basic document with which to start the discussion , but it lacks any concrete objectives and , as I said , any ambition . #% Specifically , how quickly will we be able to utilise this mechanism in the case of serious market disruption ? #% That is exactly what this Parliament does not want . #% It is a well known fact that there is no effective public control mechanism of secret services and their undemocratic activities anywhere in the world . #% . I am fully supportive of the ideas in the Commission communication . #% Farmers who in good faith were working to the stipulated deadline are quite clearly disadvantaged . #% Despite the fact that I had passes for them to go into the visitors ' gallery , they have been prevented from doing so . #% in writing . - We have voted overwhelmingly today to maintain the political momentum behind a global financial transaction tax ( FTT ) . #% Can the position be improved on as a matter of urgency ? #% In the UK and Ireland we indeed have a liberal regime and consumers there do not want their rights restricted . #% The definition of the family goes far beyond the accepted norm in most Member States and other countries ; this issue should have been addressed more sensitively and the report fails badly in this respect . #% I should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on his report , which contains many good things : an admittance that pharmaceuticals can cause more mental illness than they cure ; a recognition of the importance of childhood for mental health with a call for support for families ; a recognition that employment can affect mental health for better and for worse ; and the need to consult those who have recovered from mental illness to learn how recovery happened . #% If our turn is never to be reached , we should be told to put down a written question to the Commissioners . #% A review of the first year of the code is due in March 2007 and this will assist us in making decisions about the effectiveness or otherwise of such codes . #% The Community is asking that they reduce the fishing effort , their tonnage of boats and their intake . #% Immigrants and those we feel uncomfortable with in society are branded , as criminals are today . #% I would like to know which legal base you are using to consult Member States on these issues . #% Even a small earthquake in the Cumbrian region could breach the storage tanks . #% The deaths involved in such tragedies are often preventable , but we have to convince our Member States that when it comes to seatbelts , our children 's lives are not negotiable . #% If both ends of the chain are operating illegally , we must not only halt all MOX shipments but we must also halt the production of MOX fuel . #% 
The continent of Europe accounts for about 10 % of all accidents worldwide , while one third of air traffic takes place in European skies . #% Similarly , today we are spending about the same amount of money on the policy as we spent 15 years ago , but only half the number of farmers are involved . #% A new method has to be found which leads to results that are understood and accepted by all of us , involving national and regional parliaments and , indeed , civil society . #% We are not doing anything whatsoever about it . #% There , we compete with fishermen from the Republic of Ireland , whereas the Northern Ireland fisherman for years has been subject to those draconian UK penalties . #% But the reality is something different . #% As the tragedy of abduction and murders of innocent young children continues to unfold here in Belgium and elsewhere , there is no-one who can not be other than deeply moved , disturbed and angry at what has been happening . #% We must continue to work towards this goal by amending FP7 . #% Every year over ECU 1 billion of taxpayers ' money is going to subsidize something which is detrimental to public health and which has a detrimental effect in countries around the world where there is no proper regulation to ensure that smokers are aware of the dangers of smoking . #% This is the second attempt at an EU landfill directive . #% Commissioner , we were very surprised to discover that you , a Commissioner with special responsibility for relations with Parliament , briefed the press in September before Parliament had even heard of these proposals . #% They have come up with only a unilateral solution and a narrow list . #% It would be wrong to oppose the directive because it does not give sufficient rights of information and consultation . #% I would also like to know whether there are wilderness areas that are currently not listed as Natura 2000 sites which would potentially come under the consideration of this report . #% We need strategies that look to the positive facet of that ageing population , to the experience that they have ; but also strategies that are realistic in seeing that people are being denied opportunities to access the new labour market . #% European initiatives to reduce the level of drug abuse in Europe must be supported at every opportunity . #% Emphasis is placed by Parliament on the need to respect the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and to protect against fears of bio-piracy in respect of the underdeveloped world and the environment , and these two are important obligations which can not be set aside . #% I should inform the House that Turkey is not a member of the European Union and therefore we are not in a position to dictate to them how they conduct their affairs or to share with them , in the way we might share with Member States , a pooling of consensus on the way we approach problems . #% Many others are offered introductions with a view to marriage . #% That is of vital importance . #% We should be very concerned that twice as many women as men suffer from dementia , and we should be very concerned that with an ageing European population , the number of sufferers will double in the next 20 years . #% Looking at the directive , as Mrs Lucas has said , the only thing we can do is impose a ban on this type of feeding of animals . #% The minutes of this House on Monday 3rd May 2004 exposed Mr Martin for the deceitful person that he is . #% I do not believe - and I have to disagree with my colleague - that an intervention shaped in this way will actually increase security . #% I would ask you , Commissioner , because the Commission has observers there , to give us accurate information on what is happening in relation to the numbers of abandoned babies . #% I was present at the House and I contributed to the debate on Northern Ireland . #% Amendment No 17 would impose additional obligations on Member States and would be difficult to implement . #% With the use of technologies like MRI and chemical screening , we now know that pornography alters children 's developing brains and stimulates the production of highly addictive brain chemicals . #% I am pleased that the communication is being debated so that the Member States and the public can learn more about the challenges involved . #% Little wonder that in their day-to-day lives so many citizens are questioning Europe 's ability to deliver the goods , because they know that action speaks louder than words . #% Along with your welcome to the new Northern Ireland Assembly Members , I wanted you to welcome them also . #% They did say earlier that they could not do that . #% The British decision to disrupt Community business is wrong . #% Mr President , as we have heard yet again today the Cardiff Summit has reiterated the foundations of EU foreign policy in Kosovo , which calls for the cessation of violence , a return to the negotiating table and engagement in a vigorous political process as the only solution to the Kosovo crisis . #% Regarding the issue of Christianity versus Islam there is a major problem . #% For many years these people have moved freely in Bosnia , despite the presence of SFOR troops and have remained free , despite the serious allegations made against them . #% I should like to ask you to take on board the views of those who know more about children in the developing world than perhaps you or I do , and who are concerned about the fact that we are perceived as a Union that concentrates more on large infrastructural projects than on children , and perhaps to think more deeply about the needs of children in terms of medical care and other assistance . #% The cornerstone of food safety policy is the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority . #% According to the mid-term evaluation on the spending of the Structural Funds in Ireland , carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute , over 30 , 000 jobs will be created in Ireland in the tourism sector between 1994 and 1999 . #% They left , it seems , as a result of ongoing problems of cross border fuel smuggling and laundering . #% When I started my insurance career a long time ago - practically 30 years ago - I remember the first week I was in the company , and the boss told me : ` The big challenge facing us is that we are going to have to deal with competition from Europe ! ' #% If this vote had been taken before the elections I am sure the vote would have been somewhat different . #% Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , three of them are fluorinated gases . #% The Commissioner told us at a recent briefing that he does not expect spectacular breakthroughs . #% The permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999 . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I would like to join with my colleagues in saying that today is a very sensitive occasion for us in Parliament . #% Secondly , the new disclosures requirements on lawyers , I believe , would seriously undermine the long established precedent of lawyer/client confidentiality . #% Today , the UK Chancellor is outlining drastic public sector cuts - cuts that the EU have urged Member States to make . #% All policies are interdependent and no economy should have a higher rate of dependency on any one energy source and no amount of increase or decrease in the interest rate can change that fact . #% Their best is to make money for their investors -- that is what corporations do -- and all the rest of their activities are part of this , be it a question of medical services , food or cars . #% Other matters will be dealt with in the fullness of time by the Italian electorate and presumably also the Italian courts . #% -- Mr President , I congratulate my colleague on this report . #% It is wonderful that the scientific committees on public health and animal health are meeting on a regular basis to update one other and exchange information on the outbreaks that have occurred close to the European Union 's borders . #% That is what I oppose . #% By now we should have found some alternative to it . #% The International Fund , as has been said here , has played a very positive role in the quest for a lasting and peaceful settlement to the Northern Ireland conflict . #% We all want clean water but the legislation we put in place must be adequate to achieve it . #% The last point that I would like to make is with regard to 3G . #% Remember that at the heart of all these issues there is fear , love and all too often , unfortunately , revenge . #% Madam President , a number of people have already raised issues relating to breaches of human rights and I also wish to raise a question of a serious breach of human rights . #% Indeed , I am of the view that the transatlantic relationship has not yet adapted fully to the new set of circumstances which exist following the collapse of the Iron Curtain , the effective removal of a security threat to Europe from the East and the emergence of the United States as the world 's only superpower . #% However , as far as the free movement of people is concerned , there has been little or no real progress to date in removing border restrictions . #% Some amendments will even have a perverse effect . #% More pressure is needed on China and Russia in particular to play a more positive role in Sudan . #% In addition , would it be possible to make displaying or advertising pre-tax prices along with post-tax prices obligatory ? #% Ireland , in particular Ireland South , has a rich cultural and creative history . #% 
The Cairo Conference and the Beijing Women 's Conference both stated the same thing . #% The key problem that I want to highlight today in connection with the Teverson report , in the light of the budgetary debate in 1997 and Council 's decision on 25th July to cut structural fund payments in some areas , is the perceived problem of under-utilization of structural funds . #% That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports . #% Prevention is in every way as crucial as reaction to natural disasters and I welcome the inclusion of the concept of prevention in the report . #% The internal market should not be a free-for-all for big business , leading to SMEs being squeezed out of markets with the result that consumers have less choice . #% I am quoting the author Mark Kurlansky in his book ` Cod : A Biography of the Fish that changed the World ' . #% That has been the case for centuries - and will continue . #% That is why I voted against the report : it is a really bad idea . #% If these councils are to play a meaningful role in the future , fishermen must be involved in all phases of the management process . #% It has been described as a ghost town ; it is desolate , isolated and empty . #% Nothing equates to the Nazi holocaust . #% There are alternatives and the only way we will achieve them is to impose a ban . #% This is a fallacy . #% . -- We are all excited at the way in which electronic communications and technology are put to use and their subsequent effects on our collective economies . #% That is not going to be easy by any means , in particular when one considers the levels of violence that we have all witnessed in the Middle East in recent times . #% It is a mistake for the Commission to propose that they should readjust the regulation to further exacerbate that particular problem . #% As she knows well , and as the United Nations has stated , the situation in Haiti is the worst humanitarian disaster in decades , as the numbers of missing people , victims and deaths continue to rise . #% To conclude , I repeat what I said to the Commission last July when the mid-term review proposals were made and again when the legislative proposals were made last month : the combined effects of the prospect of greatly liberalised agricultural trade under the WTO and the Commission proposals for major reform of the common agricultural policy are potentially devastating for European agriculture . #% His contribution was short and sweet but at this stage most of the talking has been done . #% I want to compliment Mrs Wallis on the preparation and the presentation of her report . #% The Finnish Government is certainly laying a great emphasis on the need to promote the enlargement process to a greater extent . #% We have to reinstate Parliament 's original position and the original Commission proposal . #% The establishment of an area of freedom , justice and security confers on members of the judiciary an essential role to play in the effective workings of the Union . #% We must ensure they are met . #% We can create thousands of much needed jobs and we can allow gas and electricity suppliers to make their money in a more sensible way by selling the services which energy gives us - warm homes , cool fridges and machines which work - rather than selling increasingly large amounts of gas and electricity . #% We must always remember that the diversity of Europe is its greatest strength . #% It would encourage us to drive more and larger cars at high speeds so that we use more fossil fuels , preferably with only one occupant in each car . #% My only words of caution are that we should not jump ahead of what the governments are willing to do , because ultimately the governments are the key representatives of their peoples and national interests . #% Events in Hong Kong after the hand-over in July later this year will be pivotal and revealing as to the role that mainland China intends to play in the region . #% Finally , who is regulating the regulators ? #% I welcome this programme , but it should not exclude smaller innovative projects which are deserving of support . #% The vast majority of the people of Gaza must rely on humanitarian aid for their very survival - food , water , shelter , clothes and , especially , medicine . #% I broadly welcome the Jové Peres report in its present form . #% That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government . #% It should have stood its ground and maintained solidarity . #% This kind of clarity can not be given on the basis of coexistence and promises of compensation after contamination : after contamination it is too late , it is no good to an organic farmer or to people who value their produce . #% A very important aspect , perhaps sometimes overlooked by this Parliament , is the obligation to come to the table with a real negotiating position and not just take a stance for the cameras . #% In no way does this over-bureaucratic and over-regulatory proposal appear to improve road safety records and therefore I consider it to be another unnecessary and unjustifiable piece of legislation . #% I ask people to reflect overnight and when we come tomorrow to vote in the light of the Commission 's opinion , to give to those charged to represent this House the widest , most thorough mandate possible to say : ` This is what is available ; this what we bring forward ; and this commands the support of a great majority of Parliament ' . #% It was quite clear yesterday in relation to another issue , Guantanamo , when Commissioner Patten said ` We can not do anything without the Council ' . #% Let these little children go to school unhindered . #% The overall objective of nearly all the amendments is undeniably dangerous . #% Most importantly and in conclusion , we must be ensured guaranteed compensation for any reduction in market support . #% Malta has a lot to gain if it manages to align itself more closely with EU membership rules . #% There is now great uncertainty from the perspective of regional airports across the length and breadth of the European Union with regard to how we are going to develop the low cost-airline industry in the future . #% The European Union has not been ignoring this worrying phenomenon . #% I had hoped that Commissioner McCreevy here today would have demonstrated that he had understood that message , but unfortunately his remarks with regard to services of general economic interest do not encourage me to believe that he has . #% Ireland has a lot to do in this particular area and anything that can help us to collect our minds and deliver -- as we must as a nation -- is to be welcomed . #% We must also endeavour to ensure full implementation of the directives . #% In the light of what has happened with the hushkits legislation I would like a response from the Commission . #% Let us support the bees . #% It is essential that individuals who are directly affected by breaches of environmental law have a means of redress , whether through an appeal body , the Ombudsman or , if necessary , through the courts . #% It is important to thrash out the rights of the host country and the obligations of the home country . #% However , the EU governments are seeking the conclusion of the more difficult chapters of talks between the applicant countries and the European Union before such a date can be announced . #% I know that many items which people want tackled are high on our agenda but they are not being dealt with at the IGC . #% It is a great honour for him and his family and , in particular , a great honour for Ireland to have a president of a group from Ireland . #% The majority want assurances that Ireland 's traditional military neutrality will be fully protected and respected by all Member States of the European Union . #% Mr President , last Friday Northern Ireland suffered the double blow of the loss of two factories , both the result of an inability to compete with cheap imports . #% The Union has also extended funding via the European Reconstruction Agency in Serbia to Montenegro as well as to propose an extension to the recently announced trade preferences of the Balkans and the whole of Yugoslavia . #% We can confiscate the financial proceeds of drug barons in Europe and we must be able to extend these powers of confiscation to other financial proceeds of crime . #% We need to get to the stage where blood tests for individual animals will stand up . #% We took the trouble to get an internal consensus in our group - it is a group position - and it is the position of the left in this House ; whereas Amendment No 5 ( paragraph 18 ) by Mr Arias Cañete is simply a personal amendment , supported by 29 signatures , and he does not have the backing of his own political group . #% The recommendations regarding warnings on the front of packages are to be welcomed because they shatter the myth that those products are less damaging to a person 's health . #% That is one of the things about the proposals for reform . #% Signs of Malta 's close ties with the EU are clearly evident on the island . #% As I said in Hong Kong and as I said in this House previously , my stance has been that this is a false impression . #% 
I have to declare a personal interest in this matter . #% I want better research and funding for Internet-tracing software . #% As the corollary decision to this decision taken by the EU leaders , the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy will be just that - a review of the CAP rather than a reform . #% I want to congratulate the British presidency . #% Is the President-in-Office aware of the continuing concern of people , in particular on Ireland 's east coast , about the safety of the accident-prone Sellafield plant ? #% I genuinely believe that the Commission proposals in this area would be disastrous if implemented . #% I hope , Commissioner , that you will ensure that it is not allowed to keep those slots in order to open up more lucrative routes and that if other companies are prepared to start up from the regions those slots will be given to them . #% Finally , we have to have the means to match our ambitions for our cohesion policies as Jacques Santer said . #% It also ignores the plans that are forging ahead on the Enfopol interception system in the EU . #% First , fishing vessels are built to fish , so fishing vessel owners are not going to be happy with their vessels sitting idle and losing money . #% It is with regret that colleagues on the right differed . #% Given this situation , would the Commissioner now ensure that some ground rules are laid down concerning the manufacture and sale of such toys ? #% Now is the time for this to happen . #% In the future , they will also alter the way in which we get our entertainment - whether through music , plays , television programmes , films or books . #% We also have to address the use of industrial fishing to feed aquaculture . #% Any assistance that Europe can offer to kick-start the industry is very positive . #% My last point is that this House must be seen around Europe as a House to be treated with respect and honour , because we have a mandate and we bring the voice of the people as close as possible to the heart of what the European Union is . #% Lastly , at a time when we rightly seek to inform people of the dangers of tobacco and to reduce tobacco use , it seems illogical to me that we would seek to legislate for the liberalisation of drugs . #% If you want public acceptance - and many of you do - of the nuclear industry , you have to ensure that . #% I would ask Commissioner Flynn to join with me in urging the Irish Government to coordinate its efforts with the efforts being made here in Europe . #% This register would simply give information to those seeking to employ people in the form of a ` yes ' or ` no ' about a previous conviction . #% European governments and the EU institutions must now focus their attention on promoting health education in schools in the area of making young people aware of the dangers of smoking . #% I hope that the US President will come up with a firm proposal to outline how his administration intends to reduce the level of greenhouse gases in the immediate future . #% As Ban Ki-moon said in Rome , at a time when the global population is growing and our global climate is changing , by 2050 , we will need to produce 70 % more food , yet the weather is becoming more extreme and unpredictable . #% In the last programming period 9 % of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives . #% I know it is an important issue for President Barroso and for others to try to move away from unanimity where it is not possible to get it , but if you do that you further alienate not only governments , but the people as well : people who see Europe as an autocratic body trying to force its own will on others . #% The mistake was not that the Pact was there , but that it was not enforced against other countries that continue to breach those guidelines and fail to observe the overall policies on the proper management and operation of economies and fiscal policies . #% I should be very grateful if the Commissioner could tell me who is or was responsible for drafting the Commission 's management plan . #% We have a moral obligation to support the effort of finding the way to provide urgently needed medicines to people in developing countries . #% We have a responsibility as parliamentarians to avoid extreme language and extreme solutions . #% At home they say one thing and out here they do something very different . #% We might benefit in the heavily populated urban areas , the normally profitable areas , but at a very great cost to the non-urban areas . #% in writing . - Dear colleagues , I rise today in appreciation of the work of our ombudsman , Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros . #% Nevertheless , I agree with Mrs Fraga on the whole matter of whether or not it is right to charge the fishermen for the privilege of fishing . #% Most reforms start off as good intentions but can lose their original purpose in Parliament through amendments . #% I might say that I associate myself entirely with the remarks made by my colleague , Mr Nicholson , and no doubt if Mr Hume were here he would be saying the same thing . #% Many citizens will not accept this as the constitution of the EU and if referenda are held , as they must be in some states , I believe there will be no majority for a constitution promoting nuclear technology . #% There is state-sponsored terrorism and terrorism of war and retribution , as we are witnessing in the Middle East . #% The fact that the President-in-Office is red-haired does not in any way mean we should compare him to Red Rum who was one of the best stayers on the Grand National course . #% Even in the US , where only 8 % of websites have trustmarks , there are still considerable problems gaining legal redress . #% No one campaigned against enlargement on the `` no '' side . #% Mr President , congratulations to Mr Marset Campos , not least for his patience and persistence with this report . #% The Commission 's scientific committee on animal health and animal welfare concluded that levels of animal welfare drop as journey times increase . #% We should strive for the best possible Utopian ideal and work towards that . #% the status of religious organisations and #% After the IGC conference there will be a wide-ranging public debate in each of the 15 EU countries and in some cases a referendum before the ratification process can be completed . #% We all recall the devaluations which took place in 1992 , when the international currency speculators played havoc with the European stock markets . #% The cruelty of the sentence , and the fact that she had given birth one month before , makes it very difficult for us to accept any assurances from the government of Nigeria that they are protecting the civil rights of their people and their own population . #% I would also like to express my great regret that six years after those heinous crimes were exposed , this man has still not been brought to justice . #% Two per cent of the current EU research budget for the entire agricultural sector does not facilitate the achievement of this objective . #% It is extremely important that the European Union is perceived by our citizens as more than an economic exercise and a free market because that , without any doubt , will alienate them further from the notion of European integration . #% She said you can not expect her to condemn human rights abuses in other parts of the world and let the United Nations itself be responsible for what is happening in Iraq following the sanctions . #% Roisín McAliskey is being kept in a Category A gaol without adequate medical care . #% Secondly , the whole question of how one disposes of nuclear waste . #% We should all be aware that this report came about , to a large extent , as a result of the aeroplanes flying into the Twin Towers in New York in September 2001 . #% Facts please , Taoiseach , specifics please , no more wish lists , because this is the eighth time I have sat here listening to this at the start of a presidency and I find it very hard at the end of every presidency to see what difference has actually been made in relation to the Lisbon Strategy . #% I regret that the Convention avoided this issue , and particularly regret that the delegate from the Verts/ALE Group , Johannes Voggenhuber , neglected to make progress on it , being drawn instead by a grand design for a new constitution . #% Of the three topics we are discussing , this is by far the worst and probably the most recurring , as speakers have said . #% It is basically in the interests of the militarisation of Europe , which is not in the interests of people in the long term . #% The recent hearing on farm income must surely have alerted all of us to the challenges facing EU farmers . #% I think it would be a grave error to start labelling organisations here as one religion or another . #% Decision-making procedures must change so that we can guarantee that decisions can be taken within the different EU institutions in a streamlined and structured manner . #% In 1999 , 41,000 images were seized and one recent conviction revealed a man with over 50,000 images of child abuse . #% I believe that the promise of solving illnesses , increasing yield and cleaning up the environment etc remain to be proven . #% This Costa report , despite its plausible verbiage , is part of that process of harmonisation aimed at creating a single criminal justice system . #% The Irish electorate are making it clear that they will not be patronised or taken for granted by the political leaders and governments of the Member States , or by Brussels . #% 
I have no difficulty whatsoever with the need to develop the fishing ports that are , in many ways , hard-pressed through restructuring and depleted stocks . #% in writing . - The European Police College ( CEPOL ) , which became an agency in 2006 , has faced severe problems since its creation in abiding by minimum good administration norms to which all EU agencies are submitted . #% Suddenly we discover that even more demands are being made on the European agricultural sector . #% The people of Ireland have been totally forthright in their opposition to the existence and expansion of nuclear operations at Sellafield . #% Washington 's claims are based on Al Qaida prisoners in Guantanamo Bay . #% Undoubtedly , substantial progress has been made in increasing the independence , transparency and efficiency of public administrations in the applicant countries , as well as in improving the operation of their legal systems . #% It should be put on record , and I want to put it on record today . #% Colleagues will remember that , some weeks ago in the European Parliament building in Brussels , the President of Parliament invited a number of Nobel Prize winners to speak on the future of Europe and on areas and issues that they are concerned with . #% I am very pleased that research is being carried out with regard to the concern about toys . #% But above and beyond that it is recognised that you are a man of strong conviction with many natural human qualities ; a person of great energy and determination and a person who has always been positive and even-handed ; a person who is encouraging and indeed , a person who can be very firm and authoritative when that sort of authority needs to be shown , as we have witnessed on occasion . #% It is a new and low threshold in the tide of human affairs . #% I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment . #% I therefore welcome this report , which should go some way to tackling this problem . #% Mr President , I also come from an island which had suffered almost 30 years of terrorism . #% To justify this by saying that we label them is completely ridiculous . #% Such an environment does not cultivate consumer confidence , domestic demand or domestic growth . #% Now it actually used the money it was getting from these interest payments on land that they were purchasing . #% We can all take solace from the fact that the key protagonists in this difficult political equation are now addressing the most vexed and thorny bottom line issues that have to be resolved if a permanent peace agreement is to be put in place in the Middle East . #% I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe , we will make progress on the economic front , on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy , but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand . #% The Reverend Quang and his associates have been relentlessly hounded by the Communist authorities . #% Finally , could I say that if we are to guarantee the success of these measures then it must be done on a tripartite basis with national , local and European involvement . #% I agree with the Commission proposal as to the scope of the Directive . #% They can not afford childcare or care for elderly parents . #% In particular , I congratulate my colleague , the rapporteur , Mr Florenz , on the passion he has sustained on this issue , despite all the various problems he faced from industry and the different political groups in this House , not least his own group . #% That brings us to the question of what their best is . #% The reality is that social Europe has been very much a ` frill ' or an ` add-on ' to the broader game plan of this Union . #% We need to enable Europe , which is lagging behind in e-commerce and Internet business worldwide , to put in place new arrangements with regard to creation of on-line business and the protection of consumer rights and also to ensure that Europe takes its rightful place at the top of the world trading system of Internet and on-line businesses . #% It is quite clear that in Vietnam that is not the situation . #% In this area the market has failed , as it so often does , and there has been , until now , a certain lack of public leadership , with a particular bottleneck in the clinical trials aspect of finding new products . #% We should ensure that where we are protecting services or markets we do not oblige other countries which are less able to do battle in the open market to start up services that will simply sink or become private monopolies owned outside their own state . #% Since the introduction of standards which can be specified in legislation , as done in the UK pet statute , all ISO standard readers can read all ISO standard microchips . #% In Yugoslavia , Slobodan Milosevic still remains in situ in former Yugoslavia and he has much to answer for . #% What I said in the newspaper was that , unless these investigations were carried out , the public were going to assume that there was corruption going on , and we have a duty in this House to get things investigated . #% In my country , the Republic of Ireland , in eight days time , there is a referendum on the Treaty of Nice , unique among the 15 Member States . #% It is high time we stopped paying lip service to working mothers , their children and their families in our European Community . #% Could you do what you can to ensure those amendments are made available in the different languages this afternoon . #% The criteria for inclusion on the EMAS register are very stringent . #% Some 30 000 people per year in western Europe , North America , Japan and Australia die from asbestos exposure . #% Mr President , when we talk about human rights abuses around the world we have to look to ourselves and see what we are responsible for . #% In this regard , would the Commissioner agree that access by women to the workplace -- which is greatly restricted in the EU compared to the situation in the US , in part because of the lack of affordable childcare facilities -- needs to be addressed ? #% in writing . - I support this report , which calls for the EU to promote the introduction of a financial transaction tax ( FTT ) at global level , and failing that , as a first step , the EU should implement an FTT at European level . #% The anti-war movement has warned of these problems since the start of the war . #% Thank you for your reply and for your commitment to transparency . #% The agri-dairy sector is as crucial to Ireland 's farmers as cocoa is to other producing countries , and I have no desire to minimize the importance of cocoa to the countries which are dependent on it . #% Finally , I call on the Cologne European Council to take the decision to begin negotiations on Malta 's accession by the end of this year . #% World Bank researchers predict that , in 2010 alone , 64 million more people will be plunged into extreme poverty by the crisis and that because of it , in 2009 , between 30 000 and 50 000 children have already died in Africa of malnutrition . #% The continuation of the LFA scheme is vital if we are to compensate farmers for providing public goods , avoiding land abandonment , assisting in promoting biodiversity and helping to support rural communities . #% Mrs Lenz 's proposals will do something to improve that situation . #% Business-to-consumer communications are particularly important for the elderly , the housebound and for those with family responsibilities who are finding it difficult to juggle work and career , overwhelmingly women . #% This will mean , for instance , that in the road transport area there will be three categories of operators : own-account , third party hauliers and self-employed . #% There has been almost a complete breakdown in the implementation of the roadmap for peace in the region . #% A single European market should be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat . #% While I recognise that this is substantially less than the 40 000 that were there until the late 1990s , the Lebanese people clearly want the Syrian troops out of their country . #% Our reaction must be to do all that we can to prevent the sort of widespread slaughter , injury and chaos we saw in the United States . #% In that context perhaps the institutional arrangements need to be examined . #% Just as in the hate campaign against gays in Uganda , the homophobic campaign in Lithuania tries to insinuate that gay people pose a threat to children , implying sexual abuse of children . #% Finally , I want to quote the cases of SOLVIT , which I believe is an excellent initiative of the Commission . #% The only reason there were so many children going to the school was because they were given food donated by the European Union and the World Food Programme . #% Your own country , like California , has recently suffered major power cuts following liberalisation . #% I thank all those who spent a lot of time and effort in getting to this position . #% Sadly and shamefully , the head of state of an EU member country -- President McAleese of the Republic of Ireland -- chose that 60th anniversary to launch a vicious and vindictive attack on the majority community in Northern Ireland when she shamefully equated Nazi hatred of Jews to the attitude of Protestants towards Roman Catholics . #% Every single job lost in the European aviation industry as a result of the Commission 's decision , will create an ever-widening pool of resentment towards Europe , not towards national governments which may be pursuing their own agendas . #% It is a fact that today , our farmers are faced with overwhelming obstacles when it comes to achieving a fair price for their produce . #% Measures must be implemented to raise more from this sector and contribute to shifting the burden of taxation away from working people . #% This would be in total violation of the concepts of human dignity and the right to life as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% This has negative consequences also for urban areas . #% 
The next step will be to extend the joint register to all the EU institutions and to convince the Commission and Council to make it mandatory . #% On these issues , there has been no rapprochement . #% I also believe that the European Union could do a lot more . #% When it comes to protecting the borders of the European Union , a common approach is needed at EU level . #% The island of Ireland has been growing more rapidly than any other part of the developed world in the past 18 months during this peace process and the fruit was only beginning to ripen . #% Not only did you do this on time , as promised , but you also came forward with a 140-page document which , unlike the present Treaty , can be easily read by ordinary citizens and , most importantly , they can make sense of it on that first reading . #% There is tremendous enthusiasm for all types of renewable energy . #% Madam President , the views of the 370 million citizens of the European Union on the food chain in Europe have dramatically changed in recent years . #% People want more Europe in certain areas , but if you tell people in the world , or people in Europe , or people in my country , that they will be part of a European army ; that their taxes will be determined by Brussels ; that they will have no say with regard to what kind of a police force they will have , they will reject it out of hand . #% It is not as binding or as transparent as legislation , and there is a real lack of confidence expressed by the pedestrian protection bodies . #% The new DCI will , for the first time , enshrine in a legal text the internationally accepted definition of development policy set out by the OECD Development Assistance Committee . #% We should oppose it at every opportunity rather than saying : just keep us informed about it . #% It is a highly destructive proposal , which could put at risk the effectiveness and even the very existence of the European Union . #% But I can say that there is regular dialogue with these states and the European Union . #% I have nothing in principle against the implementation of voluntary codes of practice for European Union airlines . #% Firstly , do we know how many missing children there are in the enlarged European Union ? #% He is so isolated he probably will never hear of the debate here today . #% Madam President , I wish to thank the rapporteurs for these reports on measures intended to promote observance of human rights . #% It is because we are not as committed to this problem as we should be . #% Every year in the United States , with a population less than the European Union , they deal with the disappearance of approximately 367 , 000 children , I repeat 367 , 000 . #% Madam President , I would like to add my voice to those who are calling for an emergency debate on the escalating crisis with regard to foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain . #% Politics is important because it affects people 's lives . #% The revolutions there demonstrate that a risen working class and the risen poor are more powerful than even the most brutal repressive methods , the most repressive regimes . #% In the vote I would like to see the proposal to include beer extended to include cider also . #% We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements , but we would like to see more . #% That is an important thing to recognise because in my area farmers feel very secure because of the very low instances we have of BSE and because of the strict controls that we have monitored and made sure worked over recent years . #% Delays in this area are leading to confusion on the part of consumers and may well be depriving European agriculture of the tools necessary for sustainability , quality and competitiveness . #% The motorway , as currently planned , will bury this site before an archaeological dig has been carried out . #% Firstly , with regard to raising the limits on when tenders have to be put out for consultation , looking for the 50 % increase is important because it has already been proven that the present limits do not allow for greater cross-border interaction between companies and between companies and agencies . #% I am pro-American , but that does not mean that I am not going to question the US Government for the presumed use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation , illegal detention and/or torture of prisoners . #% It is essential that we find a means of ensuring the reality of free movement of goods throughout the EU without prejudice to those who earn their living from inter-Community trade . #% The IND/DEM Group was simply skipped . #% Mr President , currently there is a very expensive advertising campaign on US television in which people like the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation tell lies . #% They want a Europe that is based on human values , based firmly on universal rights . #% Member States need to stand up and take responsibility for their respective infrastructures . #% Mr President , we have to recognise that the relationship between the European Union and the United States is at an all-time low . #% I therefore hope that our suggestion will ensure that we are able to have both openness and good management of each individual part of the programmes . #% The government is presently formulating its national development plan outlining our social and economic investment priorities for the years 2000-2006 . #% There is clearly a very serious problem , and Aung San Suu Kyi should be released immediately . #% I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and all the political groups for a wide-ranging discussion and debates . #% The resolution also tries to deal with the more sensitive issue of involvement by Western , and specifically US and European , technology and companies in providing the capacity for certain governments to censor and filter Internet material . #% I have already asked this and you have not seen fit to deliver . #% I can assure the Commission and the Council presidency that we will use these powers rigorously in the future . #% I have a report here by Parliament , from the STOA committee . #% With regard to Iran , EU leaders had expressed the hope that engaging Iran in political dialogue would strengthen reformist elements and improve human rights . #% I believe in containment and recovery as very sensible and effective means of mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases . #% I am an Irish Member of this Parliament and we in Ireland know how terrorism builds and grows and how , by making the wrong decisions , governments can strengthen terrorist organisations . #% However , splitting hairs over decimal points on the budget last weekend has put Europe 's ambitious Seventh Framework Programme for doubling funding on research on ice . #% I would like to welcome the Commission 's initiative to urge Member States to introduce best practice with regard to breast-cancer screening . #% Northern Ireland is an Objective 1 area but this will possibly come to an end . #% The interim report before us today points to the undeniable fact that rendition flights have taken place in Europe . #% I have closely reviewed the discussions and debates on how best to achieve this and I can support the Commission 's proposal regarding the SPC extension , in tandem with the review mechanism proposed in the Regulation . #% Unfortunately , we seem to be no closer to resolving this murder . #% Not a lot has happened since in one sense . #% It looked as if that might happen , so I welcome the funding for health and complementary medicine . #% It was subsequently that the European Union extended it to 200 miles . #% The report deals with 70 different countries and eight thematic issues . #% I believe that one of the neglected parts of the Lisbon agenda is greater social cohesion , which the IDA Programme will contribute to greatly , as well as , of course , the knowledge-based economy . #% Finally , I would like to say to the Commission that I do not honestly see the logic behind this . #% Indeed , if we use the analogy of what happened with the European Company Statute , the legal basis is different despite the fact that there are similarities between the two proposals put forward . #% I also ask you to appeal to the Irish and British Governments to use whatever intermediaries they have with the IRA to seek more precise information about the location of those five unfortunate victims of IRA terror . #% I am totally against EU interference in regulating national taxes . #% I have seen much excellent research funded by European grants , both in collaborative projects with industry and across borders , and in individual grants to expert scientists . #% I very much welcome the response of the President-in-office and I am sure he is aware of the scale of this problem . #% These questions must be fully explored and a watching brief should be maintained by the Parliament in relation to these developments and trends in media ownership in Ireland and across the EU . #% Ulster beef , which all Europeans will soon be able to savour again when the beef ban is lifted , has a taste and quality which makes it renowned and which caused the Greenfield label to be synonymous with the highest quality . #% 
Pesticides play an important role in these elements demanded by European consumers . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to begin by congratulating Chancellor Klima and Mr Schüssel on completing the first ever Austrian presidency . #% It has taken nine years to get this legislation . #% My last point concerning the qualitative selection criteria . #% This solidarity is something we must inject into this debate , as Europeans , with greater vigour and not simply leave it to local or national interests to make the case . #% I welcome what the Commissioner has said but I should like him to remember especially those parts of the Union that are on the periphery such as Northern Ireland . #% There probably is a problem in interpretation here . #% He will know the critical tone of Parliament 's resolution on the broad guidelines last month . #% This principle in essence means that safety and health must be put before any conflicting scientific evidence , and I fully support the previous speakers who again referred to the importance of applying the precautionary principle . #% Since trade policy was foolishly handed over to the exclusive competence of the EU , the plain truth is that Member States are powerless to act in the face of cheap imports ravaging their textile industry . #% Could you confirm this and , indeed , could Parliament ' s presidency confirm that there is no problem with asbestosis which , of course , would be in breach of our own EU directive passed over a decade ago . #% It is quite possible also that in an open method of coordination , the national parliaments would also have transmitted to them the proposals which are coming before this Parliament and other institutions . #% The fact that the governments have so far failed to reach agreement on this is unacceptable to everyone . #% What issues has the Commission identified in this important debate and how does it intend to promote discussion on them in the future ? #% If more countries were willing to do this , then we would not have the same sense of urgency or danger that now faces many pensioners in Europe today . #% The ordinary people of Colombia live and suffer in an environment of oppression caused not only by these paramilitary and guerrilla groups , but often at the hands of a government which is either unwilling or unable to protect them . #% I would have hoped that there would be global recognition at this stage that the CCCTB proposal is badly thought out and ill-advised . #% We must use our influence how and when we can . #% Why are we having this ? #% I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation . #% There were many important points put directly to Commissioner Figel ' ; I should be delighted if he would respond to them . #% But , most of all , we stand today in our common bond of humanity as our American friends bravely search for their survivors and for their dead . #% They did not know the source of the bubonic menace and were unable to halt it in its deadly tracks . #% I would like to put on record my reasons for voting against certain sections of Mr Färm 's report today , in particular those paragraphs dealing with agriculture . #% Such an assessment should also be evaluated by the European Commission . #% The report therefore calls for a rejection of the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain . #% author . - Mr President , I welcome the attention drawn to the appalling and consistent crushing of human rights in Azerbaijan : no freedom for the media , dozens of journalists jailed , some beaten , some even killed in recent years . #% I have had several meetings with junior doctors in Ireland over the last number of months with regard to this issue . #% That is why , President-in-Office , the ideas being proposed on improving justice and home affairs , promoting alternative energy -- although I might disagree with you on other aspects of climate change and their solutions -- and new ways of creating biofuels , bio-energy and bioethanol are the way forward . #% The European Coal and Steel Community has served energy well and the Euratom Treaty , although anachronistic and definitely a 1957 Treaty , has been a very powerful impetus to one form of energy - nuclear energy . #% That was a mistake and it is to be hoped that there will now be a retreat from that position . #% Productivity-enhancing policies , particularly those in green energy and research and development , must be recognised as the driver of the EU 's economic future . #% We are all aware that the agri-sector is beset by low margins , and the least , I think , that EU farmers can expect is that the cost of inputs should not be increased by the failure of the EU to act sufficiently quickly to establish authorisations . #% Therefore , raising awareness , changing attitudes and , above all , exchanging best practice is an enormous contribution we can make here to this most important area . #% in writing . - I was eager for European citizens to benefit from this powerful instrument as soon as possible , and I am delighted to see the end of the legislative procedure one year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon . #% If we carry on with the Commission 's GM coexistence policy , organic farms will inevitably be contaminated . #% The EU is the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to the Afghan people . #% We are witnessing in the 21st century the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution . #% This is not what we are going to get out of the IGC if things continue as they are . #% I would hope that Members of the House would not attribute to me things that I did not say . #% Since the Veronica is now a flag-of-convenience vessel , what is the Commission doing to stop the Veronica from offloading in Las Palmas ? #% There are lots of opportunities here . #% It seems to me that the biggest sin we have committed in our country is to reward the people with tax cuts and increases in salary . #% It is easy to understand their frustration as they see their purchasing power eroded and their general quality of life under attack on many fronts . #% The implementation date of 2010 gives both sides of industry time to negotiate new agreements that take account of the 48-hour week . #% Fortunately , this is not having any significant impact on the attitude of Irish voters to the Treaty of Nice . #% The beef ban for Northern Ireland is unjust and should be lifted immediately . #% Aquaculture and agriculture are totally different sectors that must be addressed separately . #% I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency . #% In these circumstances , it is a matter for the government of Spain to judge whether such incidents indicate a deliberate breach of the ETA ceasefire and to act accordingly . #% We have to try and deal with the hopelessness that motivates them . #% But all those children who have died are not . #% In particular , the European Union shall adopt measures setting out the highest standards for the quality and safety of organs and substances of human origin , blood and blood derivatives . #% We must ensure that measures are both environment - and family-friendly . #% I believe that this new single EU-wide credit card format will also go a long way in combating driving licence tourism . #% Commissioner , what is the value of a territorial pact without social partners and are we going to accept recycled projects that are not in the spirit of the confidence pact ? #% I also believe that as a short-term measure and for the purpose of dealing with the build-up of animals due to the market collapse , beef heifers should be included with steers as being eligible for compensation . #% That resulted in absolutely no downward pressure to reduce emissions and in a very volatile carbon credit market . #% I am not taking a belligerent approach with regard to the operation of EMU criteria , but we can not allow the situation to go on forever where countries are running up large budget deficits and are clearly in breach of so-called strict rules governing the operation of the single currency regime . #% I would like to hear the views of the Portuguese presidency , and maybe other presidencies , when others coming from the extreme right or indeed the extreme left enter government within the Union . #% I am pleased to see our new Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio . #% First of all , I assume the solidarity fund is a general fund . #% I welcome the fact that the newly established European Food Safety Authority will play a key role in assessing applications for authorisation . #% Certain clear targets have already been set by the Union in the energy field to reduce CO2 emissions by 8 % by the middle of the next decade and of course to double the contribution of renewable energy sources from the current 6 % to 12 % by 2010 . #% But having said this , as parliamentarians , we should exercise fully and vigilantly our right to scrutinise the outcomes of comitology meetings and to hold the Commission to account when their standing committee experts ' decisions exceed the powers conferred on them by the TSE regulation . #% Now that the war in Iraq has ended , the emphasis shifts to rebuilding and reconstruction . #% 
It is clear that we will experience a drastic drop in the number of young farmers over the next couple of decades , unless appropriate and effective measures are put in place now . #% I therefore dissociate myself , on behalf of the victims in my country , from the eulogy to a confederate of world terrorism . #% We should welcome Romania and Bulgaria , congratulate their officials , their governments and their people for what they have achieved so far , remember the horrors that they have come through and look forward to the bright future that lies ahead for them and for us . #% In order to achieve these goals I feel that the budget must be at least maintained , and I want to thank the rapporteur for a very good report and his cooperation . #% Anyone or any Government who objects to this now will have some serious questions to answer to the European citizen . #% Ireland enjoys a relatively sophisticated mortgage credit market in EU terms , including access to the full range of competitively priced mortgage products . #% It was to be ` electricity too cheap to meter ' . #% However it must be remembered that the attempt to establish common norms regarding safe country , and the concept of safe country of origin , in general is restrictive and could be used and abused by member states . #% There is a welcome to them here in the European Parliament . #% The only way that can be done is by taking them out of the area of conflict and bringing them into dialogue , giving them the support and the strength and the backbone that they need , not only to convince themselves that peace is achievable and that harmony can be achieved between the peoples of Israel and Palestine , but also that they will be given full support from the European Union and each of its Member States to achieve that . #% But we have run into difficulties on the THERMIE project and indeed , on SYNERGIE as well because of the lack of a legal base ; and because - as has been said here today - we really do not have a common energy policy or even a working energy policy that we are harmonizing . #% We need to try to get the maximum amount of action to encourage an end to this bloodshed and violence . #% This matter should be left to the Member States because otherwise , as has already been seen , there would be differences in implementation of the penalties . #% We must use the powers we have to force Member State governments to convene another IGC and rectify the failures of Amsterdam . #% I can confirm that the Council recently received a Commission proposal for a set of measures in the beef sector on which the European Parliament has been consulted . #% Perhaps the wording is not as bad as it was originally . #% We must work incessantly to convince our own consumers and customers in exports markets that our beef is safe and wholesome . #% We will have failed them unless we tackle racism and xenophobia in the European Union . #% The government of Mauritania has full discretion regarding the use to which the financial compensation element is put . #% A peaceful and stable Afghanistan is an important bulwark against the resurgence of extremism in the region . #% It is very timely , therefore , that this summit will be addressing key environmental issues which need to be tackled , both within the Union and in a more global context . #% We know where we stand ; we have recorded votes on the basic principles of the budget vote , and it would be helpful if we avoided trying to replicate something about which we have , in substance , already reached a decision . #% If they feel that the EU or government does not seem to be working for them , they always have the office of the Ombudsman to turn to , to seek redress . #% We have a big task ahead of us , but I would like to take this opportunity to remind all the signatories of the Hague convention that they signed up not just to protect their own nationals who may become victims of child abduction , but also to use the convention to assist those who are victims of child abduction by their own nationals . #% As well as the ethical question of mass-medicating members of the public , who do not want fluoridation in their tap water , could you comment on the ethical and infant-related issues ? #% It is appropriate that we are having this debate as a joint debate with the Casaca report , because the whole issue of fishery control measures and what is required is one that not only can deliver more environmentally and economically sustainable fisheries ; it can also give certainty to many fishing families , so that they can continue to live their lives in the way that they have enjoyed up to now . #% Getting it right is so important . #% For some of them , victims of racism , action can not come quick enough and PPE pleading on respecting parliamentary procedure , I am afraid , will fall on deaf ears in my region ' s organisations . #% This is something that must be a priority for the EU , we can not allow arms to be sent to countries where they are causing such massive human rights abuses . #% It is also essential that an agreement should be negotiated and signed between the European Union and the United States , stipulating that each party should observe the provisions governing protection of the privacy of citizens and the confidentiality of business communications . #% The two biggest issues around the Constitutional Treaty are firstly , that 60 million Europeans died in the first half of the last century because we did not have an integrated Europe and secondly , not only governments and parliaments but civil society were involved in the formation of this Constitutional Treaty . #% They are not the result of the 1992 reform but due to unpredictable circumstances which include BSE , the collapse of the Russian economy and , in some cases , the renationalisation of food markets . #% This is a deal-breaker for us . #% Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently . #% Disclosing exact percentages for animal feedingstuffs goes beyond the equivalent provisions applicable to food for human consumption . #% My group was also able to support the agreement in trialogue and I think it has found a good compromise . #% They are being damaged for life . #% By coincidence , the Commission came forward today with a working document on the performance of industries providing services of general economic interest , and this also covered telecoms . #% It basically promotes the whole idea of a fortress Europe , keeping out the so-called undesirables , whereas we should be looking at why people are seeking asylum , not victimising them . #% The final point that I would make is that we must move to a system where there is a flat rate for access to information technology and not allow internal competition to arise which will block the further expansion of this new global system . #% Since the number of people who reach old age is increasing , the absolute number of suicides is expected to rise . #% We can not continue to allow our children to be destroyed in this way by the drug underworld . #% Mr President , I had great pleasure in voting for this particular report , because the report confirms that food security is a basic human right . #% The discussion is now taking place . #% We are a continent that is sending USD 2 billion worth of weapons to drought-stricken Ethiopia and we can not find a couple of helicopters to send urgently to save people drowning in Mozambique . #% Let us all remember , as was said by previous speakers , that the alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy . #% I remain deeply concerned that the United States continues to choose to tackle the climate change issue through unilateral activities . #% However , if I may be so bold , I would like to touch on two or three elements . #% I would also repeat that all Members are entitled to request a filter for their system if they are being annoyed by these e-mails , which will then be removed . #% I would much rather be talking about problems of conflict of interest in relation to the Commissioner-designate for Competition , or ineptitude in relation to the Commissioner-designate for Energy . #% The proposals will also lead to a conflict with other goals with regard to the regulation of traffic to reduce congestion and other impacts . #% On the same report about these reforms we heard the President of Guyana , the chairman of the Jamaican sugar industry and the chairman of the Mozambique sugar industry saying what a disaster these reforms would be for those countries . #% I welcome the amendments tabled by Mr Ford and Mr Swoboda , which strengthen the resolution . #% I would appreciate the fact if my name could be included among those who were present . #% Mr President , I rise on the same issue . #% I give my group 's official position first , after which I will make a couple of points myself as the President 's mediator for transnationally abducted children . #% As far as I am concerned this is money laundering : the illegal transfer of money not belonging to Gama to another bank in the Netherlands and subsequently to another bank . #% Therefore the onus is on us to ensure that we can put in place proper controls and measures , not with regard to access , but ensuring that parents can make certain their children will not be endangered by these new technologies and also that there is cooperation amongst the law enforcement agencies across the Member States . #% The support we are offering today is essential . #% Body scanners are not infallible but they are the best technology available at present and so we need to use what tools we have to hand in order to reduce the terrorist threat . #% I would suggest the same thing should happen for taxpayers contributing to the EU 's budget . #% Labelling must be accurate and checked to ensure consumer confidence . #% I believe that a balanced view of the decline of the bee population must be taken into consideration , not just blaming farming practices but investing in investigation into diseases and ways of minimising their impact . #% After all , when we are talking about vaccination , we talk about cattle only , but it was the transport of sheep in the UK , Ireland , France and elsewhere that actually spread the disease the last time , and we must not lose sight of that . #% Let us hope that they make these decisions in the same spirit of openness and accountability and respect for democracy that they rightly demand of the Commission . #% This House and the Commission have a huge responsibility to get the balance right . #% 
Is it possible to look at competencies , the role of national parliaments and the role of the charter and not change the content of the Treaty ? #% We have to be sure that any changes which are brought about within the European Union in the future command the goodwill and support of the citizens of the Union . #% I am sure you can imagine , Commissioner , our astonishment and dismay when the Commission abandoned this programme in the year 2000 , cancelled a call for tenders already published , causing huge inconvenience , and proceeded to spend no money at all throughout the year 2000 . #% These issues need debating and both consumers and public are right to be cautious . #% This institution will work very closely with the Spanish and Danish presidencies of the Union to ensure that enlargement negotiations are a success . #% That has left us with a serious legacy of decay and decline with out-of-date structures and over-capacity in our water and sewage works . #% Several times in this House I have protested about this totally unacceptable invasion of our system , which has no place here and is causing serious problems for Members . #% Mr President , I wish to join with other Members in congratulating the rapporteur , and I would also like to acknowledge the valuable work undertaken by Mrs Agnes Schierhuber , our own rapporteur in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . #% in writing . - The approval of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent , Deter and Eliminate Illegal , Unreported and Unregulated Fishing ( the Agreement ) is to be welcomed . #% Could I put it simply for them , because it seems to be very difficult for them to understand : do they argue that the World Cup should be lost because the first team that plays should lose if it does not score the first goal , or should the game go its full term and should every qualified team play the complete game to the end ? #% It is right and proper to condemn and continue to condemn the atrocity of 11 September 2001 and all other atrocities engineered by terrorists , whether in the United States or in Europe , in Spain , Ireland or indeed in Israel or the Palestinian territories . #% Mr President , I would like to begin my brief contribution by again thanking Commissioner Fischler for his openness and frankness from the very moment that this very serious matter arose . #% I know that Mr Titley is a lobbyist for what I would call ` the merchants of death ' . #% The black economy is thriving in Europe in the services sector because these complex and costly barriers are encouraging businesses to engage in undeclared and illegal work . #% The golden toad is the most memorable of these species , although probably not the most deserving . #% I have time only to refer to abuses of religious freedom . #% I welcome the Commission 's support for an interest rate reduction as stated by Commissioner Rehn . #% It is not enough to talk about the need to ensure that developing countries have sufficient resources to feed and to provide for their own people . #% Turkey 's membership , even wider enlargement and the Constitution are all part of the same grand design . #% Can you say who is blocking the multinational force which would be prepared to move into the region as a matter of urgency , as you suggested ? #% That violence includes a Palestinian suicide bomb attack on a bus in Jerusalem and a number of Israeli attacks on members of Hamas carried out in densely populated civilian areas . #% However , UK fishermen 's experience of the common fisheries policy , whatever the Conservative Party might now say , has been so negative that , in consequence and in conscience , I could not advocate what amounts to the full extension of the common fisheries policy controls to the inshore sector . #% My question , Question No 8 , also deals with xenophobia . #% In the context of the proposed revision or review of the early farm retirement scheme , I put it to the President-in-Office that perhaps he should consider making it possible for retiring farmers not to have to opt out totally , but to remain in partial employment , because even from a psychological point of view that is extremely important . #% From an administrative point of view the formalisation is a good thing . #% As part of our oversight role , we must insist that policy continuously focus on the achievement of the MDGs , which aim to alleviate some of the worst forms of poverty in the world . #% While this serves to make fishermen ' s lives easier and safer , it does come with certain social costs in terms of employment . #% Unfortunately , that government does not seem to be very prominent in promoting that policy , even though it was adopted back in July 2002 . #% I am pleased that the report emphasises that fishermen and other stakeholders need to take responsibility and ownership concerning any policy to eliminate discards . #% Regional legislation must be in keeping with the international laws in place nationally in Nigeria . #% How can you call in effect for a realignment of taxes in the Member States while such a move is opposed by your own government ? #% Producers or importers should assume responsibility for the recovery and safe disposal of all pesticide packaging and pesticides past their expiry date and revoked pesticides products . #% I am hopeful that policies developed under the newer system , where you have all-stakeholder consultation , will be better than the top-down policies . #% It is only reasonable that the Community should adopt modern technology which will keep pace with what is happening in other sectors . #% Madam President , in September we have the hearings and , as I said , I do not wish to anticipate how they should proceed , but my group 's strong preference is that in September - subject always to the reservations that we must see what emerges - we should take a decision and rid ourselves of a sense of crisis . #% I accept that maybe not all the fears are real , but even the perceived fears need to be dealt with before they get out of hand and become too politicised . #% I support the call for the Commission to bring forward proposals for further progress on this matter and for the Council to adopt the principle of application of the open coordination method and a detailed timetable at the European Council next June , and for the Member States to lay down common objectives and indicators by the European Council in 2006 . #% If there is to be a restructuring of the committees in Parliament let us not fall into the trap of thinking that an Environment Committee could possibly undertake to look at all the aspects of energy . #% Consequently , there is great concern about the implications for the Irish economy and for the employment situation in particular , resulting from a loss of objective 1 status . #% Indeed our written constitution with protection for property rights has proved very difficult for the government to get over many of the issues in relation to designation of sites . #% At the same time we must not strangle or restrict freedom of access for legitimate users . #% On this occasion I simply want to draw the attention of colleagues to the machinations of the Commission which I believe could have damaging consequences . #% Let us start by bringing the innovation unit back from Luxembourg to Brussels , where it can use its skills working with other departments of the Commission . #% Revenue generated by the Emissions Trading Scheme must contribute to the adaptation effort and the EU budget needs to reflect the urgency of coping with such challenges . #% Those of us that must listen to interpretation for nearly every speaker are finding it very difficult to hear with the volume of these mikes . #% If not , why not , if we are serious about exerting serious economic pressure ? #% The compromise which the rapporteur agreed will lead to legal uncertainty and remove an essential power of discretion from judges and national courts . #% I therefore call upon the Commission to sanction an approach capable of delivering a solution and securing the purpose of single farm payments , namely a fair standard of living for farmers . #% That is something which I can not and do not support . #% In collusion with the Socialist Group , the Commission inexplicably last December drew this week 's crisis upon itself . #% Before I make my comments I would like to wish the Irish Government well in their application to have Irish recognised as an official working language in the EU . #% The present system whereby the Commission operates the CAP on a day-to-day basis subject to the overall supervision of the Council of Ministers has been satisfactory and should be maintained . #% Get the sides talking , keep them talking . #% The focus should be accountability and democracy , but Nice was a shambles with the outcome for Ireland that we lose our automatic right to a Commissioner . #% On top of that , as already mentioned by Malcolm Harbour , there is the question of disabled access . #% I accept his reassurance that there is no link whatsoever between the terms of one appointment and those of any other . #% On current predictions Ireland ' s emissions will be up to 40 % above this target . #% They are now threatened with a full-scale invasion by a so-called Christian power , resulting in countless dead . #% We all felt it was a challenge to the legitimacy of the Angolan Government that we were treated in this manner . #% It deals with issues such as rape as a war tool . #% Need I go on telling the House that all these areas are actually suffering ? #% But there is no way out of this impasse unless the United Nations takes the leading role across a range of political activities . #% Madam President , I would also like to thank the Conciliation Committee for its constructive work . #% I ask you , Mr President , to bring this matter to the attention of the President of Parliament , and to ask him to contact the Israeli authorities with a view to allowing this man his liberty . #% It is my hope that we can avoid acrimonious debate and respect the right of Members to express freely their views on a subject that is complex , sensitive and , for many , a matter of conscience . #% The United Nations is the body that commands the support and goodwill of the broader international community . #% 
The tragedy of Burundi continues with total disregard for human rights , summary executions and the massacre of thousands of people over a long period of time . #% We need to respect this diversity and we need to find a balance between diversity and achieving coherence . ' #% Thirdly , the government of Sudan must be specifically singled out to take responsibility for the protection of its citizens and the disarmament of the Janjaweed militia . #% Your Financial Stability Mechanism is a vicious weapon dictated by the markets , masquerading as something benign . #% I commend Mr Menrad and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their work on employee rights . #% We must put the system in place immediately for its implementation . #% There is point at which we have to arrive before that cooperation can really become effective . #% If we are to achieve success in this area , we can not do it by making agreements between our own institutions - the Council , Parliament and the Commission . #% The Commission , after all , is the custodian of the Community budget . #% I welcome the Council 's determination , together with the Member States , to play a full role under the aegis of the United Nations in a global coalition against terrorism . #% For instance , the FAO Code of Conduct provides that states should take measures to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity and should ensure that levels of fishing effort are in line with sustainable use of fisheries resources . #% Not only do I condemn the actions of suicide bombers , I also condemn the actions of the security services of the Israeli state when they act outside international law , making the resolution of that problem even more intractable . #% People in the Congo have not actually made these weapons : they have come from countries in the EU - including France , Belgium , the UK , etc. and elsewhere . #% I likewise request that all further ratifications stop . #% The recent dioxin scare in Belgium , prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain , and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods , have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat . #% Mr President , I fully subscribe to and take as read what has been said so far in relation to the identification and traceability of beef and all beef products . #% While 80 % of the people in our own prisons are there because of drug-connected crime , some of them are not . #% I know there is a multiplicity of these papers and it sounds very good that this should be addressed in some way by the JPA or the ACP member states . #% In conclusion , I also welcome the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty was enacted three days ago and the European Commission has been given enhanced powers to bring forward legislation in the field of consumer affairs with particular emphasis on the protection of human health . #% Anybody who attempts to enter is shot on the spot or tried in military courts . #% That is why the Commission has been trying for some years to convince the Council of the need for a recovery plan . #% So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished . #% These new instruments are exciting , but we have to be sure that many people are not prevented from taking part in the programmes because of their lack of familiarity . #% I would say to the Commission that it is not myself , the rapporteur or any Members in this House with an interest in fisheries , but rather the fishermen who are out there working , trying to make a living and trying to survive in very difficult circumstances who need convincing of the need for this . #% Our resolve and courage at these enlargement negotiations must match those which the candidate countries themselves are showing in enacting wide-ranging new laws as they prepare to join the European Union as full members . #% The United Kingdom Government announced last year that it would offer an extra EUR 8 billion over the 2007-2013 budget period to help the new Member States build their economies and societies . #% I want to see Axis I , in particular , accentuated , not diminished , with money actually getting to farmers , not being hijacked into government departments . #% There are a number of church-based groups which are under serious threat because of their work in support for justice and peace . #% We could use biomass to heat factories , schools and hospitals , if we so wished . #% However , the fears about public services , regulation and extension and the fact that the developing countries do not have the capacity for the administration that an opening-up of service markets will require all mean that the implications of opening up trade in services need to be very fully assessed . #% Advertising for other legally sold products including pharmaceuticals and alcohol is similarly restricted . #% Madam President , for too long Europe has been dominated by the politics of fear : fear of globalisation , of immigration and of a race to the bottom . #% I would also have serious concern about the long-term desirability of becoming dependent on outside sources for our feedstuffs . #% I really regret the way in which the Council has refused to discuss the matter properly with Parliament . #% The Italian presidency should now take up this issue and put it to the top of their agenda . #% In other words , the Commission should have a department of peace and reconciliation and a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation to go to areas of conflict in advance and apply the principles of conflict resolution , particularly those principles at the heart of European Union itself . #% I am pleased to note that the scientific , technical and economic committee have supported the proposal , having examined the report of the advisory committee of fisheries management during its November 1999 session , in addition to the specific provisions on the use of Danish seine nets in the plaice box . #% We are calling on the Palestinian Authority in particular to work for his release as an absolute priority and on the Council and Commission to maximise their efforts to that end . #% Now we have an opportunity for LIFE + to become even more valuable , in particular to the smaller and newer Member States , which could receive a more equal spread of budget over the period 2007-2013 of $ 2 billion . #% We know that each year within the EU there are up to nine million vehicles that are scrapped on an annual basis . #% I welcome the solidarity which all EU leaders showed with the American government and the American people in their time of mourning and grief . #% We have to have regulation , to look at things like public service obligations , important in this field , our cohesion policies , support for smalland medium-sized enterprises . #% The whole process of taking effective action against those who refuse to implement Community law needs to be speeded up urgently . #% Any economic instruments must have clear environmental objectives , rather than fiscal ones , and must be part of an overall package that addresses technological , operational and infrastructural improvements . #% To conclude , it is a truism that once the marine environment has been contaminated or polluted it is impossible to fully clean up and repair the damage . #% In particular I can , like Mr Herman , support fully the points laid out in the Donnelly report . #% We are talking about giving time to the inspectors ; we are not talking about allowing Saddam Hussein to maintain - assuming he has them - weapons of mass destruction . #% We should copy that too . #% Considering that he is part of a government that has taken such a strong line on international terrorism , the way in which he has ducked the issue -- his cop-out here this evening -- is totally amazing . #% They are the people who are best-placed to do so . #% Bearing in mind the severe financial strain of the construction of the new offices and buildings of the European Parliament , is the Court of Auditors satisfied that : ( a ) the appropriate procedure was followed in awarding the contract for the construction of these offices in Brussels ; ( b ) sufficiently rigorous controls were put in place to minimize the cost overruns ; ( c ) the final cost of this complex represents good value for money for the European Parliament , indeed , for the European taxpayer ? #% I intend to use the additional assistance allowance to provide opportunities to young students who are applying in large numbers to my office for work . #% I know there are lots of differences between Member States and indeed between regions and I understand the concerns in remote areas , but we must address that . #% I suppose it is appropriate that a man of his origins should be doing that . #% Fishermen in my region of Northern Ireland have faced closure in the Irish Sea for a long number of years and we have not seen any concrete evidence that this has been a success . #% However , I am pleased that , in this House at least , we are going in the right direction even if some countries , like my own , are dragging their

Commission is going to present its proposals for the next generation of financing instruments for external action , to cover the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework . #% Madam President , at the

unified human rights report for the EU . #% Member States who are reluctant to do this do not want to face up to the fact that our coasts have to be protected . #% Sport can play a vital role in encouraging development and sports projects can contribute to reaching the Millennium Development Goals , especially under themes such as health , education , gender , environment , peace and human rights . #%
