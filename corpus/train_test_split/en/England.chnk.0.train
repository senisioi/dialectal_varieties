Our troops should have been given a clear and finite mission with a realistic exit strategy from the start . #% I hope that the Commissioner can tell us that proper investigations are proceeding in all the Member States as to why organisations like Bioland could perpetrate the scandals they did . #% So we come to the situation of a vessel with a dangerous cargo finding its way into a port by manipulating these contradictions . #% Please look and go back and tell your people the truth . #% What would be the consequences for the European market ? #% We have to have greater clarity and transparency in the authorisation process and this is one area on which the Commission must focus . #% I am sure that Members of this House will know that there is a crucial takeover battle under way at the moment in the telecommunications sector . #% In recent years the European Union has committed increasing resources to election observation missions in ACP countries , but those of us who have acted as observers are acutely aware that a well-conducted election is only the very first step in the process of establishing good governance . #% I have always felt it was a mistake to try to treat governance as if it were a piece of legislation which was first presented by the Commission and then batted between the institutions . #% There are many examples of the peaking of tourism over a small number of months leading to increased environmental damage and strains on infrastructure in certain countries . #% Another result of liberalisation has been the practice of co-sharing , of airline alliances , and in some instances even takeovers . #% I know from the Commission and the Council that this was one of the reasons they thought it was safe to bring this proposal forward . #% As the Commissioner said , it is a human rights issue . #% This factory uses DEHP for devices that help control blood clotting . #% That vital question is never asked by our government or by the EU institutions . #% Firstly , it introduces greater flexibility by allowing amendments to the geographical areas covered and by providing for additional Kilowatt days in response to appropriate technical measures . #% I would commend the report to the House . #% If the members of the high level group on disabilities convened by the Commission are all members of the Council , it is within his power to do that if he wishes . #% The disease could easily happen again anywhere in Europe . #% I hope you will be pleased to hear that one low-cost operator , Easyjet , which serves Luton airport in my constituency , has said that prices need not go up because of this draft regulation . #% We should also take care to provide coherent legislation . #% Commissioner Bonino and her newest Director-General would do well to ponder on how they use their extended power . #% We are also opposed to the derogation for minced beef , which might apply to something like 30 % of the beef output , which ought to be open to labelling . #% I believe that formal invitations will only be sent on 17 May , which is after Parliament has risen . #% I ask this Parliament to support those amendments to ensure that we safeguard our fish stocks and fishing communities for the future . #% Where are we going to find funding for such areas as starch potatoes ? #% I wish to support the committee 's request that , should there be a crisis at the IGC , the President should call a special meeting of the Conference of Presidents . #% Now that you are becoming freer from the constraints of the Presidency , Chancellor Sch√ºssel , would you wish to push forward the debate by sharing with us your top priorities as subjects , as chapters for renegotiation inside Part III ? #% How do we do that ? #% The decision will have to be made on merit and not through the kind of political horsetrading that is currently being whispered about . #% I think the economies of France and Germany are the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park . #% I would ask the Commissioner whether with hindsight he would concede that it was a mistake to agree in July 2005 to the merging of the two consortia . #% In Hong Kong some 450 meetings were organised , yet elected observers were invited to just a handful of them . #% It is likely that it will be even more apparent to the British people at the end of the British Presidency that the British Government should adopt UKIP 's policy of unconditional withdrawal . #% However , those priorities are so open-ended it is almost impossible to imagine anyone disagreeing with them . #% Our approach must be coherent . #% That means we need to press the point again in Vienna for an increase in the transparency and resilience of the international financial system . #% It will of course come up with options when there is a division , but it will work towards reaching a broad consensus as the basis for the work of the IGC . #% In all the contacts that I have made over the years I have been struck by the desire for closer links with the European Union . #% Mr President , broadly speaking , I welcome this report , which is an improvement on last year 's attempt by Parliament to build elaborate and ambitious castles in the air . #% They make an immeasurable impact in their communities and on people 's lives . #% I would ask Members to show some ' 20-20 vision ' and vote for the rapporteur 's amendment , which recognises that these measures sit squarely alongside our wider strategic objectives around CO2 reduction and the Europe 2020 project . #% Since international travel is likely to form the key mode of transmission , we are proposing that there should be systematic virological screenings of air filters from flights originating in countries affected by the virus . #% We need to do even more in terms of education . #% I recognise the improvements the Commission has made - in particular the use of the website to provide information - but we have to focus on transparency and implementation . #% We must also recognise that this is a cod and hake report . #% We can all benefit from that in the sense that we recognize its importance . #% He , of course , was removed twice from the British Government , but to be fair , he is one of the more competent ones ! #% Why are we saving jobs in Mexico with European taxpayers ' money ? #% The British Conservative Delegation fully supports greater cooperation between judicial authorities , especially in the execution of judgments and the service of legal process throughout Europe . #% Commissioner Liikanen keeps promising me that he will put forward a further action plan , but I see no reference to that in the annual programme . #% They are to do with recognising that pay-as-you-go schemes can no longer be exclusively relied upon to keep people 's pension expectations fulfilled and also exhort Member States to sort out their tax and spending policies . #% Above all there has been a change in attitudes and expectations . #% I suspect we do not , so long as we already have criminal , civil , product and environmental liability in law . #% We have instead seen something tantamount to a panic response to concentrated , manipulative lobbying and adverse media coverage fed by deliberate disinformation and misinformation . #% Accidents often occur when young people are unfamiliar with their working environment and to move and work in another European country may create more dangers . #% The fact is - and somebody should say this - that if the IGC fails to resolve the Amsterdam questions , enlargement must be postponed . #% I hope the Presidency will work closely with President Barroso on the economic reform agenda . #% As our resolution states , the United Kingdom - not , of course , as a full member of Schengen at this time - along with a number of other Member States , will not want to be part of this system until a solution has been found . #% Does the President-in-Office not think that all our efforts to achieve high standards of civil liberty and freedom of expression in the Union will be undermined if European police forces take action on the basis of laws and practice which apply in Turkey or , for that matter , in other states which have lower standards , and that some effort ought to be made within the Union to prevent this sort of thing from happening ? #% This common position may not be ideal . #% There should be an inquiry into both the bar and the police and it would be very helpful if the Commissioner could assist in this way . #% It is important for the EU to maintain its dual-track approach and pressure for democratic reforms there . #% Governments will always complain and criticise you , but they need you . #% I do not know whether Thomas Jefferson would approve , but the times in which we live need a balance to be struck between liberty and security . #% Would you , Madam President , undertake to raise with the President-in-office and the Commission what action can be taken forthwith to stop this happening in future by strengthening the regulation , which I believe is No 2679/98 . #% 
However , the report in front of us today is one that will probably have the greatest impact on the safety of Europe 's citizens . #% That is why the Europe 2020 strategy , the Single Market Act , and the Innovation Union , for example , are so essential and must be given the attention they merit . #% Would the quality of information and the competence of those analysing the data improve just because a more demanding procedure was introduced ? #% Indeed , it was Conservative amendments , adopted in committee , which will allow Member States to adopt additional measures in order to place MEPs on an equal footing with members of national parliaments . #% I now hope that all MEPs , including the Socialists , will see sense and either completely remove natural radiation from this directive , or at least pass the compromise that we voted for in committee and leave it up to Member States . #% Clearly the demise of the Cold War has created tremendous pressure because of reductions in demand from EU countries for weapons in particular . #% Mr President , what I really want to ask the Commissioner is that , since it is quite clear that we are not going to reach the large number of questions on BSE , could he please ensure that the written answers which Members will receive go to everyone who has tabled those questions , because all of us would be interested in the answers to the other questions . #% I mean the compromise by which it is understood that the vital national interests of a Member State will not be overruled by a majority vote in Council . #% In my view and that of the committee , the word ` possibly ' should go because only then will we really have a basis for a definitive solution to this issue . #% How could any sane person devise the CFP scheme of quotas resulting in fish caught in excess being thrown back ? #% Mr President , it was late when I made my last speech , it is even later now so I shall be try to be even briefer . #% The Acehnese , although fellow Muslims , almost immediately began fighting for independence , and the province was given special status . #% I also believe that aid and trade privileges must be the carrot that can be coupled to the stick of conditionality as part of the ENP , to ensure that the closer these countries move towards the European Union 's values , the more they can be rewarded in future . #% Mr President , I do not want to detain the House too long but I think that Mr Hannan protests too much ! #% It is indeed vital that we do not provide support to that government unless it forsakes violence , recognises the right of Israel to exist and positively engages in the peace process . #% There is a whole range of technical improvements that have been tried and that work . #% That was such a comprehensive reply that I can not think of a supplementary question , so I will not ask one . #% We are keen to see women be given a role in the marketing and processing of fisheries products . #% Mr President , China is the EU 's second-largest trading partner after the USA and , in economic terms , can not be ignored . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the Innovation Union can help to address today 's societal challenges . #% We all know that the Culture 2000 programme is grossly under-funded . #% The traditional compact -- whereby Iran supports Russia in the OIC over Chechnya in exchange for Russian support in supplying nuclear technology , and its Security Council veto when necessary -- seems now to be dissolving . #% If the market is constrained , if fishermen are not able to directly pass on the costs of fish to their consumers , then that is something that we should investigate . #% But what he is doing here is that he is standing up and defending the Czech national interest . #% As I am sure you are all aware , the threshold issue is something Mr Bradbourn has been fighting for vehemently , not just on behalf of the numerous small and medium-sized businesses in his own region of the West Midlands of England , but for SMEs in general , which , if it were not for these low thresholds would miss out entirely on funding which is there to help them achieve the goals of the programme . #% Finally , I would like to emphasize that we wish the enlargement process every success and look forward to the accession of all the applicant countries which fulfil the Copenhagen criteria . #% That evaluation underlined the fact that the development of the social economy to satisfy unmet needs could create as many as 120 000 jobs in the United Kingdom , 380 000 in Germany and 100 000 in France . #% That was absolutely clear when we were there and it remains the case . #% There are many old buildings in Britain . #% As I have indicated on several occasions , the Commission 's negotiating position is based on an independent analysis of the total cost as well as on those costs that are due to the numerous delays encountered in the renovation project . #% Even when we get into the lifts they are black so we have to have the electric light on . #% Secondly , it shows symbolically the EU 's commitment to playing an increasingly global role in world affairs . #% I am also concerned that the evidence against the people and organisations listed in the Annex has not been seen by European Parliamentarians and therefore we have not been able to decide for ourselves whether those listed are guilty of terrorism or not . #% Secondly , we must not undermine the message : ` autonomy but not independence ' . #% It needs identification of the violations and the steps that need to be taken to rectify them , as in the case of Guinea-Bissau , when free and fair elections were held within the timescale set ; and it needs the maintenance of close political dialogue , something that can be blocked and -- as was seen today -- was sadly lacking in the case of Iran . #% In-fighting within the European institutions brought about the premature termination of the original agreement . #% If the Commission recognizes that at a very simple level , it is surprising that they will not look at the issues which are involved as financial services themselves develop with the possibilities for consumers being ripped-off in the process . #% Obviously too , the consideration of probationary periods in contracts of appointment for managers will be a strong supplement to the direction which we want to take . #% I appreciate that it is a provocative question . #% Mr President , I shall confine my remarks to the Services Directive , and speak as a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% Instead we now urgently need to hold a genuine , substantial debate about the future of the European Union . #% There have been considerable reasons for optimism in the election of President Khatami and the overwhelming vote for reformist candidates in the February elections but , as Human Rights Watch notes , the struggle to control the press is , in many ways , the struggle to control the future direction of the Islamic Republic as a whole . #% Again , I agree with Baroness Ludford 's comments on the first two of those . #% My group will be in favour of postponing discharges both for the Commission and for Parliament until all the information is available to us . #% We must continue to look at this issue . #% We should recognise progress where this has been made , as the Commissioner said earlier in this debate . #% Mr President , Mr Bourlanges is entirely right on the procedure : it would make sense to have a single vote instead of three votes on that . #% I welcome the report 's positive comments about the improvement in cross-straits relations . #% I am not convinced of its urgency in the light of the fact that in South Korea the government of Kim Dae-jung has not allowed any death sentences to be carried out since he took office in February 1998 . #% My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns . #% Although a number of the proposals put forward by the Commission are far from perfect , I congratulate Mr Adam on the effort he has made to put a compromise together in order to present to the Commission a coherent view of the Committee on Fisheries . #% So , are the priorities the right ones ? #% I have met with the dismissed teachers many times in recent months and have read a great deal of documentation from the time leading up to their dismissal . #% In stirring up concern , we exacerbate the public 's fears about these matters unreasonably and excessively . #% The Trademarks Directive in its original form was certainly introduced to protect trademarks and to secure consumer confidence that they would know what they were buying . #% We must ensure that Constitution is adopted . #% I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his comprehensive report . #% Five of these recommendations involve internal measures and five involve cooperation with other countries , both directly and through the medium of regional fisheries management organisations . #% Mr Mayor Oreja heads a special working group on the European Research Council , which has suggested that an independent body of scientists should take the programme of research forward , and that this should happen on the basis of excellence and scientific merit . #% But there has never been a Council common position or joint action under the CSFP calling for the closure of Guant√°namo Bay or even just for the return of our own citizens and residents . #% Let us hope that , through our mutual outrage - in this House and in many other parliaments throughout the world - at this piece of brutal legislation , we can convince the Ugandan President to veto it . #% However , I also want to place on record our support for the trade and aid regulations for northern Cyprus , rather that the wording of Amendment 1 , together with our longstanding opposition to military spending falling under the Community budget . #% We do not have to do that through production subsidies . #% Working together , we can achieve this but I have to say in all honesty that we have worries at the moment about when the Council is actually going to deliver on this . #% Sometimes , in order to be generous , in order to show good sense , it is essential for us also to be firm . #% If there is anyone listening who is in a position to look for a new President of the Commission , my suggestion -- for what it is worth -- would be you , Commissioner Vitorino . #% 
On 23 November , this House itself reiterated the principle of the universality of human rights and non-discrimination as a basis on which to enhance our partnership with the JPA . #% I include the arguments put by Mrs Erikkson for which I have a substantial degree of sympathy . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner to expand on a genuine cross-border problem in the theft of mobile phones : their extensive use in a form of carousel fraud on the VAT authorities in different Member States . #% Mugabe has rewarded his cronies - or so-called ` veterans ' - with confiscated white farmers ' land . #% I would ask Mr Kinnock - and I apologise for the lack of notice - briefly to comment on that dispute and to see how we can best work together to ensure the free movement of people and goods in the future . #% It is indeed ironical that while inspections were taking place throughout countries outside the European Union to make sure that the imported products were in order we had a major problem and a major health risk in our own animals here in the European Union . #% The destruction of an ancient city like Kashgar would simply strengthen the resolve of all of those who would wish to foment violence against the state . #% There is one great myth that has gripped the Left and that is that spam is the same as unsolicited e-mail . #% It is difficult to balance the need for adequate regulation and the safeguarding of patients ' rights . #% Mr President , it is appropriate , I suppose , that this measure has reached this plenary in World Health Week , with its particular emphasis on mental health . #% Mr President , for some time a number of us have been receiving information from the NGO Casa Alianza , which is concerned with street children in Honduras , which has drawn our attention to the jailing , ill-treatment and torture of young people in adult prisons . #% However , taken together they are all aimed at the same thing . #% We must be clear that this is an attempt to deal with a large number of low-value cross-border consumer disputes , outside the normal legal system . #% We have to observe strict confidentiality whilst trying to maximise information to the people who are most entitled to know , including Members of this House , simply because those reports which are now being completed contain a potential for disciplinary and even more grave procedures . #% Mr President , Algeria has been a troubled country for many years . #% I have a very good option : I have a filter , I have a delete button . #% In fact they are highly subsidized agreements which we feel it is very difficult to justify , except by saying that if we do not pay money as taxpayers towards these agreements , we will be undercut by major fishing nations , whether it be Korea , Japan or previously the Russian Federation . #% Why do the EU 's human rights consultations allow Russia to exclude human rights NGOs and why does our human rights dialogue with China not even benefit from simultaneous language interpretation ? #% So I would urge the Commissioner to please have the courage and the daring to reduce tariffs and subsidies drastically and stimulate free trade worldwide . #% For many years I have worked to overcome the problem of anti-personnel landmines but I have always sought to focus attention on the real culprits who use such weapons indiscriminately and irresponsibly . #% She is in Berlin tonight and is to have an operation in the morning . #% Less than 1 % of the 1 393 new drugs placed on the market between 1975 and 1999 were for infectious tropical diseases . #% The most expensive fish in the world , each one selling for tens of thousands of euros . #% The problem , of course , is that you only have to mention the word `` uranium '' and there is an outbreak of what can only be described as mass hysteria . #% However , the new government must continue reforming the judiciary , upholding media freedom , enabling property restitution , protecting minorities and children and fighting organised crime . #% The CAP destroyed areas of British agriculture , and now the EU wants to destroy British organic agriculture . #% I hope that the Commission will take the results of this work very seriously indeed . #% In Mongolia since the fall of Communism , unlike in many of the other countries of Central Asia , we have seen the establishment of a vigorous democracy where political power was transferred from one party to another on several occasions in a peaceful manner . #% As a lawyer , that sounds to me like a very nice , lawyer 's answer . #% However , we still do not have this directive . #% We can not be in a situation where we allow that to happen again , and I therefore salute the measures the Commissioner has taken . #% There is , however , one more very critical point , and I turn again to the Council of Ministers here . #% That wording is one on which we may request a split vote and vote against . #% Mr President , we share Mr Cohn-Bendit 's concern about what I understand is called It is a serious issue . #% This is a huge use of taxpayers ' money which undermines the work of this Parliament . #% As for the United Kingdom , you know all about us . #% We call upon the European Union , and the Commission in particular , to look at and review their programme and to provide good support for those refugees so that they can be retrained and can bring democracy back into the future Iraq . #% After the Bosnian war many of us feared there would be some who would use the peace as an opportunity simply to take breath before returning to their evil work . #% I would like to refer to some concerns expressed by a company in my former constituency and now the south-west region that I represent . #% They see us killing each other . #% Ratification of an ILO convention is not the same as implementation , as trade unionists in Colombia will readily testify . #% I note that my colleague Mr Hatzidakis says ` be bold ' . #% I conclude by saying that I hope the Commissioner will therefore defer the proper concerns he may wish to raise in relation to Parliament 's proposals this afternoon , and commit himself to the further discussions where I agree with his wish , and I quote ` to press ahead together in achieving our common goals ' . #% The EPLP opinion is that this harmonisation of tax base could possibly lead to higher rates , with harmonisation at a later stage which is not desired . #% Mr President , I was wondering exactly what Mrs Thors meant when she said that the proposal was being ` steered into a safe harbour ' , especially as she was looking directly at me at the time . #% Mr President , in welcoming Mrs Kla√ü ' report , I endorse both the Commission 's view that 1996 was the first year in which the current structural fund programme was fully operational and the rapporteur 's view that provisional good marks can be awarded for the first time since 1994 . #% Cooked chicken may come into the UK frozen , then thaw and be eaten with no further treatment from the time the Thais cooked it . #% The worst fears of many people , expressed in this Chamber , have not been realised . #% The main points I would like to raise on behalf of the PSE Group are as follows : #% You have not overpromised , but you have got on and delivered . #% Amendment No 22 allows Member States to exclude reinsurers from the adjusted solvency calculation . #% The opportunity to prevent that exists once and once only . #% Is it not time , therefore , for the EMI and the Commission to recognize that they have to rebalance their own policy ? #% Mr President , there are different approaches to human rights in the European Union . #% It is therefore particularly important that the impact on such businesses is clearly identified and thoroughly assessed at an early stage , so that further revision of the Directive can be considered . #% It is good that it takes place already , but we should not try to narrow it in order to needlessly block much-needed social and employment proposals that will help maintain that overall policy balance established at Lisbon . #% My concern , however , is that if some of the stories about Community instruments are true , the KONVER programme is likely to be lost . #% The content of that accord and , in particular , the investigations into the environmental impact assessment that was agreed , have substantially been carried out . #% I would say that the amendment from the EPP Group is not particularly helpful , since it tries to reduce the scope of this directive to the mining of metal ores . #% Madam President , I have been listening to this debate , especially to Minister Roche , and it has been something of a surreal experience . #% Mr President , the British Labour Members did not support this report . #% That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this . #% I do not normally believe that persons who have not been convicted of crimes should be prevented from moving freely , but there is a European problem that is being ignored at European level . #% We agree upon the importance of providing lifelong learning opportunities , the need to be proactive on increasing women 's participation in the labour market , and the need to do so much more to resolve the challenges of reconciling work and family life . #% We have had a big delay because of the legal adjustments that were necessary because of the Lisbon Treaty , and that has meant that there has been a lot more CO2 emitted than would have been if we had been able to do this sooner . #% We must find the legal basis , the means by which we control the funds , and deal with a whole array of different things to enable us to create a stable , prosperous and secure environment for citizens of the European Union to live in . #% 
We believe that refusal or access to routes is the appropriate sanction for non-EU air carriers and aircraft operators , and that the only sanction we can impose is the denial of access to routes . #% I support this cri de coeur from the Europe textile industry . #% In fact , most developing countries are small , with little capacity to develop a full supply chain . #% Mr President , I should also like to thank Mr Monti for coming to Parliament today and making a very clear statement on a very complex issue . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , in the past , I have often been sharply critical of British Prime Minister Cameron . #% It is in the interest , not only of the indigenous peoples of this region , but all the peoples of Bangladesh that this conflict , costly in both resources and lives , should be settled and peace should be restored . #% Mr President , it is to be hoped Mr Smaghi will bring some semblance of financial discipline to the ECB . #% This debate highlights how the EU institutions seem to rush into debates before fully preparing the ground . #% I wholeheartedly support this report which addresses the need to tackle the growing mountain of waste in the EU . #% The Commission intends to continue its practice of setting annual targets because it has evidently assisted improvement in the gender balance , although patently not enough . #% Despite the unprecedented presence of some French Members , my assessment is that Fridays in Strasbourg do not function properly and effectively for this Parliament and we should transfer more of our parliamentary work to the capital city , Brussels . #% However , I still remain concerned about elements of the report which appear to contradict the EU 's official position on the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue and the Minsk Group 's position in particular . #% Even a temporary exclusion might open up the possibility of imaginative new forms of false self-employment and of collective arrangements being dismantled by unscrupulous employers . #% I did refer cases back where I believed people might be innocent , where new technology -- DNA particularly -- was coming in to give extra evidence . #% I wholeheartedly support this report by Mr Dover which aims to improve working conditions for young people in Britain . #% In my view , and in the view of a great many people , it is necessary that we work towards the elimination of any long-distance transportation of live animals . #% It is through the economics that we must drive this particular relationship . #% However , we are not here today for recriminations but for looking ahead . #% So what does the report recommend that is different , that adds value to this very long-running debate ? #% Because Parliament and the Commission can not agree about what access we have to information . #% I sincerely hope that we can take this proposal forward with sensible steps , bearing in mind the key issues of protecting human health and safety and protecting the public and vulnerable individuals from exploitation . #% The report he has produced by and large reflects the conclusions of that committee . #% Our own research also shows that economic development in the conventional sense is becoming limited in some areas due to lack of fresh water and that the European Union already produces more toxic waste than it can deal with as a by-product of economic growth . #% Some 4 500 workers die each year as a result of accidents at work and many more from work-related illnesses . #% In today 's world almost every technical and industrial innovation requires some form of computer-aided activity . #% On the Parliament : we recommend that Parliament sets up an election coordinating group able to provide much faster and more efficient responses . #% We can expect that all the rivers that drain into the Baltic and the North Sea will become cleaner . #% Wherever we look - whether at the fight against terrorism , the horrors of the Balkans , the nightmare of a small town in Switzerland , the virtual anarchy in parts of Africa - one common theme emerges everywhere : the huge number of weapons which are freely available . #% Mr President , I am delighted that the D√≠ez de Rivera Icaza report has been adopted , and particularly paragraphs 29-31 relating to the very serious problem of aircraft noise . #% I only hope that this enforced wait , which now is inevitable and is frustrating to Montenegro , will not result in a weakening of the country 's commitment to an engagement with the European Union . #% I listened to the people . #% Britain 's record on jobs is far better than the European average . #% The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is now seeing the fourth successful conclusion , at second reading , of an important piece of consumer protection . #% Help is urgently needed . #% I speak , not just as a Member of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , which is interested in information , but also as a Member of the Committee on Petitions . #% They must be put on notice that action will be taken against them . #% So far the ACP has EUR 40 million , which is to be divided between 18 countries , and it is not even clear how it is going to be divided . #% In line with our long-standing position on matters relating to the euro and euro area , I and my British Conservative colleagues have abstained on this report . #% The committee has reinstated the money cut , but has put this money into the reserve pending the answers from both those institutions . #% One of the reasons why we oppose the United Kingdom joining the euro zone is because we wish to keep the power to set taxes , budgets and spending decisions in the hands of democratically-elected national politicians . #% The question of market economy status is dismissed very easily , yet 40 countries in the world have already granted market economy status to China -- most recently the Republic of Korea in November 2005 . #% That does not represent the views of either my group or this Parliament . #% The resolution makes clear there is a need for a proportional system that gives form to women ' s representation and that all political parties must take action . #% I hope that Mr Barroso will make some concessions today . #% I am pleased to note that the Commissioner is not satisfied with the existing situation and I am grateful to her for being so honest and open with Parliament about the unsatisfactory nature of the current situation . #% The presidency and the Commission , with the UN , must take steps to lift their burden through the means of transport and trade , and must do so without delay . #% The Commission has been fully involved in these initiatives , and the European Parliament 's ad hoc delegation , which visited from 8 to 10 February , also raised this issue in the relevant quarters . #% The pressure put on now is absolutely vital for the final result we wish to achieve . #% If that is the case , would he agree with me that any new elections likely to be convened by the military junta in Burma would not be accepted as legitimate and therefore would never be accepted as capable of overriding the 1990 results ? #% Virtually all its external policies in respect of third countries and its policies towards the candidate countries seem geared to causing migration from less-developed countries . #% We should not get things out of proportion , however . #% It seems to me that the Commission is no longer content just to set harmonised standards ; it is now moving firmly into setting standards and priorities for enforcement . #% Will he also take the opportunity to tell us what progress he is making in introducing structured performance appraisal throughout the Commission and in his moves towards a linear career structure . #% This question was developed entirely within their committee . #% That is a major reason for concentrating in the fifth framework programme on this area #% I am fully aware that it is not an easy task to come up with one solution covering all the different conditions facing young farmers in their respective countries in a Community of 15 Member States . #% They must enjoy self-government within a federal democratic Iraq . #% If indeed the north votes ` yes ' and the south ` no ' , the status quo can not endure and a new assessment will be needed . #% We strongly disagree with Mr Hughes , of the British Labour Party , that the European Union should lay down the law with regard to the work/life/family balance of people everywhere . #% When President Prodi first presented the Commission 's proposals I made the point that between 1988 and 2002 , under the existing financial perspective , the amount of payments had indeed averaged out at 1 % of GNP . #% Mr President , I should like to make some constructive points about how to get out of the present mess . #% I commend it for the vote tomorrow and I hope and believe that as many colleagues as possible will support it . #% That is the difficulty now facing employers . #% Mr President , firstly , I should like to pay respect to my colleagues Mr Watts , Mr Savary and Mrs Darras for bringing this point to the House for our consideration . #% British Conservatives support the principle of a common approach to civil aviation security across the EU . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by commending both the Commission communication and Mr Khanbhai 's report . #% 
Fisherman from my constituency believe that industrial fishing is one of the main causes of this state of affairs : both because the smaller fish on which they feed are being taken in huge quantities and because the herring themselves are being caught in the very small mesh nets necessary for industrial fishing , as indeed are undersized immature cod . #% In many countries of Europe you actually see that there are forests being used effectively . #% Mr President , let me begin with three personal recollections . #% I want your assurance today that the impact assessment is looking at the costs imposed on business and making sure the results are proportionate and delivering real consumer benefit . #% The Hughes amendments , if adopted by Council , would place further burdens on the self-employed and on SMEs . #% However , not only do I dislike the content of the proposals , which I will come back to shortly , but I also find it unacceptable that the Commission seems unable to take no for an answer . #% Mr Byrne has left the airport - I assume that is Strasbourg airport - and is on his way here . #% The stated reason is that the existing structures can not deal adequately with terrorism , extremism and serious and organised crime . #% President Habibie has promised reforms and the army , low in morale and divided as a result of the crisis , has begun to exercise some restraint in dealing with opposition demonstrations . #% What relationship will you be able to have with Member States in order to ensure coordination of their independent activities ? #% In the light of that , does he have any target date for the phasing out of age limits in all the EU institutions ? #% Mr President , the Cypriot accession will only have truly succeeded once we have seen a profound reconciliation of Greeks and Turks . #% So the issue is not how we stop it , but how we harness and manage it . #% The PDB actually cut the budget for OLAF by a substantial figure and we had no answers as to why that money had been cut . #% This proposed directive is the Lisbon Treaty doing exactly what its opponents said it would do : which , of course , is why you refused to give the people of Europe a referendum on it . #% It is not our responsibility to be providing our taxpayers ' money to meet Israeli responsibilities . #% Had that system applied today , I am sure we would not have voted for the budget that we now have . #% Last Sunday it killed the much-loved former culture minister , Consuelo Araujo Noguera , and on Tuesday Congressman Octavio Sarmiento . #% We stand by because the economic factors prevent us from acting . #% Mr President , in the wine trade I would be described as an . #% In no way should it be a political appointment or a perk . #% A British Prime Minister came to the European Community on one occasion and asked for her money back . #% Flaunting of the Geneva Convention , as we see on a daily basis at present , is shameful . #% But I am surprised that the House is not debating Burma on this day . #% Because of that there was further United Kingdom legislation and it was brought into line with Community law . #% Mr Watson , who opened the debate , probably has not , because if you look at that regulation - and I was one of the colleagues that worked on it very closely - you will see that it anticipates the fact that we will have convergence and that the big issues that are opened up in the world of convergence are about controlling access to channels . #% We believe that the Commission Work Programme takes forward the Lisbon Agenda and details some necessary environmental action . #% We are currently dealing with a system which is not able to deal with the current or future challenges Europe faces or the political views of its Member States . #% In the same way , I supported thoroughly the Lisbon objectives which the Commission set for themselves , particularly in the field of research and development . #% However I strongly support the proposal for direct representation by patients on the advisory committee . #% I support the decision taken by the Council of Europe . #% The final agreement also sees the inclusion of pilot studies that show the effect of tourism on the environment - an interesting avenue to pursue , given the need for a sustainable tourism approach . #% An opportunity for early reform has been lost . #% In the case of the Member whom you did so name , not only did he return to the Chamber , he also took part in the votes . #% The so-called ` aid ' in reality is the poor helping the poor , as rather than providing new money we are merely shifting money already allocated to the region from people in desperate need to the poor victims of this tragic demonstration of the narrow line mankind walks on earth . #% I would very much like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for entrusting me with this job a week after I assumed my mandate , and I see a number of colleagues are here in support . #% The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and can not economically do so . #% We are debating reports which have been discussed in our various committees in Parliament , we have had the chance to discuss them in our political groups and we are now having a public debate on the floor of this House , as indeed we have had on many occasions in the past . #% I am so pleased to have been able to work alongside several Romanian prime ministers , including the current Prime Minister , Mr Tariceanu , several presidents , including the current Head-of-State , President Basescu , as well as a huge variety of Members of Parliament . #% In the long term it will provide for both monetary and economic stability and low inflation . #% We will stand up for common sense and vote against it . #% Would they rather see the poorest people have no access to health care , rather than go to a private provider ? #% Does the Commissioner see a role for putting price bans and price guarantees in the regulation so it is reviewed after a certain period to ensure that prices are converging ? #% In 1985 , Greenland chose to leave the EU but , when Sweden and Finland joined 10 years later , they substantially enlarged the EU 's interest in the Arctic region . #% Firstly , the enormous increase in direct selling leaves the consumer with both the best and the worst of this new world . #% That is absolutely true , and the more we can learn the better for each of us . #% We could do those two things without the Members ' Statute . #% We were aware of certain frailties that were exposed in the course of Parliament 's approval of the Barroso II Commission . #% On a recent visit to Poland I found there were lots of problems with education , especially in the rural areas where very often young children were not going on to secondary school because they stayed at home to work on the farms . #% Bed nets are a low-tech method of protection from mosquitoes , but very few families have them . #% This simply does not stack up ; surely one thing we have learned in the crisis is that we are very interconnected . #% The threat to Aung San Suu Kyi , which we heard about today , is just part of the repression from the government there . #% There is nothing in the report that is contrary to that . #% This type of technology be used with caution because of the huge impact it has . #% But these must also and will need to be pursued most vigorously in the coming months and years . #% I agree that we need to monitor imports from the less-developed countries in order to prevent fraud and guard against triangular trade , but quite honestly , we are talking about tiny amounts . #% There have been reports on the BBC tonight that the Commission meeting here has worked out a formula for the end of the ban on British beef . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , as chairman of the Delegation for relations with Canada , I warmly welcome this resolution , which is actually a first part of an EU-Canada Summit . #% What we need to do tomorrow is to accept the committee ' s report and move forward . #% We in the Parliament need to be cautious . #% Will he also help the British Government to determine where the foot-and-mouth originally came from , because he said that we do not import from countries that do not have a clean record . #% This is very important . #% I must also insist that Parliament be kept informed of developments in this and other areas , as it is MEPs who have to answer to their citizens when things start to go wrong at Europe 's airports . #% I am confident that the strong warning in the report on Romania will provide the incentive for its government to drive through the necessary reforms to satisfy all the Copenhagen criteria in time for Romania to join in due course , as scheduled . #% We must give Egypt the time to reflect , because if we diminish the rights of individuals living in those countries , ultimately , we diminish our own human rights . #% In that regard , our rapporteurs have produced a balanced compromise that everyone can live with . #% 
Will the Council make contact with the Indonesian authorities ? #% I want to bring to your attention and that of Parliament the tragic and terrible rail crash that took place yesterday just outside Paddington Station in London , in which two trains collided . #% He obviously has learned nothing about public policy if he thinks that we can run the whole of Europe on a series of referendums . #% The Commission is seeking to encourage the government of Indonesia to suspend martial law as soon as possible , and in the meantime has impressed upon it the need to carry out its activities with the minimum possible impact on the well-being of the people of Aceh . #% in writing . - This is a great initiative that will make it easier for people who have lost , or risk losing , their jobs to get credit to start up their own businesses . #% I can think of no circumstances less appropriate to refer a matter back to the committee . #% There would have been no further progress on the production of new items , not just in the makeup field , but in areas such as medicated shampoos and dental hygiene . #% If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead , you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and , as we have heard today , you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament . #% I want to focus on a few other detailed points . #% Let me remind Members and the Council President that without an interinstitutional agreement there is no Agenda 2000 . #% These were considerable achievements but it is important , now we have launched the process , we do not allow other political priorities like a single currency to push enlargement into the background where it would be in danger of becoming bogged down in technical discussions . #% Without concrete explanations from the Council on specific issues , it is not possible to give them the green light for their accounts . #% The European public prosecutor has many problems , not least those previously mentioned by Mr Crowley in another speech , because Britain and Ireland have completely different legal systems to the European continent . #% These EU packaging rules require a step change in recycling activity from British business , consumers and local councils . #% What we have in Europe at the moment are areas which have universal access and universal service , particularly amongst the developed states , but also some areas of the Union where we still do not have universal access . #% If we get to vote on the original text of that paragraph , if we get past the vote on the amendment , at that point I want to propose a vote on the words `` and socially-balanced '' separately from the rest of the text . #% If enacted at Tampere and enforced by Member State Governments it will show to some of our more Eurosceptic citizens that real progress is being made . #% Mr President , you introduced Mr Solana as the High Representative of the European Union 's common foreign and security policy . #% Of course we want a better language regime in this House ; of course we want a statute for assistants ; of course we want the pension fund sorted out ; of course we would like earlier implementation . #% These were the problems that we wrestled with during the passage of the Brussels regulation : how to allow Europe 's consumers access to cross-border justice without over-burdening business and yet , at the same time , exposing business to necessary competitive forces . #% In particular , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Morgantini for her work . #% The scope should be limited to those chemicals produced in volumes over one tonne , as set out in the White Paper . #% Thirdly , this was going to be on the agenda in April but was put back to May in order to allow the groups to set out their positions . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by making a few comments about Mr Knapman 's absurd remarks . #% Poor people frequently depend on fragile ecosystems and therefore conservation and sustainability should be prime objectives of our policy . #% The value of Fair Trade products sold in the United Kingdom doubled between 2002 and 2004 and Fair Trade brands of coffee and tea have become household names . #% There is nothing particularly radical about it at all . #% It is such a weird anachronism that a policy that was communautarised back in the 1950s is as unaccountable and non-transparent as it is . #% This is quite intolerable . #% It is therefore very important that the changes take place within a clear legal framework and with pre-established dispute resolution mechanisms . #% A ` no ' vote against Pakistan would risk this Parliament being accused of double standards . #% I think our deliberations today have been very much about the key issues of environment and agriculture and also the social clause issue , but I want to bring to your attention the specific needs of the cultural industries and the audiovisual sector . #% Also , during a recent visit to Malta I saw the wonderful work being done in connection with sexual orientation . #% That is a lot of money , which in one sense , could have gone back to the Member States . #% We must strongly urge both sides to renew their efforts to ensure that the objectives of the San Andr√©s agreements are achieved in full , without any further injuries or loss of life and , to this end , to meet with a will to succeed , come what may . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would like to say to the Commissioner that European citizens are losing confidence and trust in more and more European programmes . #% Neither represent any conceivable threat to the Italian State . #% They do not require EU involvement and should only be undertaken for clear economic , strategic and industrial motives - not to further EU ambitions to be a global actor . #% I am interested to see that he has maintained today his 100 % record of turning up and defending the interests of the British fishing industry ... by his absence here ! #% Ireland , as we know , has been looking at this legislation for many years and has done absolutely nothing about it . #% That contrasts markedly with Turkey and the western Balkans , which are offered full membership -- clearly , in my view , a morally unsustainable position in the long run . #% I ask you to lead that argument in Johannesburg too . #% Data protection therefore needs to be thought of differently , encapsulating data together so it can not be amalgamated in an unauthorised way . #% This represents a huge push factor for emigration including to the European Union . #% Will that remain the case ? #% The World Food Programme is hampered by difficult terrain , destroyed infrastructure and Taliban policies which prevent female participation , and which have led to the arbitrary arrest of aid workers on charges of religious proselytising and a ban on communications with the outside world , so essential to an international aid programme . #% If there is any change to that , this Parliament needs to be notified far in advance of tomorrow . #% In paragraph 4 , we note that China will have at its disposal EUR 1 billion in farm reserves by the end of 2006 . #% We in the United Kingdom are glad that we are not part of the euro , but we wish you well . #% This directive is about improving the standard of living of all citizens in the European Union and encouraging growth and dynamism in the economy . #% We need to look at employability as far as the welfare state is concerned . #% It is not acceptable that our citizens should behave abroad in a way that they would not behave at home . #% However , we have been waiting for a number of reports , especially the Zappal√† report , to come to the floor of this House for a reasonable period of time now . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , as this House is well aware , this proposed regulation on the banning of exports and storage of metallic mercury is in line with the commitments contained in the Mercury Strategy which we passed in March 2006 . #% Consumer disputes of this kind are deeply problematic and painful for the people involved and I hope the Committee on Petitions can help . #% The value of their property is being wiped out by a development control law that does not seem to be working . #% The regional integration which is part of the EPA process will help ACP countries to prosper , to increase South-South trade and the removal of tariff barriers between neighbouring ACP countries . #% Why does the Council support UN reform which puts human rights onto an equal footing , yet itself have a part-time working group , compared to other foreign policy working groups which are staffed by permanent Brussels-based officials ? #% The Commission 's original proposal failed to do almost all these things , and Mr Wuermeling 's report , which we warmly welcome , is a significant step in the right direction and a substantial improvement . #% Mr President , I was part of the Observation Mission , too , and the first-round polling day passed surprisingly smoothly , given the enormity of the task . #% Secondly , the excellent work of President Artisari shows that the EU can take decisive diplomatic action . #% People are right to say that the power to step back from the brink here is basically with President Musharraf and his supporters . #% I direct honourable Members to Article 4 ( 3 ) - public interest disclosure . #% Is existing legislation being properly enforced and implemented ? #% Therefore , the aims included in the revision of these directives - to make the rules clearer , simpler to operate and unambiguous , and to allow the incorporation of new technologies such as electronic auctions - have to be commended . #% A harmonised wage and pensions policy is not just a dream ; it is illegal . #% 
That is not acceptable , particularly when culture can be so very important in our national and regional development . #% Trade relations can not be divorced from human rights and development concerns . #% I would also like to join in congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent job well done and make two points which have been mentioned by others before . #% We have seen on the front page of the Financial Times several times and heard from the head of the New York Stock Exchange that it is possible the US Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance rules could apply to the merged exchange , with jurisdiction in US courts . #% It is right that libraries , museums , universities and other archives , which would have been covered in the original proposal , are now excluded from the directive . #% The Minister gave a long and interesting speech , but he has not answered the question about an Olympic truce . #% I suggest that this report is not properly thought out . #% The Americans have constantly referred to the risk of malicious prosecution and we support their concerns . #% Of course there are concerns , but I would say that , given the turbulence we are now seeing in North Africa and the Middle East and against the background of a continuing threat from Islamist terrorism , never has it been more important for us to send a positive signal to Turkey that she is welcome in the club of the European democracies . #% Will you make it your business to protect the ACP sugar-producing countries at this time , when they are feeling so vulnerable ? #% Part of the problem with this topic is the whole issue of jargon , and our question perhaps falls into that trap by talking about flat-rate Internet access . #% The important thing is that once again it seeks to strike the essential balance that was established at Lisbon : the balanced policy mix combining economic , social and employment policies in an overall framework of sustainable development . #% Instead , there has been widespread corruption . #% Overall , however , I welcome the inclusion of the granting of certain operating permits in these Directives and the great accountability required of decision-making bodies . #% For some reason a nasty virus has descended upon me in the last three quarters of an hour so if I do not make a great deal of sense and if I leave early I hope the reasons are at least forgivable . #% The authority should be financed entirely from the budget , on which this Parliament can share the decisions . #% Cooperation should determine the dynamics and development of European collaboration . #% I have been given a clear understanding that the Global Health Fund 's transitional working group meeting in Brussels agreed USD 100 million for a board seat , that the Global Fund secretariat has already budgeted for a USD 120 million European Community contribution for next year , and that approved projects will be cut if we fail to match that figure . #% That was not to be and therefore we have a supplementary and amending budget where we see a figure of ECU 1.2 billion being reallocated because of mad cow disease . #% Under international law , the entire island of Cyprus will join the European Union on 1 May , regardless of the result of the referendum , and Turkish Cypriots will become EU citizens . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , may I first say that I have sympathy with the workers in Antwerp , but I would like to point out another couple of issues regarding the EU and General Motors . #% Whether it is right is a different issue . #% I am glad that they have . #% He has worked closely with us in our committee on a very difficult dossier and very challenging topics . #% He had been followed by people he believed to be paramilitaries and had received a message on his answer-phone : ` back off or die ! ' . #% The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national , regional and local government . #% What you are doing is threatening the very basis of national self-determination and democracy . #% There seems to be broad support for the proposition that each directive and regulation should be prefaced by a non-legally binding citizens ' summary . #% In particular , I am encouraged to see how the role of the European Monetary Institute is shaping up and look forward to seeing the institute become the central bank . #% Does Labour represent them any more ? #% They and the other parents of sons and daughters who have died deserved an explanation . #% We also have to explain to our citizens what we are trying to achieve with the Mediterranean project because , as Mr Sakellariou has already indicated , there are many misunderstandings about our aims . #% Secondly , we are reluctant to accept issues of conscience in political reports and believe that Member States should legislate on issues concerning abortion and contraception . #% We need to look at the seamless nature of the world we live in , in terms of the buying and selling of foodstuffs . #% It is crucial that we in the European Parliament support such important measures to improve equal opportunities for people with disabilities . #% The thrust of the Transport Committee 's position is to ensure that legislation applies to ships passing through EU waters , not just ships which are docking in EU ports . #% Mr President , I recognise what the Commission is doing to prepare for the implementation of our programme to improve sanitation . #% A spokesman for the Treasury , the Financial Services Authority and the Government Actuary all arrived together , clearly having rehearsed their parts to the nth degree . #% President Borrell goes on about the reunification of Europe . #% There are no caged beds in any other accession country apart from these four . #% Indeed the case of the fine that the Greek Government is still paying to Brussels for failing to comply with a waste directive shows that it can be a quarter of a century before a Member State is even taken to court for failing to comply with legislation effectively adopted in the 1970s . #% I have to say that over the next five years the power of electronic commerce will act more quickly to create the single market than any amount of harmonising legislation that we might care to introduce in this Chamber or anywhere else . #% I also made the point at the Convention that , in contrast to the American War of Independence , where the cry was ` no taxation without representation ' , we in this Parliament have the luxury of having representation without taxation . #% This head-in-the-sand attitude can not prevail if we are trying to be serious about how we manage the Union 's budget and the taxpayers ' expenses in the future . #% To do that , it is necessary to have higher levels of protection to ensure that public health is protected and to ensure the environment in general is protected from any dangers that might arise from experimentation . #% In conclusion , and on reflection , I give the ombudsman 9 out of 10 for his first report , but I have to say I reduce the score for his pamphlet to 1 out of 10 and plead with somebody to make that more attractive so that the citizens know that they have the ombudsman and Parliament on their side . #% In that respect I believe Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 4 help the report by underlining the complementary role of ombudsman and Petitions Committee . #% Firstly , the matter of staffing . #% But at the heart of this lies the clash between the free world and what remains a dictatorship . #% When I was the UK Minister responsible for carriers ' liability and other immigration issues , I always found that although the UK had strict rules on carriers ' liability the system itself was open to criticism for being to some extent unbalanced and unfair . #% With this particular piece of legislation we have to recognise a number of things . #% I would stress that there are a whole range of issues on which we should be able to find common ground . #% He said that this would be high on his agenda and that the need was for structural change in European industry . #% Secondly , how can a career structure retaining four different categories meet the objectives of a linear career structure with progression on merit as strongly supported by Parliament ? #% They voted against in the north-east by 90 % in the one opportunity they had , and they will do so elsewhere . #% We have tabled a series of amendments clarifying the package of qualifications that will enable professionals to move into each of the levels that are to be mutually recognised . #% The institutional Treaty-based arrangements for food aid are , in my view , still somewhat outdated and created with a world in mind where food aid was assumed to be a major feature of development and of humanitarian assistance and relief . #% It is indeed an improvement , we will be voting for it and I commend it to the House . #% But in putting this before the House we have to ask ourselves two very important questions . #% We have reached a point where it actually does not matter what any of you say . #% It can cause over-evaluation of currencies . #% Will we see a draft before Gothenburg . #% There is an obvious danger of applying it too widely because it brings the European Union approach into disrepute . #% Much has been said about the one issue that is dominating category 4 : namely , what is to be done about the funding of Iraq . #% My amendment therefore says that it is doubtful whether the private sector will come up with the goods early enough . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I was not going to take my speaking time on behalf of the group but I thought I could actually split it and come in afterwards but apparently , on a resolution , that is not the case ; so I was informed this morning that I was coming in now . #% 
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme . #% Mr Fern√°ndez-Albor has stuck much more closely to the practicalities of the issue and , as a consequence , has made some telling points . #% I want to say to Mr Jarzembowski that this law would be devastating for jobs . #% It is about the future -- what comes after 2006 -- that there is much concern . #% So why is the Commission creating even more laws ? #% However , one giant leap for the EU does not make one small step for the WTO . #% We already know the British position . #% It is very easy to set targets and to make promises - as Chancellor Schr√∂der has found out - but the jobless need action and not words . #% We have actually seen the documents in their real true-life format , which means that we do not know how to make amendments to them . #% I would also urge colleagues to support mandatory country of origin labelling . #% Again , the benefits of these exchanges are substantial in every possible sense . #% As you have all mentioned , NGOs and others have been somewhat critical of the Outcome Document of the summit . #% I have seen at first hand the distress that physical , psychological and sexual abuse can cause and the state of vulnerability of its victims . #% India is committed to the Millennium Development Goals and its own five-year plan exceeds UN expectations , but there is increased doubt that India will meet four out of the eight goals on schedule . #% Similarly , I hope for a positive vote on Amendments Nos 71 and 73 which guard against any adverse effects the directives might have in both the shorter and longer terms . #% It is about the rights of this Parliament and that is the message they have to understand through and through . #% I do not necessarily believe either that intervention is the answer . #% Why did the Council delete the reference to a better economic policy mix more favourable to growth ? #% The report also proposes the inclusion of services that were exempt from the original directive in 2006 : healthcare , transport and social services . #% So , the Irish were kept in ignorance . #% I hope it will continue to drive home its message , as will the European Union , that the Dayton accords are the basis on which there will be peace and stability in the former states of Yugoslavia in the future . #% At the moment , the different levels of registration tax in differing Member States distort very markedly indeed the price of cars . #% It is not a centralising treaty and the critics , of course , know that . #% This gulf extends to the contradiction between what the Council is saying and what the Commission is doing . #% Once again , therefore , this Parliament , with its mania for regulations and its one-size-fits-all mentality , is obstructing the very things many of its Members profess to support : variety , diversity and quality , to say nothing of support for small and medium-sized enterprises . #% However , President-in-Office , I would like to know what your position is . #% It is going to create another thousand jobs . #% I particularly welcome Mrs Hermange 's Amendment 6 on better harnessing of the structural funds for delivery of the guidelines . #% We need a reinforced political dialogue . #% In the Council the CFSP has had its weaknesses as we have outlined before and there is not sufficient evidence of a coherence of approach . #% The world will demand that and our citizens will expect us to fulfil our role as their protectors for a consistent removal of health threats and risks . #% There was one test on rats in which massive quantities of phthalates appeared to cause problems , but researchers have been unable to replicate this test . #% A few nights ago I was in my hotel room watching German television . #% Nobody wants special treatment for Turkey and nobody should ignore the series of problems over the treatment of the Kurds or over the situation in Cyprus . #% I hope Parliament will be able to support my proposal for a study based on best scientific evidence before any decision is made . #% What the report does say is that money is allocated for Community initiatives and innovative measures , some of which are outside the main objective areas and that it was not spent or only beginning to be spent during the year in question . #% There is nothing more important to Europe than to ensure that the Lisbon Agenda succeeds . #% I want to highlight two particular issues of concern that I raised during the debate and was particularly pleased were reflected in the amendments . #% However , I do agree with my colleagues on the Budget Committee when we say that we will proceed with caution . #% Freedom is both a political concept and an economic one which is vital for the development of the region . #% I hope that Parliament will look at it sensibly . #% Clinical research is slow and patchy . #% I therefore recommend this to the House . #% in writing . - Members of the European Conservatives and Reformists strongly support equal treatment for all regardless of race , religion , sexuality , or disability , and strongly condemn discrimination in all its forms . #% Private monopolies can be just as inimical to freedom as state monopolies . #% Nor can I believe it is economic to try to transfer them : a few hundred boats to replace thousands that were lost . #% That is something we should be asking for anyway as a European Parliament , because ever since we enlarged the Union northwards it has been a bit silly to have our elections in June , which is the main holiday period in the northern countries . #% Whilst Spain is being given exemption , the British meat industry is suffering heavily from the implementation of an allied directive which requires ruinously expensive veterinary checks in our slaughterhouses . #% It is no good sitting here self-satisfied with the fact that we have created the single currency ; we have to see how we apply that single currency and what role it is going to have in our lives . #% As we heard , 1.6 million to 2 million people die annually from the disease . #% We need the budget lines for the Commission to implement its programmes and we need a proper coherent strategy in Europe if this programme on information technology is going to benefit our people - our young people in particular . #% This is nothing to do with marking , it is nothing to do with third-party testing ; it is actually the basic principles of transferring information and knowledge so that we get safety designed into the products from the beginning . #% That is discrimination . #% Although I accept that he can not change the Council 's position tonight , but could he not tonight agree to find space on a Council agenda to allow an opportunity for our Irish friends to put this issue to the Council with that fresh information so that it can be reviewed in the light of that information ? #% Several speakers this morning have referred to the UK ' s role in this matter . #% Concerning junior doctors , I was delighted that the European Parliament , in committee , has agreed on Amendment No 5 with regard to a transitional period of four years instead of the Council position of nine years , which I believe is too long . #% That is the reason for my report - to protect children , to try and help children to avoid being abused in this particular manner . #% She uses a vernacular word to describe the report and then says : ` If I came up with this sort of report for my boss -- devoid of fact and with a hefty dose of moral posturing -- I reckon I would get fired ' . #% We must be practical and sensible in our approach , but we must act . #% In his article ten days ago , the US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff complained of being handcuffed and prevented from using all available resources . #% The latter are the two sites where reactors are now being completed to western safety standards . #% But I think young people want the four ` Es ' - education , employment , environment and Europe ' . #% In severe circumstances people die . #% So if it was legal in 1657 for a Frenchman to sell his chocolate in London , can I suggest to the House that , some 350 years later , it should at long last be legal for an Englishman , or indeed any other EU national , to sell his chocolate throughout the EU including the country of the rapporteur . #% Thirdly , the idea that the European security and defence policy has anything whatsoever to do with reinforcing Nato is , at best , disingenuous and at worst a political deceit . #% In moulding a greater Europe we have a significant challenge , but mobility in Europe - student mobility for instance - is still very low . #% 
Why is it that motorists in Greece or the UK - it could be my car , Commissioner - have to remove their European symbol and replace it with a white sticker with black letters when they travel to France ? #% One would suppose , therefore , that the Commission will do its best now to be open and transparent . #% I would like to pick up one or two of the policy issues . #% Because of recent research published in magazine in October , attention has focused on naval sonars . #% As much money is now being lost through fraud and mismanagement of funds in the 2000 budget as when we made the pledge in 1999 to try and sort this out . #% Last week was also Endometriosis Awareness Week . #% That is what we have been talking about for months , and Mr Prodi 's introductory remarks made it clear that the Commission too accepts that it means equivalence with the Council . #% The World Bank predicts a huge growth spurt of 5 % per annum if they do so . #% However , we have to ensure that there is follow-up on these matters . #% Saddam is indeed dangerous to the region and beyond , and dangerous to his own people . #% We say every time ` this is the last chance ' and surely this must be it . #% However , the fight against terrorism can not be used as a smokescreen to cover malpractice or wrongdoing . #% Mr President , in the concluding part of this package of directives , the universal service and users ' rights directive , for which I have been privileged to be rapporteur , are very much at the cutting edge of the whole package . #% I thank the presidency of the Council for that reply , but I am bound to say that I find it , yet again , disappointing . #% The autocrats will have won out over the democrats . #% paragraph 15 - we do not agree that the EU has a role in coordinating intelligence ; #% Theoretically , it becomes possible for a new British Government to be out-voted over the deployment of its own troops already committed by a previous administration . #% The one thing we will not stand accused of - I am not saying that you said this but many of your colleagues in the Council seem to think this - is that we just want to increase expenditure to the maximum so that we can finance the projects that we see as our favourites , while you want to be extremely prudent . #% Let us be open to new ideas and provide a strong focus on policy priorities , while improving the EU 's accountability . #% Very high-yield oil seed rape grows right next to an existing petrochemical industry . #% I would have liked a stronger statement on people with mental health problems , as the rapporteur knows , but I am pleased that they have been included . #% We particularly value our regular and open exchanges with the Subcommittee on Human Rights . #% I want to pay tribute to all those who brought this about under the Treaty provisions for consumer protection , which had not been used very frequently up to now . #% It is conceivable that part of the estimates which they are making relate to the anticipated costs associated with enlargement . #% I would like to repeat , at this point , the Council 's warm welcome for the re-establishment of Parliament 's Subcommittee on Human Rights last year . #% Meanwhile , Turkey 's EU membership application remains problematic , not least in the field of human rights . #% Finally , I should like to ask the Commissioner about the hidden negotiations that nobody talks about anymore , the parallel negotiations to extend the European Economic Area to the accession countries . #% The ` least bad ' solution - and I use that expression again - is for the EU to insist that non-compliant Member States spend their regional funds on stamping machines and also to pay for an inspectorate whose staff are nationals of compliant Member States . #% I was pleased that Mrs Echerer accepted our view that , in the internal market for services , and this week Commissioner Bolkestein has been here presenting a wide-ranging new proposal for that in that new proposal for the internal market for services , those elements of collecting societies ' activities where they are directly providing services to their members need to be treated like any other service provision and looked at in the context of the cross-border market for services . #% NATO should be the military security organisation of first resort not only for collective defence , but also for the full range of military crisis response operations . #% It was therefore disappointing that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development introduced many additional over-detailed amendments to link support primarily to farmers and weaken the commitment to wider rural development . #% I very much welcome the Commission 's confirmation that Bulgarian accession should take place on 1 January 2007 . #% However , I do not think that the Progress programme should be jeopardised by the reallocation of funds to the microfinance facility . #% Clearly the very ambitious reform contained in your paper is going to be a formidable task for the managers you appoint . #% For the relatively small investment of less than 3 % of the UK defence budget over a 20-year period , the UK can maintain a vital defence capability . #% However , further work will have to be done on creating closer organizational links between the WEU and EU which under the protocol on Article J VII of the Amsterdam Treaty must be in place within a year of the Treaty entering into force . #% It appears also that Members of Parliament are not very concerned as the auditorium is now half empty . #% Before you could say `` knife '' I had opened my wallet , put my money on the table and had a copy of the book . #% Turkish failure to recognise the rights of the Kurds is the biggest single reason for its breaches of European democratic and human rights norms and the pretext for its military-dominated state . #% However , my Group will not support the amendments to Article 4 with regard to the bans on heavy metal . #% This organisation serves 27 of the countries of Europe including the countries of the European Union . #% I do not think fines should be imposed automatically . #% By introducing greater certainty in business transactions across Europe , small companies will gain confidence in trading , not just across Britain , but right across the European Single Market . #% Deadlines must be set so that we can achieve common ambitions in the areas that will dictate the terms of the 21st century : protection of intellectual property rights , open markets for services and investment , and effective trade defence instruments . #% I believe that the European Council , at its summit in June 2006 , should endorse the decision for the accession of Bulgaria on 1 January 2007 , at the same time confirming the remedial action that is required of Bulgaria in the months ahead and the nature of possible post-accession monitoring . #% The potential for this was confirmed last year by the ACP Council . #% But there are other illnesses : TB , malaria , river blindness and the mental and neurological health area which this year was designated by the WHO as its key area . #% He also realised that to succeed his project should not be seen just as his own personal project : he was willing to share the credit -- the ownership -- of the draft Treaty that this Parliament produced . #% I think it is timely that we now hear the view of the Commission . #% These concerns only increase with the organisation of mini-ministerials and ` super green rooms ' where the majority of developing countries are either uninvited or unable to attend . #% So how will Denmark , the Netherlands , Belgium , Austria , Finland , Italy and , to a lesser extent , Sweden and France , meet the Kyoto targets ? #% There is a precedent for us to meet in Brussels because the part-session on Saturday , 2 May 1998 , when Parliament gave its verdict on the Ecofin decision on which Member States should join the euro , was held in Brussels . #% What matters , however , is the process that has now been established . #% This resolution does not hold back on criticism of Mr Lukashenko , but it sets out a kind of road map for him to normalise relations with the EU . #% . ` I and my Conservative colleagues ' voting decision on the resolution on the mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda is based on the need for economic reform , greater labour market flexibility , more competitive taxation policies and reduced barriers to employment growth , particularly the excessive regulation that pervades many European economies . #% I believe that we have sorted out the problem all the parties in this House had in finding a suitable wording for an amendment about OLAF 's funding for the coming year . #% I believe that is correct and I shall be interested to hear what the Commissioner has to say about it . #% That miracle has been achieved by a lot of work between us in this Parliament . #% We need capacity and speed . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this resolution because ensuring that young citizens can travel and work throughout the EU is essential in order to boost competitiveness . #% There are some worrying signs in this respect and Commissioner Vitorino is quite right to warn us . #% It is important , however , that when the Community allocates funds for trying to combat poverty and provide the basis for sustainable development , those funds are fully and effectively spent . #% As you know , there is going to be a general election in the United Kingdom within the next few weeks . #% Could he tell us if and when we can get hold of that agenda , what will be on it and what kind of report we can expect from that meeting ? #% But I consider that we have made substantial progress towards achieving that , on the one hand in the general ambit of the Financial Regulation , but more specifically in the reforms adopted by the Commission , in some cases as recently as July 2003 . #% It also recognises that so that not everything is done at the level of highly centralised national lists , regional constituencies , which are closer to the people , should be possible , especially in the larger Member States . #% 
Was it really that unimaginable that Israel would seize this as an opportunity to march back into Gaza ? #% There are a few strange little things in the text where I think the lawyer-linguists need to look at some of the translation versions . #% But it is worth saying straight away , as confirmed at the Lisbon Summit , that the issue of the development of SMEs is not just a matter of funding . #% It has been necessary to deal with the frustrations that have been felt by many professionals about some of the difficulties in accessing their rights under internal market legislation . #% Even with a moderate level of reduction , effects on communities are severe . #% This is unnecessary regulation and I would appeal to MEPs to reject it in the same way as the Committee did . #% We must use a more sophisticated sliding scale of sanctions and make it easier to find political agreement in the EU to apply them . #% That was never intended . #% The unrest is exacerbated by the Indonesian Government 's exploitation of the province 's gas and petroleum resources as well as the policy of transmigration which has seen many Javanese come to live and work in the province 's coastal and industrial belts . #% It is also right to deal with this matter at European level . #% I hope that in future we will avoid too many referenda and too many votes being taken on particular subjects . #% Are they going to put in place the sort of legislative and regulatory measures necessary to develop information technology ? #% My friend and colleague , Mr Walter , has made the point that there may be a change in the vote of his particular Group , in which case there would not be a qualified majority and therefore the problem would be solved . #% We in turn , if visas are granted , should be prepared to report fairly and honestly all that we see and hear several years on now from the dreadful deaths of Deli . #% One such example is the idea of infrastructure charging . #% This is a complex but necessary piece of work and it helps to answer the question of what the European Parliament does to benefit people . #% I therefore ask the Commissioner to take that on board . #% The UK currently has a derogation from EU law whereby the export of horses and ponies from the UK to the continent for slaughter is prohibited . #% Terrorists have no power if they do not inspire fear . #% If we are to have a reinforced High Representative for Foreign Affairs , the main task should be working closely with Member States in coordinating common policies where they have shared objectives . #% This month more than 30 new cases of cholera have been reported . #% This is no time for rhetoric . #% My conclusion is that we need to reinforce our monitoring of the implementation of citizenship and human rights standards . #% We welcome the threat of resignation by President Khatami , the cabinet and dozens of MPs , should the Council of Guardians veto legislation that is being proposed to limit its current absolute power . #% In fact , it is about one third of the increase announced this year for the farm budget in the EU , so it is not unthinkable that we can achieve this amount . #% I agree with all those who say that all options must be left available to the West to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran . #% In my view , the EU should properly evaluate this option during the forthcoming dialogue brokered by the High Representative . #% My second area of interest is the environment . #% Is it political expediency that prevents us from doing that ? #% Certainly that synthetic euro included currencies such as the Italian Lira , but the same point applies even to the mighty German Mark on its own . #% It is unacceptable , in my view , for taxpayers ' money - for public funds - to be spent promoting the euro in the ` out ' countries , because they are engaged in a very important political process . #% I am sure that every Member State wants to send its minister to Brussels to agree to environmental directives ; that is just our problem . #% Can we here in Strasbourg even begin to contemplate the misery and desperation that drove those Chinese people to spend months travelling in clandestine fashion halfway across the world ? #% It sets up a process to wind up the ` Oil for Food ' programme while ensuring that oil can only be sold for the benefit of the Iraqi people and it creates a new fund for the reconstruction and humanitarian needs of Iraq which involves the IMF and the World Bank . #% The second casualty has been the Commission 's claim to be neutral in its support both for economic developments and for environmental protection at one and the same time . #% The oral amendment is to change the word ` little ' to ` limited ' , so it would read : ` ... which have as yet had limited effect ' . #% The Ryder Cup which , as you know , was held in Spain for the very first time recently , is probably the only competition where almost the entire population of Europe actually cheers for Europe . #% Mr President , on a point of order under Rule 9a and Annex XI of the Rules of Procedure , I should like to ask the President if he would refer the events of this morning 's STOA management committee to the Anti-Fraud Office for investigation . #% As a delegate last week in Geneva , I witnessed that the Commission is arguably one of the most ineffective Commissions known to those long attenders . #% It is a Bureau responsibility and I ask the Bureau to take its responsibilities seriously . #% This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1 , 4 and 7 . #% Perhaps the growing torrent of damaging legislation imposed on the United Kingdom might help to bring the British Government and its people to their senses and bring forward the day of Britain 's unconditional withdrawal from the European Union . #% This is either about the free movement of all of our citizens or it is not . #% Hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed and thousands presently face death on a daily basis . #% The one thing we must always emphasise with all this is that these types of fuels and biomass are very environmentally friendly . #% Of course , if there are problems with one visa waiver agreement , this undermines the others , so there is a certain onus for responsibility and solidarity and for all citizens to be aware that they could harm other people 's chances of free travel . #% At that time we had very high hopes that the whole of Europe would become a human rights-favourable zone but of course things never turn out exactly as one hopes . #% Everybody here has been deaf to what I have been saying on this , but I believe there is now a body of support across this Parliament to end these deals . #% Some rationalisation has therefore been achieved in this report to ensure that multicentre trials , especially those covering a number of EU Member States , are using the same information and products of the same high quality . #% The best forum for dealing with security policy issues is NATO rather than the European Union and the danger is that the common European security and defence policy , with its emphasis on an autonomous capability , will undermine the alliance which served us so well during more threatening times . #% As regards the interpretation of statistics in the annual report , the scope for interpreting the figures is still restricted because of the many causes of infringements , the Commission 's great dependence on complaints and the political dimension of the work arising from the fact that proceedings are at the Commission 's discretion . #% The situation of disabled and mentally ill people is also of concern . #% Do not run before you can walk . #% I hear that the Socialists and other Groups are actually thinking of granting discharge and I can not think why . #% Chancellor Merkel has made it clear that she is determined to press on and , in fact , this very week in Berlin discussions about the Constitution are going on in secret . #% At this point it would be interesting to hear from Commissioner Lamy which LDC countries in particular are likely to export arms , as the title of this initiative is a bit perplexing . #% That businessman 's used car business is under investigation as a possible front for drug trafficking and therefore as an easy way to launder the profits of this destructive trade . #% With every day that passes , we hear of other substances which are causing concern because they may be excluded . #% If this fails , let it be Council 's fault , not this Parliament 's . #% Mr President , following what you have just announced , I must draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is an oral question to the Council on Wednesday night 's agenda regarding the Energy Community Treaty , which we are due to debate that night . #% This cooperation is good news and to be encouraged and supported . #% Mr President , of course what we recognize in this debate is that the long-running banana drama actually crystalizes the elements of the debates in Europe about the whole issue of preferential access . #% Last but not least is the question on the administration , where the Council actions on first reading to effectively diminish the number of Commission posts by some 2000 in the next few years are something we have not been able to sign up to . #% That is a very different agony to a redundancy notice in an industry where profits often exceed the wealth of states . #% A word of praise from our political opponents for the British Presidency : it has done well to secure an agreement between the 25 Member States without sacrificing nearly as many of the original objectives as some of us feared . #% The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison . #% 
Within the delegation there is deep disagreement . #% So it has not gone well and I am finding it extremely difficult to reach a point where we can coordinate the whole system . #% At the moment , we are dumping subsidised goods on lesser-developed countries , which does not help their community , economy or farmers at all . #% We are not convinced that this recital would have an impact on the Netherlands , since this legislation appears to be much more applicable to the ten new Member States than to the ` old ' Member States . #% A moving picture is the only one that tells the full story and the Commission is totally committed to ensuring that priority is given to merit and full and proper account is taken of geographical balance , which is essential in a multinational serving institution like the Commission . #% Madam President , I am sure all Members of the House are very happy to contribute to the Commissioner 's aim of reducing the amount of legislation on the statute books , in this case by reducing some five or six directives to just one . #% However , as we all know , everyone wants someone else to do it . #% I also sought advice from another 100 disability organisations across the European Union . #% But he also confirmed that in the IGC enlargement would remain at the core , at the heart of the envisaged Treaty reforms and , secondly , that the timetable would be adhered to . #% Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his frank and straightforward statement . #% This House bears some of that responsibility . #% When the Council reviews the decision on duty-free it will no doubt be looking at the problem raised , rightly , by several governments about the need to have a workable successor regime in place . #% What we are looking for here are common sense answers and an answer to the question as to why a Member State can be so long in default and why it is that we , as Parliament , can not get a simple answer to a simple question about that . #% But when you visit Denmark or the Netherlands where electrical and electronic waste is routinely collected , you see that the Commission directive is really only an attempt to harmonise and build on the best practice of the present . #% Our twin reports in Parliament on human rights in the world and human rights in the Union demonstrate the importance we place on this issue . #% This means that risk assessments are currently being carried out by the Member States which have been designated as rapporteurs in this case , namely the Netherlands , Sweden and Norway , Regulation 793/93 being EEA-relevant . #% I spent 35 years as an investment banker , investment manager , investment adviser and economic strategist , and I never bought a dud bank in my life . #% But not all of us in this House have been heroes . #% Next time we are discussing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , let us remember marginal lands and famine in Africa . #% Mr President , the performance of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers causes me great concern too . #% This House should operate properly and within the Rules . #% We had an excellent discussion and debate on 15 November at our last session with the Commissioner and the Secretary-General , who came to show exactly where we had taken lines in reserve and where we could now release them . #% Now I want to touch briefly on the rather shadowy side of globalisation which is typified for me by access to medicines and the clear need for a review of TRIPs . #% - My group is happy to support the Figueiredo report , and congratulates the rapporteur on her dedicated approach to the issue . #% I welcome the progress that has been made and in particular the way that the programme has been managed and has developed . #% Who would willingly stunt his growth or make himself prone to violent or aggressive behaviour ? #% The present unacceptable situation is a clear consequence of mission creep and political indecision and provides a clear lesson for the future . #% As 71 % of the Earth 's surface is covered with water , it really does make sense to try and develop an integrated maritime policy . #% Mr President , I have read all 15 dreary pages of this document and believe it to be a report of the past rather than a document for the future . #% However , our criticisms must always be balanced , fair and honest , recognising achievements as well as shortcomings . #% They must be guaranteed the same employment and civil rights as all people resident in those countries . #% So demand is evident but what is the proper definition of free range or farm laid or perchery eggs ? #% But we must get this done and get it through as soon as we possibly can . #% More recently - and this is the reason for my motion for resolution - it has starved many thousands of its people to death due to its disastrous isolationist economic policies and the fact that it has chosen to maintain one million men under arms with an immoral diversion of food and resources to the military , irrespective of the deprivation suffered by its civilian population . #% We must be vigilant over the next few months and ensure that progress continues to be made on these three items because none of them has been fully resolved in this 2003 budget . #% We also support the call for Member States to refrain from protectionism . #% So Chancellor Kohl wants people to work harder and longer and Mr Rocard wants them to work for shorter periods and less . #% But let me turn to the rights of those sometimes forgotten , namely women , children , minorities , lesbian , gay and trans-gendered people who suffer inhumane and degrading treatment merely because of who they are . #% I have been increasingly puzzled as it has gone on . #% Similarly , we abstained on matters concerning ascending relatives , because , wherever possible , we wish to remove objections so as to secure a clear majority for the report and recognise that the inclusion of such relatives raises particular problems for some Members . #% We would be a friend of anti-Europeanism if we continue to cloak what we do in secrecy . #% It must be in the interests of the consumer , the investor and the company itself that reliance can be placed on the company 's accounts . #% The other -- related -- point I wish to raise is the question of monitoring the system . #% We are also concerned at some of the proposed reforms to the Council 's inner workings - the Development Council , for example , is to be absorbed into a wider grouping . #% In other words , not only are Member States ' civil servants being absorbed into the maw of the Community , but the courts are too . #% Alongside Piet Dankert we have been working to try to make sure that takes place . #% Sweden , Denmark and the UK have not adopted the single currency , so they are not saddled with a single interest rate . #% We want the establishment of a coordinating centre for the monitoring of industrial change as a contribution to a more pro-active approach to the management of medium and longer-term industrial change in terms of its impact within the European Union and I would draw Mr Chichester 's attention to the fact that service industries too are industries and we are looking at industrial change overall . #% The drive to make Europe more competitive does not begin and end with summit conclusions . #% I do not see that we should actually be advocating or allowing an advantage to one particular form of company organisation while , as it were , putting barriers in the way of a different form of organisation . #% So perhaps we are lucky to have Mr Mandelson as the Trade Commissioner ; after all , he is rather more competent than the rest of the shower in the European Commission . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the motion for a resolution to which we are referring in this debate is a perfect example , I have to say , of the European Parliament at its worst . #% It has to be fought by every means , politically , diplomatically , financially , through the engagement of the communities from which terrorists draw their support , through sensible media coverage and through the education of public opinion . #% The risk is that we will drive it underground even further than has been the case . #% I would like to hear the explanations just as Mrs Breyer would but for the opposite reason . #% Legislating in this field of policy is particularly difficult because the technologies involved change and advance so rapidly and so much , which means that we are always playing catch-up rather than legislating ahead of the game . #% I conclude by welcoming once again the strong commitment the EU institutions have shown to promoting human rights and to providing an effective report on EU policy and actions in this area . #% It is important , therefore , certainly with nuclear matters and pollution at sea , that we use those models to carry on with our international obligations and work with our other partners around the world . #% The agricultural policies should be redirected so that they encourage farmers to be more enterprising . #% Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities , groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming . #% These reports highlight their levels of corruption , the proliferation of organised crime , and the need for the reform of their legal and economic systems among many other things . #% Mr President , it concerns the speech made last week by Mr Fischler on BSE and reported in the Minutes . #% We have a system that is going to be operated by the users and the point I want to make this evening in now thinking ahead , because we are confident we are going to get this directive through , is to say to the Commission that we need to have a very comprehensive and a very fast feedback from the users about the problems and issues that they are encountering in using this directive . #% We have reinforced and upheld the principle of freedom of movement for EU citizens and others with a right to reside which , in a Eurobarometer poll , was seen as the single biggest benefit of being in the European Union . #% While we need answers as soon as is reasonable , I would caution against a rush to judgment . #% Unless the Council comes to terms with this proposal , then it is not serious about Lisbon and not serious about the internal market . #% 
He continues `` The explosive growth of markets and economies makes developing such a system an imperative . #% It is all very well for us to wish that people should have a safe and secure pension , but for this to happen , pensions have to be sustainable , the funding has to be put in place . #% Had they thought about Switzerland , who will co-host the European finals in 2008 ? #% The report also looks at the role that the EU should play within the UN . #% We await a new proposal with great interest . #% Yet this year 's work programme , as in all previous years , does not provide detailed justification for each of the multitude of new measures proposed . #% Perhaps the calculation of Mr Bush and others was that Hamas would not win , or that it would significantly modify its rhetoric and policies if brought into the electoral process . #% In order that co-operation is as close as possible , there must be an exchange of personal data of those few who pose a threat to security . #% I thought that was exactly right , and I note that this request is for the creation of 25 posts . #% It is easy for you to try and divert this debate , but it must not be diverted . #% We believe that it is about time that the European Union took a strong political and moral stand against that iniquitous regime , the SLORC in Rangoon . #% I am almost committing a sin by actually mentioning it , but many crops are sprayed and , because of this , they are of a very good quality . #% The position of the Data Protection Supervisor is of enormous importance . #% Scotland , as a whole , has 462 different coastal plans in place , almost three quarters of them locally based . #% The Nice Treaty could have been an opportunity to begin to improve the democracy and transparency of EU trade policy but in fact the Treaty makes these matters worse by increasing the powers of the Commission but not balancing that by increasing the powers of Parliament via the codecision procedure . #% Equally , the use of these products in combination with others , including drugs , requires scrupulous attention to the possible side-effects where they may occur . #% It is increasingly vital that the EU should develop an independent technology from the only two which exist in Russia and the United States . #% On a number of occasions he has asked Members to help him spread the word . #% The PES Group supported this report and congratulates the rapporteur on achieving a wide consensus . #% It acknowledges that the EU should not legislate on the adequacy of pension levels and retirement ages , but asks - and asks very clearly and very strongly - that Member States regulate in accordance with their own circumstances , taking account of those issues . #% In my country we are particularly aware of that , but we believe that the OIE code covers trade in live animals and will protect countries which do not have BSE from introduction of the disease . #% But there are a few that I have a great deal of interest in . #% The only way of dealing with this is to try and adapt it to the realities of the present situation . #% This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria , and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens . #% Its responsibilities have increased with its peace-keeping role and I know from my own experience in Sri Lanka from where I brought thousands of documents about disappeared people , that the United Nations needs more money . #% The difference between our two institutions is that we act as a Parliament should act . #% This must include , as a minimum , an automatic Parliamentary right to subject any WTO deal to assent and much greater access to the negotiating briefs discussed within the Council . #% We share the view of the MSF , which has been critical of the slow response , first by the Government of Niger and then by the UN . #% Today the college unanimously adopted a series of proposals and guidelines for fulfilling those objectives , including guidelines on a new , more linear career system and on pay and pensions . #% All these serious problems are undermining the institutions of international law . #% We are well aware of recent cases of persecution in , for example , Egypt and Jamaica . #% Again , as the noble lady said in her opening remarks , discussions are progressing with Canada for a comprehensive , economic and trade agreement which hopefully will set the standard for future trade agreements between the EU and third countries . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , this report opens by saying ` the various political and security challenges which the European Union is increasingly facing make an autonomous European Space Policy a strategic necessity ' . #% I hope that the next few weeks will see the finalisation of the accession of Cyprus and that we will see this small island , which was once a victim in European politics , becoming an equal , respected and influential voice in shaping the future of our shared continent . #% Freedom , justice , security and transparency before we enlarge is , I am sure many would agree , absolutely crucial . #% This is because the UK was drawn into what was then the EC on the promise that it was not leading to a federal state , but that it was simply about trade . #% If we are aware of the difficulties the Commissioner faced in making any progress on this issue , then we should recognise the very great challenges that lie ahead . #% Madam President , we see how seriously my Party takes matters in this House . #% Finally , can we please sort out the vexed question of the seat of this Parliament once and for all ? #% Does the Commissioner agree that a study might be useful for a purpose other than that for which many have been asking it for , namely , to reassure the public that some of the wilder claims of job losses that will result from the loss of dutyfree are in fact perhaps an exaggeration ? #% At the same time , the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies , notably the same Financial Controller , the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General . '' #% Mr President , firstly I would like to pay tribute to Mr Katiforis for his work for the Greek Presidency within the Convention . #% I hope it secures a common position before the end of December and I hope that this Parliament votes on Thursday in a way that will bring it close to the Presidency 's position . #% The question is : how do we rebuff it ? #% Yet again the British Conservatives voted with great pleasure against another report . #% The other , quite separate tragedy is that since 1999 -- for over five years now -- Bulgarian medical workers have been imprisoned by the Libyan authorities on charges allegedly related to the HIV infection . #% Can you confirm whether or not you have received a letter from Mr Coates ? #% Neither management nor staff have shown any encouragement for this legislation . #% The terrorists were clearly prepared to use all the mechanisms and tools that the global financial system gave them in planning that attack . #% I am very surprised at the Commission 's attitude to the idea that we should now open up the number of species that can be caught in and around Greenland . #% I know it is primarily a national problem , but how do we make sure that organisations can easily access European funding without being put off by the bureaucracy ? #% I thank the President of Parliament for his sympathy . #% If Europe does not stand for human rights then I do not know what it does stand for . #% There are no incentives for the job creation proposals which the Commission and Parliament really wanted . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr van den Bos on his report , but may I state quite categorically that , in addition to freedom of religion , we must be equally committed to freedom of conscience and the freedom , as Mr Gahler said , not to follow any religion . #% Now is the time for us to raise our heads from the minutiae of the convergence criteria . #% In the UK they can not be air traffic controllers , whereas in Greece and Portugal they can . #% It is not in anyone 's interest to prolong the recession , nor is it in anyone 's interest to undermine the credibility of the Pact . #% In those circumstances , one wonders how we can launch this integrated scheme in 1998 . #% Council can not simply continue along the old line that all is well in Romania and that entry in 2007 is the done deal that we have been told it is since Rome last year . #% Mr Bukovsky is quite right , the EU is a form of soft communism . #% I am sure the House would wish her well and a speedy recovery . #% The support provided by the TACIS programme pales beside the financial support provided by international institutions like the IMF which supplied Russia with a # 10.9 bn standby loan . #% That is the challenge facing this Parliament . #% How can they legitimately claim to have a mandate for giving away all this extra taxpayers ' money , most of which will be used to subsidise projects in eastern European countries , at the expense of under-funding our own domestic infrastructure ? #% On the matter of unsolicited commercial e-mail : not all UCE is spam . #% 
We in the Union have to be sure to coordinate everything that is available to us in a financial , political and economic way -- as the President-in-Office of the Council has said for the Turkish side of Cyprus , which is not yet able to join the European Union . #% Other sports have transfer fees and I wonder which other sports you have discussed this with . #% The conference was hijacked by those whose sole objective was to attack the state of Israel and to ignore the fact that it is the one nation in the Middle East based on democracy . #% There are other areas which have been mentioned , such as taxation , double taxation of venture capital or capital gains tax , tax arrangements for new firms and comparative tax rates with less risky forms of capital . #% The Standing Committee has only agreed to vaccination with the proviso that quarantine , slaughter and disposal remain the most effective means of eradicating the disease . #% If we work on this report we will help higher education , the single market and young people to get the employment that they need . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , December 's European Council at least gave us political agreement on a permanent crisis resolution mechanism but - given the reaction of the markets after Christmas , with new fears over the solvency of Portugal , Spain , and Belgium - we have to ask whether , once again , this was a case of ` too little too late ' . #% Furthermore , the dossier tries to broaden ECDC 's mandate and their working relationship with Member States , which is undesirable as it may lead to an increase in their budgetary allowance . #% It would be good if they encouraged more participation in their work within Parliament . #% We have to do something about this transfer of basic food resources . #% Many of the smaller clubs in my region , who cradle players for the obvious talents of the north-west clubs in the UK , are particularly worried about this . #% Of course poor countries need more aid , but they also need better and fairer export opportunities . #% Despite their image of danger , derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance . #% Governments find it easy to sign declarations of intent but harder to put into practice what they profess . #% In the absence of a worldwide agreement , I think we would be crazy to agree to further reductions because what we will do is run the risk of saddling our consumers with some of the highest energy bills in the developed world , making European heavy industry and large energy consumers particularly uncompetitive in a worldwide environment . #% Last Friday , I was at the New and Renewable Energy Centre in Blyth in Northumberland , where innovative research is going on to reduce the cost of solar electricity by focusing the sun 's rays on very small silicon cells . #% A feasible scenario is that , in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 , understandably keen to offer help to the US in tracking down the perpetrators of that abominable crime , European governments offered intelligence help and facilities to their US ally . #% Mr Fantuzzi 's report on the marketing of EU produce to third countries , mirroring similar schemes within the EU , is one such instance which could assist . #% We must stop that institutional debate , because it is vital for the political legitimacy of the EU that we come to an agreement in this IGC quickly but , more importantly , that we come to an agreement that will stick . #% Unfortunately , we do not get that kind of progress inside the Council of Ministers and I know very well why that is so . #% We seem to be continually rotating and it is often difficult for Members to find their seats . #% Two years ago , along with many colleagues , I found myself sitting in this very Chamber , having this very same debate , where a very similar proposal was rejected . #% The Commission 's second report on citizenship is therefore an important plank in building a corps d'esprit and a sense of European belonging . #% Those troops are required as soon as possible . #% I am surprised that no-one from the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reform Party , that tabled three amendments to this report , has spoken in this debate . #% Only this weekend there are reports from scientists in such places as the Dutch Institute of Science and Health and T√ºbingen University , which throw grave doubts on the figures coming from other European countries . #% I affirm that fiscal policy is exclusively a matter for individual Member States . #% I also ask you to promise us that the error rate will improve . #% Let us challenge them strongly . #% I believe they are willing to have dialogue with us on a number of specific issues . #% A marketing ban has to be introduced , pressure has to be put on industry to ensure that new alternatives are developed . #% These four reports before us today deal with some of the last-minute anxieties and hopes . #% Conciliation , Mr Papayannakis , does not take very long . #% I should also like to ask him whether he would agree that banning the senior generals and others from entering the EU is only as successful as the policies of individual Member States . #% We have some problems over the envisaged greater role for the Commission and there are also complications about the legal situation that it proposes as far as the UK is concerned . #% The anti-Europeans have to understand that it will sometimes act in the sense of constraining the EU institutions and giving redress against abuse of powers by them . #% The percentage of people living in poverty in Europe increased from 16 % to 17 % between 2005 and 2008 . #% There is much we can learn about how we could better support our own innovative small businesses in Europe . #% We as Conservatives believe in choice and , with choice , flexibility for women and subsequently equality . #% I really would ask the Commissioner when he replies to the debate to take this opportunity to clarify as publicly as possible why the European Commission has chosen the 1 % level . #% Nothing could better illustrate the illiteracy of EU economics . #% Mr Corbett quoted Chairman Mao . #% In this respect , I am very proud of the fact that London has led the way with a number of initiatives , be it the congestion charge , the new low-emission zone or higher charges for less environmentally friendly vehicles , something which had been opposed by London 's Conservatives . #% And we need to equalise the treatment of race , gender and sexual orientation in generalising the ban on discrimination not only in the workplace , but also in the receipt of services and in the supply of goods . #% You are going to look into it but I am not sure how if you do not actually know who is here so that you can compare them with who has made an explanation of vote . #% Democracy is the ideal form of government that enables the full consent of the peoples involved . #% The House will be conscious that , in the context of the Middle East peace process and the Oslo peace accords , the refugee issue was specified for final status talks . #% I do not want to reiterate what has already been said today but I should like to mention to the President-in-Office one of the points he mentioned : the WTO . #% No doubt when the ailing tyrant finally passes away many in this House will sing his praises as the historic father of the nation , as they have recently done sycophantically on the death of President Arafat . #% In this we were simply holding the Commission to a principle which it supported in theory , but must now deliver in practice by 2003 . #% The European Commission aspires to be an EU government of sorts . #% Mrs Fourtou ' s report is valuable because it provides an important gloss on the Commission ' s green paper ` Combating counterfeiting and piracy in the single market ' . #% I hope that the summit at Visby will take place in a spirit of positive , but realistic cooperation . #% Unlike Mr Poos , I do not see Mr Schr√∂der as my spokesman . #% The reason I say that is because I hope he is still discussing with his colleagues what approach to take to arbitration on 25 September . #% We must work together , because in my view , although we imparted the process of democracy , we did not impart the values of democracy that we are so used to in the European Union . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Swoboda for his speech and also the report . #% We encourage the Commission and the Council to get the remaining bits of that legislation to us as quickly as possible because that is what Europe needs . #% So my message to the leaders for the June summit has to be simple : they should focus on people 's priorities , particularly the plight of the 18 million who have no job in the Union . #% Very many fishermen , all over the EU , from communities like Grimsby in my own constituency , have become unemployed as a result of conservation measures . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question as an MEP who actually attended the summit in Geneva and was therefore able to see the extensive engagement on the floor of the conference by members of civil society , which I thought was very helpful . #% I just wish to say that had I been able to speak to your last comments , I would have very much welcomed them - they were very good indeed and I was delighted to hear that . #% We in the European Parliament offer our full support to the Commission and to the presidency in their endeavours to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol survives and comes into force . #% If such a request were received , it would be considered through the normal procedure . #% There was no immediate security problem , there were no demonstrators in sight , but the French police refused us admittance to the building . #% Where were the checks and the monitoring ? #% 
I therefore leave you and ask you to consider very carefully this question : can you really suppose that hard-pressed European taxpayers and UK taxpayers , especially in today 's environment , really want an extra EUR 2 billion to be spent - because that is what these proposals provide for - just so that the EU Commissioner can strut about on the world stage ? #% On the contrary , I , like Mr Blokland , have a stack of letters which testify that many do a great deal of good . #% Reservations are clearly that Parliament has almost no role in CFSP . #% In one of those areas we need to look at the relationship between that and the World Trade Organisation agreements and proposals we are currently following , and to see whether we will be able to safeguard social and environmental rights within the European Union and encourage and support such development in poorer countries under the current regime . #% We left a clear mark , on behalf of Parliament , on the final text - a text which , thanks to Parliament , goes beyond the mere technical and legal , bringing private international law into the open to serve the practical needs of our citizens , particularly in the area of road traffic accidents . #% But also there will be the power to detain , in particular the power to detain ships which , by 2008 , do not have a fully functioning voice data recorder , a black box . #% I would like to believe that it is genuinely about providing universal high-quality care in a variety of situations and circumstances , but that is certainly not the tone of the debate as it often comes across in a number of our Member States , where it seems to be all about how we can cut costs and find the money to make provisions . #% Indeed , if a European citizen has problems with food safety only to find that there is an exemption for the particular meat in question , it could render this whole package of measures meaningless . #% Would it not be appropriate for us to extend its mandate to Burundi ? #% That is why the Committee on Development and Cooperation did not vote to postpone discharge for the European Development Fund . #% I understand that a meeting will take place tomorrow between the Commission and the unions in Brussels . #% Not everyone agreed with me but I still believe that . #% From my own experience , the first tailings dams I ever saw were in Derbyshire in the north of England , and they were the result of the mining of fluorospa , not a metal as any chemistry teacher will tell you . #% We now have the mechanism in place for a growing partnership between the EU and the Republic of Korea . #% It is , then , an aspiration , an attempt at founding an embryonic culture . #% Mr President , all of us want to see less poverty and more social justice . #% In other words , being an official does not exempt you from prosecution . #% We also call on all states participating at the Donor Conference for Burundi to make sure there are sufficient funds for human rights promotion and protection . #% The fact of the matter is that the Commission has created a situation , by bringing forward the directive in this form , that has given people reason to voice and to have such fears . #% The next point of contention has been over sovereignty . #% Firstly , he confirmed the continued cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament and his forthcoming visit to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs . #% We must also be consistent about our attitude to women . #% This will be of enormous benefit to us all . #% Firstly , from a procedural point of view , while I realise it is due to unavoidable delays on the part of this Parliament , it is unacceptable that , as Mr S√∏rensen said , the Council has already reached its general agreement on this without waiting for Parliament 's opinion . #% We reject the claim of biosecurity lapses because there was no evidence of the spread of infection from carcasses being moved or by official personnel . #% It is little wonder that , whereas the English version of the text of the March summit referred to ` governance ' , which is what the Commission has also referred to , the French version referred to ` government ' . #% This is going to be very painful for all fishermen , because it will mean that there will be many reductions in the catch and many job losses . #% How representative of European opinion are Val√©ry Giscard D'Estaing , Dehaene and Amato ? #% It seems to me that , in Europe , we have a wonderful opportunity to look around and see what exactly best serves the public interest . #% Lastly , on the subject of fiscal measures . #% Whilst a lot of countries are keen to see their citizens benefit from the good things it can offer and whilst e-commerce itself is becoming a major feature of life , we have not yet seen any proper regulations to protect those who are abused , and particularly those who are abused by the use of images of themselves in a pornographic manner . #% I applaud the fact that new initiatives will be encouraged by this programme , ensuring that traffic is phased into junctions by using light-emitting diodes etc. , things which are cheap but which are very effective and absolutely vital . #% The 15 Member States , and certainly the 11 that will join the single currency , have proved the doubters wrong and it is a testimony to what can be achieved in the European Union when the political will exists for us to work together as a Community . #% In launching this debate , it is our view that our discussions would have been more fruitful and more meaningful if the Commission had come forward with ideas of its own so that it could act as a facilitator of those discussions . #% Bearing in mind that many Member States - I am thinking particularly of Finland here - have thousands of small boats on very remote and inaccessible lakes , when and if it brings forward proposals for a system of in-use compliance testing , I hope that the Commission will bear in mind the difficulty of implementing them in many Member States . #% I feel genuinely sorry that it has been put in a situation where it has had to make a proposal on this matter . #% The governments of Denmark and the United Kingdom should revoke the asylum status of Mr Ferzaouli and Mr Zakayev . #% In some parts of Nigeria , up to 84 % of protein is obtained from bushmeat , which plays a significant part in people 's lives . #% It is important that the Commission shows how this is to be done . #% Indeed , a Commission official is recently quoted as saying : ` given the recent experience in France and the Netherlands concerning referendums , we would not advise anyone to organise one ' . #% It is important that the break periods be simple and easy to understand and that a degree in mathematics is not required to apply them ! #% I note with approval too that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy have adopted all but one of the amendments of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy . #% I welcome President Obama 's initiative in this regard . #% In adding new issues like those to the IGC we are not necessarily making it more difficult . #% Sustainable development is about creating a world in which there are no losers . #% It should be continued in its present form and we should not extend it beyond its current boundaries . #% I am baffled for instance by the idea that the fight against gender discrimination would fall into the crisis management category , triggering the use of the rapid reaction facility . #% We should note in this Chamber today that the Commission on our behalf did not have the confidence that they could do an independent , fair and objective job and therefore we have proper reason to say that we have no confidence in the election results . #% I do , however , remain concerned about two points . #% I am sorry that Mr Farage has left . #% The Council is absent - that is shameful ! #% Therefore it is important that the Commission and Council press both countries to return to the troop deployment levels of 16 December 2004 , and for Eritrea in particular to reverse its decision to ban helicopter flights by the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea and to ask some members of the Mission to leave . #% Mr President , I understand the frustration of my colleagues . #% Among those Member States I am told that Spain , Belgium , Germany , France and perhaps Italy have said that whatever it says in the IIA about giving annual statements , they will not be doing it . #% Thirdly , I agree with the comment already made about this being too diverse a joint debate . #% The proposals are unnecessary and will impose yet more administrative and cost burdens on innovative companies . #% Clearly commitments made a decade ago have not materialised . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate our rapporteur , the chairman of the committee , for having dealt with such a complex issue and brought us together around a compromise position which , on all but one or two little details which still need to be settled , can command the overwhelming majority of this House . #% It may be that Member States have cards up their sleeves which they are prepared to offer up if pushed in conciliation . #% This not only exposes the absurdity of Russia 's membership of the Council of Europe , but also encapsulates why the Council of Europe is , in my view , increasingly ignored internationally . #% That creates for us many managerial challenges at EU level and it is here that we , as an institution , must do all that we can to empower our entrepreneurs with knowledge so that they may continue to compete and lead the field in our areas of expertise . #% The comment has already been made by Mrs Palacio and Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn that they would have preferred a recommendation rather than a directive . #% It must not become a free licence for the retention of data by governments or their agencies . #% Christian groups have been critical of the Nigerian Government 's failure to affirm that such punishments are contrary to the federal constitution , although President Obasanjo has said that he will weep if the verdict is carried out . #% All we need is the mutual recognition of national qualifications , possibly underpinned by a loose framework directive , to ensure minimum standards , especially with regard to third-country nationals . #% By the end of 2003 at the latest , the national parliaments should then be able to ratify either the relevant provisions of the Nice Treaty or those of the convention . #% 
What if it contained some outrageous things that would not be acceptable to this Parliament representing the citizens ? #% Most of the chemicals involved are amongst the substances identified as priorities by Regulation 793/93 on evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances . #% There must be a way to stop discarding healthy fish , because the stocks are not there and we must make sure that they are built up again . #% I know that one of his colleagues , Mr Bangemann , said about Alicante that we must be vigilant . #% For the South African trade agreement this is obviously good news , but I have two possible problems to raise about one of the difficult or contentious subjects to which both he and Mrs Kinnock refer . #% Another concern , which is mentioned in the report - and I am very pleased about that - is the continuing existence of the Guant√°namo Bay detention camp , an issue we have raised many times over the last year . #% Under the Commission proposal they would have to resign their contracts for each of these credit cards . #% The publican - the manager of the public house - was told by his local environmental health officer that he could no longer serve underdone beef . #% Given the cut in the original budget proposed and my own experience of the cost and ineffectiveness of the Handinet European Database in relation to disability , I question whether it is a good use of the limited budget to spend so much on the database and only ECU 0.2 million in the first year for support groups . #% This is not the right way to run a chamber that is supposed to be having a serious debate on these subjects . #% If the promised referendum looks unwinnable it is cancelled without apparent shame or embarrassment . #% Filtering in itself will be for the responsible people who know a great deal about this system . #% The President-in-Office might be interested to know that there is a thing called the ` Duty-Free Intergroup ' , which is simply an organization of the lobby , and that there are some very powerful vested interests involved in this . #% This is one small part of that process . #% If we want builders who can construct energy-efficient buildings , we need to train them . #% As you can see , Commissioner , this is a customdesigned soft bull bar far more resilient than the old type of bull bar . #% Why should we therefore bail out the Sabenas and the Aer Linguses with their overcapacity , with too many routes , too few passengers and too much state pride ? #% The environment and climate in the far north is important to European solidarity . #% We have seen that time and time again with so-called European projects . #% At the same time it is apparent on the basis of credible indications that gross human rights abuses have taken place in the name of fighting terrorism -- the so-called war on terror . #% We want the availability of medicinal products for citizens throughout the European Union . #% The rapporteur has worked particularly well with the initiator of policy and legislation in the European Commission . #% LEADER programmes have already demonstrated great success in generating additional finance for investment in such jobs . #% If a visa system did help to curb the influx of illegal migrants through Morocco 's southern and eastern borders the Commission could look favourably at supporting Moroccan initiatives for introducing such arrangements . #% Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment ? #% This is something that the Commission and many in this House would like to see . #% The Treaty of Rome speaks of the regions , and their significance is becoming more and more apparent . #% This report is a breakthrough and should be supported by all those who wish this institution well and who subscribe to the principles of transparency and accountability . #% Under these proposals , people who wish to migrate to Britain illegally may come to another EU state perfectly legally , obtain a long-stay visa that gets them to France , for example , from where they may gain illegal entry into Britain . #% My dismay is that this was not resolved before the first meeting , because this group only meets every three months and the crucial agenda-setting and design of two years ' work will now have taken place without Members of this House sitting round the table . #% For instance , we still have no agreement with the Council or the Commission on how the EUR 27 million in Category 2 for the fisheries reconstruction programme will be found . #% We will offer them friendly encouragement to do so , but we know the risks . #% We should not forget the progress that is being made in Somaliland : charity maternity hospitals are being built and opened , and there is a nurse training school . #% Mr President , this Parliament has a very good record as a strong supporter of the peace process in Northern Ireland and , indeed , we were strong backers of the peace fund for Northern Ireland . #% However , better engagement and cooperation with Belarus in areas of common interest is essential to encourage reform in that country . #% Drugs , for example , are wasted if not accompanied by adequate storage , distribution , monitoring and patient education . #% There is a question of what should we do , and what we can do , at a European level . #% I hope we are nearing the final chapters in this long saga and that soon we will have all sectors covered by arrangements on working time to protect worker health and safety . #% In the area of rail freight , the rail industry is presently sitting in the ` last chance saloon ' . #% As has been said , the Ogadeni Somali community led to a war between Somalia and Ethiopia in an attempt to reunite the Somali peoples . #% The reason for our debate is , as the Joint Resolution says , that the measures taken by the UK government to control this disease have failed , that new outbreaks are appearing and that there is a very real risk of the disease spreading again to mainland Europe . #% A local campaign in my constituency , organised by Herbert Styles , tried to persuade governments to do more by formally recognising International Workers ' Memorial Day . #% Mr Barroso used it , Mr Van Rompuy used it : ` stability ' . #% We have the Millennium Development Goals and many statements of good intent by governments and parliaments around the world , but unfortunately there is still a huge gap between the rhetoric and the reality on the ground . #% It is clearly important that we keep stating and restating that case . #% Regime change is the only way to ensure a disarmed and peaceful Iraq and prevent ongoing brutalisation of its people by the Butcher of Baghdad . #% This new proposal will bring not only tangible benefits in the IDA way , it will also bring benefits to European citizens and businesses . #% We want to congratulate the Nobel Peace Prize Committee for its courage in making this award . #% Firstly the economic objectives : the development of ports and port infrastructure and short sea shipping would actually work well towards fulfilling our objective of assisting Ireland and the peripheral areas . #% EPLP Members voted in accordance with this approach , reflecting our concerns over the following areas : #% There are said to be several thousand of these , and the full effect of applying the controls outlined in the directive would be to put up the costs for each incinerator to operate by an estimated # 200 000 . #% The Council and Commission have made it quite clear that there will be no new money next year in Category 1 . #% It concerned a German national who had an accident in Turkey , caused by a UK national . #% However , whatever we do in terms of employment , it is of little use to disabled people unless they have access to the built environment or to transport facilities . #% As a new Commission , we would like to take a short time to look at the situation and your amendments , in order to be as sure as we can be that we get things right . #% We have secured greater changes and a more ambitious directive than we could reasonably have expected when the draft was first proposed . #% At the end of the day there is no time limit on the contamination of the environment . #% Operators should have the responsibility for training , but this should be done on a harmonised basis , with a distinct , uniform , European-wide certification system which would be accepted by all Member States . #% I would just like to respond that you have , in fact , answered the question yourself and you know precisely the reason why the United Kingdom does not want to be involved in this area . #% However , I am very conscious of the need to ensure that we secure cross-party support , if the powers of this House to improve environment legislation are to be brought to bear . #% The Council Presidency must not be distracted by calls for the preservation of the completely outdated ` European Social Model ' . #% It is a triumph of hope over experience . #% The European Parliament 's first reading was back in June 2003 , so one preliminary question I have is why has the Council not made more progress ? #% The time commitment for training required of the individual owner-operator is unsustainable and will drive hundreds out of business . #% We welcome the Commission 's participation in that . #% The Commission has partly conceded this case with its proposals to buy back quota , give support to producers to change to other crops and other activities and its encouragement of production of tobacco types which can command a reasonable market price . #% 
But we need more than words . #% Equality between Parliament and Council is the key to this . #% Mr President , a few years ago discharges in this House used to be perfunctory debates , certainly not held on Tuesday mornings . #% We also need to monitor all foodstocks that are held in the world , both public foodstocks and private foodstocks . #% A very important message will be going out from this Parliament . #% We believe that NATO should be the international organisation of first resort , not just for collective defence , but for all relevant crisis management tasks requiring the use of military assets . #% The silence of Mr. Barroso , on the very central and direct question on the Latsis Group and the EU relations , no doubt proves there are no longer business links between them . #% BP denies those allegations , it blames local people for inflicting environmental damage - so did Shell in Nigeria . #% On the issue of sludge , could I ask the Commissioner to clarify the situation ? #% Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice ? #% First , Amendment No 3 : the need to avoid contradictions between the EU policy to combat the drugs trade and those of the World Bank and the other financial institutions . #% This measure , however , will help allow small businesses to fight back . #% It is , therefore , highly unrealistic to believe that there is a future for industry as a whole while we neglect its link to its customers : the road network . #% However , in reality , the chances are very small , as President Lukashenko , since his election in 1994 , has turned his country into a self-isolated police state and a sham democracy . #% So I welcome giving emphasis to them in this report . #% His report shows that the Assembly has grown in maturity over the last few years . #% Mr President , I would like to start by echoing the point made by Minister Roche in his introduction that it is to the European Union 's enormous credit that we can produce this critical self-appraisal , this report on human rights within the EU . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by saying immediately on behalf of my Group that we accept the compromise that has been so skilfully negotiated between the rapporteur , the Greek Presidency and the Commission on this text . #% That affected only a few unfortunate individuals , but almost everyone in Britain drives a car . #% One hundred and fifty Ugandan shillings are what a grower gets for a kilo of the coffee he grows . #% This called for Commission officials responsible for non-payment in due time to be named in the official Parliamentary record after a three-week deadline . #% The Socialist Group appreciates that eventually the Commission will use its good offices to ensure that representatives from the small islands are admitted to that appeals panel . #% We also need to consider , both inside and outside the Convention , to what extent health care and general care are services of general interest and whether universal and affordable access should be guaranteed in the Treaties of the European Union . #% Mr President , I rise to confirm what has just been said by Mr Teverson . #% I welcome the peacekeeping force . #% When they see a budget of EUR 965m , the newspapers will easily deduce that is over EUR 1.5 m per Member . #% But its promise has not been properly fulfilled as former allies fall out and corruption is found within the ranks of those promising to sweep it away . #% Surely , to subsidise your economic competitors is the economics of the madhouse ! #% Mr President , a fiscal responsibility for Member States is a must , inside or outside the eurozone . #% We can do more . #% This has been communicated to Parliament but of course because Parliament rose at roughly the time we were producing that document , there was not an opportunity to formally bring it before Parliament at that juncture . #% This is why we need an annual report on this issue . #% We also need to think about the new products that will allow wireless technology to carry things like video broadcasts , access to streamed broadcasts that could be passing through and around us : how , for example , could we access our local television station wherever we are in the world , and how would we pay for that ? #% Mr President , we are now in a very difficult position on this report . #% If that average has to be 1 % , then there will be years when we will have to exceed 1 % quite significantly . #% In states such as Tunisia , it may seem an achievement merely to resist the kind of radical socialism or Islamicism that has blighted the lives of so many in the Arab world in recent decades . #% We have a big challenge to show that we in the European Union and the Member States are taking seriously the need to apply and extend the benefits of information and communications technology to the developing world . #% However , I also want to make it clear that we are concerned about some recent developments and emphasise the need for President Barroso not to weaken his stance on EU market liberalisation by in any way undermining the Services Directive , which is a fundamental part of the Lisbon Agenda that he himself redefined only recently . #% Why does this Parliament not contact some of these museums and say that we can provide large spaces of wall on which some of these pictures could be displayed . #% The two previous speakers would seem to accept the opposite . #% Secondly , it has been admitted by one of the operators in the United Kingdom that the ending of tax-free sales would mean an extra # 15 on the average charter air fare . #% I plead with the Commissioner to make sure that sort of legislation is in place , so that we do not have products coming into the European Union which are not of the same standard that we set . #% And it works just fine . #% We and the Commission must be able to justify a sustainable development of health policy priorities within a very clear framework to avoid accusations of emotional attachment and vested interest . #% . -- Mr President , the strength of one 's commitment to gender equality should not be measured by support for the establishment of a Gender Institute . #% But would you , Commissioner , also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you , with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress ? #% Put any two Members together and very soon they will start discussing departure lounges and airline schedules . #% So , I urge you , be bold and be ambitious . #% There can be no doubt that President Karimov has ruled in an authoritarian way and human rights abuses have been common , particularly against the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan , a close ally of the then Taliban in Afghanistan but now largely defeated or replaced by the nominally peaceful , although still fundamentalist , Hizb ut-Tahrir , which rather surprisingly has offices in the European Union to gather funds and recruit supporters . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I should like to congratulate both Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Kindermann for their work . #% Mr President , it is no secret that the Green/EFA Group does not share the majority view of Parliament over the outcome of the Doha meeting . #% After the first reading of the Langen report , the Financial Times of 31 January 1996 accused the European Parliament of being the lapdogs of industrial lobbyists . #% We also have made a commitment , in the Fajon report , to working for a visa facilitation and visa liberalisation road map for Kosovo similar to those for the other Western Balkan countries . #% The first reform will calm citizens ' fears of creeping sovereignty transfers and the second should encourage citizens to engage more obviously with the political choices that we face in Brussels and in Strasbourg . #% More must be done if he is to have credibility in the fight against international terrorism . #% It is not what the Commission worked for many years . #% You could not buy a ticket by telephoning and paying FF500 , but for FF5 , 000 you could get the same ticket and the equivalent of a school dinner - I have had corporate hospitality before . #% Stop it now , please . #% I also think it is not conducive to increased efficiency or effectiveness . #% While I welcome the fact they are here to make the statement , I am disappointed in its content . #% I started my working life in the Longbridge plant that you have been talking about . #% Yet during the Bush-Gore debates just over a decade ago , George Bush said that had he been President he would not have intervened in Kosovo . #% I was given the opportunity to visit young farmers in five Member States which gave me a better and wider understanding of the practical ways in which young farmers could be helped in the industry . #% Mr President , I think those of you who know me in this House , will know that I am not one to make a fuss . #% Mr President , it is truly wonderful to know that enlargement is so well on track and that common agricultural policy reform will not hold up the entry of the fast track ten . #% Could he assure us , first of all , that the Competitiveness Council is taking an active role in looking at Commission proposals that fundamentally undermine Europe 's competitiveness , particularly in the fields of chemicals policy , for example ? #% 
However , this report could not be supported because the implementation of EU practices and policies has in many cases resulted in the impoverishment of developing countries . #% Secondly , there is little point in the Commission conducting its impact assessments if parliamentary and Council amendments then escape impact assessments altogether . #% The political , social and economic crises have all worsened in the last four years . #% In my country , the UK , products include vegetables , fruit , cereals , poultry , fish , shellfish - not too many frogs ' legs ! #% Is n't it a rather wonderful organisation for giving retired , clapped-out ex-premiers some real executive power ? #% There is I think one final reason why the Commission should be supported . #% Here , we believe the United Kingdom should be driven by the ethos of being a `` good neighbour '' , respecting the rights and independence of other nation-states and taking a responsible role in the global community . #% His characteristic eloquence will be sadly missed on all sides of this House . #% And , allied to that , we would like to know from the Commission what national barriers and loopholes are currently halting progress on interoperability , and which Member States are the most obstructive . #% We have two reports concerning the treatment and transport of animals : that will be a very familiar subject for the Commissioner . #% It is essential that the Irish Prime Minister and the incoming Dutch presidency honour that agreement . #% in writing . - British Conservative MEPs are in favour of equality of treatment and access for men and women in all aspects of society , including the performing arts . #% This matter can only get worse with the proliferation of mini-States in the western Balkans -- as recently seen with the independence of Montenegro -- all of which are likely to become full Members in the next ten years . #% If , over the Christmas holidays , you are in the wonderful city of Bolton , please come and join me in a visit to my local pub because you will surprised to discover that most people there are not talking about qualified majority voting , the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Intergovernmental Conference . #% It is in a sense a proposal that comes as much from this House as from the other institutions of the European Union because our two temporary committees of inquiry culminated in the recommendation that there should be a body of this kind . #% I congratulate him on his efforts and hope that we will make future progress on the outstanding matters within an appropriate timescale . #% I must emphasise that I am saying this not to gainsay the quality of the rapporteur 's work or to underestimate the effort he has put in . #% I would also like to thank my colleagues for their outstanding cooperation in bringing us to the point of tomorrow 's vote ; shadows and staff have truly pulled out all the stops so that we could complete Parliament 's first reading in the shortest possible time , so as to be in a position to seek a first-reading agreement and thus to avoid any further delays . #% Finally , I am pleased that we have a section in the report on disabled peoples ' rights . #% Yet this pointless war also carries on , to serve the single purpose of a terrorist leader pursuing his own ambition . #% For instance , there did not appear to be a coherent plan for dealing with the enormous volume of material disgorged into the compilation centres -- some of it sensitive material , some of it not . #% We have come up with a compromise stating that explanatory statements must , where there are expected financial implications , contain an analysis as to how this is compatible with the financial perspective . #% The role of the audiovisual sector as a whole in fostering the development of civil society , in particular in the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe , is crucial . #% Recital V shows that this is already happening . #% London is the world 's leading financial centre and English is the common business language of the world . #% However , two problems emerge from this situation . #% I am studying the matter . #% Worries centre on whether what ought to be the basis of good human health - our food - is actually contributing to ill-health through overuse of pesticides , herbicides , artificial fertilizers , artificial hormones , routine use of antibiotics and inappropriate animal feeds . #% However , I welcome China 's cooperation in the fight against international terrorism and its rapprochement with India , whose territory it still occupies , having traditionally been an ally of Pakistan , whose atom bomb it helped to build . #% We have seen , as both Commissioners have said , a paralysis , a callous indifference , and we have seen a lack of moral or political leadership in the world . #% We need to value this mechanism and use the experience of the people we represent , as expressed through their petitions to improve our work as a whole . #% It is also vital to ensure that workers are protected from cancer-causing substances - around 8 % of all cancers are caused by exposure to carcinogens at work - and we need binding limits on crystalline silica , which can cause disabling illness and fatal lung disease . #% UEFA were requiring the Premier League in England be reduced from 20 clubs down to 18 . #% But unless the EU agrees to the long-term possibility of eventual EU membership for that delightful country , it is inevitable that whoever wins has only one economic option : to look east to Moscow . #% I would like to see some statement of principle , some criterion , some yardstick by which this could be measured because I would like to think that the public money - the taxpayers ' money - which will be spent on mine-clearance will be placed only with those companies who could guarantee , according to a statement of principles , that it would be spent properly , efficiently , wisely , and so on . #% For example , climate change , if unchecked , is certainly destabilising to anybody ' s economy as the European Union ' s own research shows . #% Mr Wiebenga has added some useful , strengthening amendments to the clause already in the Commission proposal : for instance , on insisting on non-refoulement , to insist that the Dublin Convention shall not apply and that the host Member State shall consider the asylum application , and on the involvement of UNHCR . #% This will not protect consumers in Europe , because the meat will still be imported . #% Minimum amounts insured are out of date and this figure is a much more realistic sum . #% Also , we should stress that the CEPT , whilst it has made good progress in harmonizing the role of Member States to some degree , does not have all the answers . #% I hope those points will be borne in mind when you look at the practicality of getting the package through . #% It deals with the maintenance of the equipment , but in this incident a young child nearly had a very serious accident because he fell through the glass . #% Some excellent and innovative local campaigns against violence could have a wider impact on the European stage . #% As Winston Churchill said 60 years ago : ` We are either with the American people , we are part of them , or we are not ' . #% I have reservations about the proposal that we should move to a directive at this point . #% Therefore , I hope he will give attention to the results of the studies I mentioned being undertaken at the moment by the Commission , both in terms of the general questions he raised when he submitted his question and also in terms of the relative fortunes of big producers and small producers . #% I should be very glad to hear whether the Commissioner feels he can accept that in some circumstances - particularly in view of the over-30-month cull in the United Kingdom - for those countries which are admittedly very high risk but also with a very high level of precaution now in place a certain number of derogations are necessary and would be satisfactory to him . #% They are community clubs and there are also jobs at stake as well . #% However , we do have serious misgivings on the issue of the reversal of the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the accused . #% Her appointment is an embarrassment for Britain . #% We believe it significantly alters the balance of power between Member States and the European Union institutions . #% I was on my own apart from one notable exception so I appreciate the vote tomorrow will not make any difference at all to the final outcome . #% Members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission have worked well to develop a meaningful and practical report which will deliver more transparency in the legislative process . #% When we bear in mind the importance of Japan as a trading partner - with bilateral trade with the EU standing at EUR 120 billion a year , and with the EU being the number three trading partner for Japan and the number two investor in Japan - I think we recognise that any bilateral agreement runs the risk of undermining multilateral agreements with the rest of the world and , in particular , with the developing countries . #% Naturally , the situation in Belarus still remains serious , but we need to recognise that one way of coaxing Belarus towards the European Union is to recognise and respond to Mr Lukashenko 's overtures . #% Europe has 18 million unemployed and while 10 % of the unemployed in the US have been unemployed for more than a year , nearly 50 % of Europe 's unemployed are long-term unemployed . #% It was Mr Linkhorst 's suggestion , as one of the other members of the delegation , that rather than going straight to a debate in plenary we should attempt to have a discussion in at least the three committees most clearly responsible , draft a careful resolution and come back either in December and January . #% On top of the extension of powers over justice and home affairs , the establishment of EU visas , everything down to regulations on children 's toys , I notice that on the budget you say that there must be adequate audit and control systems . #% Mr President , I agree with a lot of what has been said so far . #% I would like to see a legitimate international forum where developing countries can be included and where international institutions like UNCTAD can be involved . #% We need to be very clear about that . #% I hope Mr Gawronski and his friends are knocking on the doors of those national capitals which have not implemented the framework decision on terrorism . #% We need the basic services that are there , but we also need quality , which it refers to as well , and we particularly need affordability , given the problems we face here in the European Union with social exclusion . #% It is also necessary to ensure that suitable risk management schemes are in place so that if there is a problem with one service there is no contagion between the so-called core services and value-added services . #% If this Belgian Presidency is anything like the last Belgian Presidency when I did the 1994 budget , I will be extremely happy . #% The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme . #% 
Parliament must therefore put political pressure on the Presidency to negotiate and it may be that we will have to negotiate without the Commission . #% I also wanted to bring in children with learning difficulties . #% I hope it will also help stop ` gold-plating ' of EU directives , which some governments are rather prone to . #% The evolution of those discussions has , in part , taken in Commissioner Kinnock 's reform programme and the White Paper on Governance from Mr Prodi . #% Instead of examining new , flexible and radical approaches to an enlarged Union in the global market , the message of this report is : carry on regardless down the road from Maastricht and Amsterdam ! #% That is why we should not be too prescriptive regarding the issues of biometric risks or investment strategies . #% It does give me the opportunity to thank all the shadow rapporteurs whom I did not thank before ; also to again thank Stephen Hughes , because it was Stephen and I in 2004 that actually went round the hospitals with John Bowis , who was a Conservative MEP . #% Let us at least agree on that . #% You did not respond to either . #% Madam President , when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view , I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning , as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue , it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States . #% That must change , and I believe it will . #% Serious concerns remain over child labour and the spread of HIV/AIDS has a potential to disrupt India 's progress . #% Therefore , I would like to ask you whether you heard - as I know you did - the clear warning we had last week at the opening of the negotiations given by Minister Billie Miller from Barbados , maintaining that ACP economies are far too fragile to withstand any kind of asymmetrical deal with the European Union ? #% Whereas sexism and racism are well-known terms , disability discrimination is barely referred to in public discourse . #% Yet , we find the Socialist Group wants to delete paragraph 12 . #% We must open up our markets . #% This involved civil proceedings between Mr Bossi and another Italian politician . #% I conclude with a stark fact : billions of euros are still in the Commission 's coffers , without a chance of being spent . #% In the meantime , let us not be deterred from confronting a dangerous menace when we can . #% It was a request for you to refer this to the Constitutional Affairs Committee . #% Political movements that we see within the European Union could well mean that we will be unable to proceed if we miss the Copenhagen Summit deadline . #% Mr President , today is a happy day for Egypt because , for the first time in a generation , the Egyptian people have an opportunity to vote for a president and have a choice in that vote . #% We can not support the sudden suggestion to make CSR -- corporate social responsibility -- compulsory . #% In other words , the system of honorary Members will no longer exist . #% That world has gone ! #% Mr President , you will perhaps be aware of the serious allegation on the front page of today 's newspaper that the British Government tried to muzzle its own top scientific adviser when he warned that global warming was a more serious threat than international terrorism . #% Our advantage is that we are not Japan or the United States and we can act as honest brokers in this most dangerous area of the world . #% It is thanks to the breaking of national monopolies that there are now such unparalleled opportunities , mainly for the middle class , to enjoy holidays abroad . #% After all , only by encouraging the 15 railway companies to work together can some of the artificial national barriers to free movement be removed . #% That must be right . #% These measures would do much to foster a culture of transparency . #% UKIP therefore voted against the resolution as a whole , especially as it is without legislative impact . #% He has wanted to change the attitude of the Arab peoples to Israel , but by his own actions has helped stimulate primeval hatred in yet another generation of Palestinians and fuelled the martyr culture . #% So we need to put in place systems that will guarantee that public confidence . #% Is it not time other Member States followed the initiative undertaken by Britain , that has at least outlawed trade promotion in Burma ? #% The outgoing Commission stood on collegiate responsibility . #% Canada is an important potential trading partner for the EU , and both parties will profit from such an agreement . #% Over the last two or three years we have seen enough of the dreadful practices in parts of the animal-feed industry , sometimes practices that were already illegal according to the rules of those days . #% Since we are trading and cooperating in a variety of ways with Third World countries and our fleets are operating in Third World country waters - will those countries be taken into the Commissioner 's confidence when she is drawing up the new common fisheries policy ? #% However , it hardly engaged the well-known dissatisfaction of this Parliament with both the quality and the manner of EU Justice and Home Affairs developments at all . #% I welcome the new strategic goal of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive area . #% From the very first trialogue of this year with the Portuguese Presidency , the one thing that was obvious to everyone is that we need an agreement between the three institutions on the funding for the western Balkans . #% Companies setting up or changing to this way of doing business have to look carefully at the way they operate , at the information and the service they provide to customers if they are to survive . #% Nonsensical ageism removes experience and expertise often where and when it is most needed . #% My colleagues in the other British political parties still cling to the idea that they will be able to persuade the European Union to change its ways . #% That is no mean feat . #% This was an extremely full and helpful reply . #% We are suggesting that where the recital reads ` the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan , Afghanistan , India and Kashmir ' , it should now read : ` in the region of Kashmir , the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan , Afghanistan and India ' . #% Commercial farmers have also been concerned that they too could lose out and be forced always to buy a limited number of expensive seed strains from big seed breeding companies . #% Much has been said about the importance of the EU having a common front and a common voice and I agree with that . #% Mr R√ºbig talked about small and medium-sized enterprises , the very things that are needed within the European Union and within the developing countries to help them . #% As Mr Crowley said so eloquently this evening , this is all about people . #% The new Financial Regulation is also complicating matters , especially the A-30 lines . #% I would not like to see the situation where the new statute introduced a factor of discrimination where consumers were concerned that if you were not big enough to consider it worth being a European private company , you are not big enough to do business in Europe . #% That is why I am sorry to see amendments tabled which reflect the Industry Committee 's position . #% I welcome many of the features . #% What he is talking about is an instruction from the Labour Party that no Member of this House may discuss with the press the electoral mechanisms in the United Kingdom . #% He also talked about working with others to deal with international terrorism . #% China takes Europe quite seriously , but not perhaps as seriously as it should . #% We are in the most literal sense blood brothers and blood sisters . #% But we are largely looking at private hate and prejudice . #% We would support the first part and oppose the second . #% We have had , as colleagues have mentioned , our own experience of platform disasters in the North Sea . #% But many Member States do not class breast cancer as a disability , which is why we need a definition of disability . #% It will also work with international agencies , particularly the WHO , which is so fundamental in these areas . #% Mr Blair and his government may think themselves very clever in avoiding a proper debate on the EU at the last general election . #% 
Citizens have a Treaty right to petition Parliament about whether rules are being respected . #% Europe can act by strengthening child protection legislation and ensuring adequate child protection , particularly in some of the applicant countries , such as Romania and Hungary . #% There are strong arguments for having a look at this again and this is something I will talk to the rapporteur about . #% Which is it ? #% But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high ? #% It must either release prisoners if there is no evidence against them , or try them under international law . #% We must tackle the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography across the EU . #% The more the word ` racist ' is bandied about , the more it will become meaningless , devalued and ignored by the public at large . #% It must not be built and EU governments , such as the UK government , must not grant export credit . #% In supporting the Urban initiative , let us not hear about duplication . #% We want to oblige them to do that . #% MEPs have a responsibility to ensure the vital interests of the Union are protected by improving its internal security , whilst at the same time balancing the citizens ' rights of access . #% I would agree with Philip Bushill-Matthews as well . #% Parliament has made a number of changes and , of the 19 amendments we agreed on , the Council has accepted ten of the minor ones in full and another four in part . #% More has to be done , as Mr Santer himself accepted , in this whole field of research . #% This is a test for the leadership skills of Ehud Olmert as he takes the helm after Ariel Sharon 's stroke earlier this month . #% There is not yet a solid research base within Africa for Africa . #% Mr President , I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so . #% We get a suggestion that the Commission can go and sit down with the Americans and talk to them about the aid they are giving to try and level the playing field . #% Turkey 's EU accession negotiations are now under way . #% Who knows what will happen in our new Parliament , assuming of course that we are both re-elected ? #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , there are approximately 400 000 people with multiple sclerosis within the EU . #% For example , we agreed on VAT for intra-Community supplies but disagreed on joint and several liability in the framework of cross-border transactions , and in quite a few instances , we have both been disappointed by the slowness or lack of backing by Member States . #% I can not help thinking this is more a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted ! #% These elections are a step in the right direction . #% If European taxpayers had not paid , we would still be under the stranglehold of the demonisation that followed the Second World War and Soviet domination . #% Two hundred years ago our ancestors charged around the world , colonising and abusing distant countries . #% Our rapporteur proposes the original date 1992 plus seven years . #% So , first of all , our strategy has to be to keep the international community together to ensure that we all speak with one voice . #% The loyalty of this House , as Elmar Brok has said , is to get enlargement in place . #% These conduct-of-business and advertising rules have been used to protect markets rather than consumers and the Commission should clamp down strongly on that . #% In particular we can not expect the new accession states to achieve easily or quickly the high levels of recycling of these products that already exist in some more advanced Member States . #% I would , therefore , make an urgent request that the opportunity should be given to Members to find , at least , non-smoking recreational areas in these premises . #% The way that the committee has finally structured its approach strikes exactly the right balance . #% We say to those who are resistant to this : please remember that it is necessary to bring everybody on board . #% It is in the long-term self-interest of the economically developed and democratic world to use its economic strength to promote economic growth and democracy in the developing world . #% Thirdly , we will not single out the Commission for specific criticism over underspending or for its failure to address the horizontal objectives sufficiently . #% By kidnapping two French journalists , Islamic terrorists have not respected French neutrality , instead blaming France for defending its understandable and much cherished secularism by its banning of the veil in its schools . #% I am delighted that Prime Minister Brown has finally decided to show up , although , unfortunately , to show up late . #% Why are we focusing so much on LDC imports here ? #% Stocks of elvers wax and wane even if there is a downward overall decline . #% Mr President , I would like to inform the House , under Rule 111 , that last Thursday , the offices of the Moss Media Group in Moscow comprising independent television and a number of newspapers and magazines were raided by so-called tax police , uniformed and armed . #% We need to remember that nation states have their own problems . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , first let me also extend my congratulations to you on your appointment and the conduct of your first debate . #% No new amendments have been tabled here in plenary . #% This is an extremely important proposal as it will reduce the unnecessary burden of red tape on small businesses and help over five million firms to make a saving of approximately GBP 1 000 each . #% The proposed law has been condemned by NGOs , including the International Lesbian and Gay Association , the Council of Europe and Amnesty International , as well as others . #% Therefore , the Liberal motion before us today will not be supported by me , as its primary purpose is to bash the United States of American in its global war on terrorism . #% However , that is the small print . #% This time we hope it will involve Parliament . #% We are adopting legislation that appears to fill this need . #% The Commission wants the power to be proactive , to study and act upon significant outbreaks wherever they occur and , given the draft Treaty commitments on coherent public health policies across Europe , to take proper coherent action where and when it is needed . #% It would simply be a futile effort by the Americans to preserve unviable jobs in steel . #% Let us welcome it . #% We must recognise that the industry was not of one view on this matter , with the incumbent network or transmission system operators resisting change , while most of the other operators , be they upstream or downstream , strongly endorsed the underlying principle embodied in the Commission proposal . #% All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation , and it is these laws which should be utilised fully rather than to create yet more EU legislation , which would have resulted in negative consequences . #% I urge you to vote for Amendment No 21 and for the last six words of Amendment No 42 . #% In the last 30 years , the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times : firstly , total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading ; secondly , annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350 , that is , 1 % of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99 % are for speculation . #% We can but hope . #% The majority of Member States already have , in theory , measures in place to deal with the situation of irregular migration , and you would think that would signal an apparent commitment to action . #% The proposed European stabilisation mechanism itself raised new questions on the financial markets and the existing Financial Stability Mechanism is now regarded as insufficient . #% Our rebate will never be given up until the CAP is radically reformed , with the funds freed up , used to address modern priorities like research and development , combating climate change and external action funding to stabilise the Western Balkans , help Eastern European countries like Ukraine and fledgling democracies in the Middle East such as Iraq . #% Could I take the opportunity to thank colleagues for their solidarity and support . #% Can I ask two brief questions ? #% In any event , is what we voted on today legally admissible ? #% The key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties . #% 
Who knows , however , what real public opinion is in the Arab countries ? #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I too would like to thank Mr Kirkhope for his unfailing cooperation and support for all members on the committee . #% The US Administration is not going to change its position before the election . #% Will you start to make speeches explaining the European Union in the country you and I know best ? #% This is an excellent paper and I commend it to you , Mr Barroso . #% Madam Commissioner , you said our credibility is at stake . #% Mr President , it is important to establish the EU 's relations with its new neighbours , following the enlargement through a zone of prosperity and a ring of friends with whom the EU enjoys close , peaceful and cooperative economic relations . #% Mr President , I must begin by apologising for being delayed , thank to the vicissitudes of the European travel system . #% Mr President , we very much welcome the opening of the British Presidency of the European Union . #% Yes , we need to establish linkage , but in taking this package now and taking a holistic approach to the need to improve information and consultation for workers . #% Mr President , I want to make a point on the European Council in Ghent . #% I am very pleased that paragraph 7 of Mr Mantovani 's report , quoting the World Health Organisation , talks about health being best served in a more socially cohesive , egalitarian society with a smaller burden of relative deprivation . #% That is the way to do it , and it is one I very much admire . #% I agree with Mr Dehaene that we should give the presidencies as much as encouragement as possible to find one . #% Amendment 61 , on the Everything But Arms Agreement , should be opposed . #% Obvious examples are the reform of the CAP and structural funds and reform of the EU 's decision-making structures . #% Mr President , two weeks ago Mr Tannock asked you to rule on the status of the STOA report on inedibles in foodstuffs after the STOA Panel voted not to publish it . #% I am told that an answer is awaiting the Minister 's signature . #% It is for that reason that , since 1995 , annual targets are set for the appointment of women to these and to other management posts . #% paragraph 17 - we believe that the presence of United States conventional and nuclear forces in Europe remain vital to the security of the continent and consequently it would be wrong to call on `` the USA to clarify the situation of the quantity and strategic objectives of its tactical nuclear arsenals stationed on European bases '' ; #% Can he reject the false stories which have been put around by some in the UK that these methods were originally vetoed by the Commission , if that was not the case ? #% We would like to postpone the vote on this calendar to the next plenary session , so that those of us who have tabled this motion can debate our working methods , that is to say , how we can improve regulation in the European Parliament and how we can better use the EUR 300 million it costs us to be here for the pursuit of better regulation . #% Ten years and no agreement must be a failure by any measurement you wish to adopt . #% There can be a lot of flexibility . #% Essentially , this report represents a balanced , far-reaching , sensible and tough approach to a perennial problem which besets all Member States of the EU . #% I start by thanking the rapporteur for her remarks and for her work in committee . #% I think it is very important that we have some mechanism in the House to adjust the agenda when an urgent situation such as this arises . #% Why keep it secret ? #% Not only was the very complex negotiating process begun on time but the European conference was launched in such a way as to ensure that it immediately got down to discussing matters of direct relevance to the European citizens , particularly drugs and crime . #% There are few controls even inside . #% New research in the UK , part-funded by the UK Government , reveals that children find it increasingly hard to breathe the closer they live to main roads . #% I trust that the European Council and the Commission will be generous to Turkey in this respect . #% I would point out to the Commissioner that we are not talking about the general introduction of new mercury into the environment - the vast majority of these makers actually use recycled mercury taken out of the environment in the production of these new instruments . #% We understand our role and responsibility here . #% The second , was the rail crash in London which involved a train taking hundreds of people from the capital to the region of England I represent , in which 70 died and 200 were injured . #% In the case of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications , as the text of our question quite clearly sets out , we already know that a significant number of problems in relation to recognition of professional qualifications are encountered by citizens across the European Union . #% I confess I particularly like paragraph 10 , which calls on the industry to do more about commercial exploitation of space . #% To that end we are all pleased that the Council has adopted some of the amendments we tabled at first reading , notably , and probably most importantly , those specifying in the legislation itself that the Commission must develop a detailed methodology by which dumped , unfair prices are calculated so that there is a coherent and credible methodology to distinguish dumped prices from normal pricing . #% It does one more thing : it shows that the choices we face at European level are really choices of policy , not choices between national viewpoints and national visions . #% I know that from having been Minister responsible for drug addiction in my own country . #% I agree with Mrs Ek that nowadays people might not have a job for life any more , but I think people still have a right to expect that they can have a life with a job . #% This is a wake-up call to the Commission and in particular Commissioner Byrne , whom I now call upon to come before the House to make a statement on this issue . #% We should sort this out now and address the other outstanding issues more seriously and more successfully once the Treaty of Nice comes into force . #% And yet we now have a situation in which , as they say , 13 Member States are facing infringement procedures by the Commission . #% Kyrgyzstan also serves as a transit point to south-west Asian narcotic markets and narcotics bound for Russia and the rest of Europe . #% To go further has no basis in science , except for a tiny sample of 43 children in Denmark , which was itself rejected by the Danish Food and Veterinary Administration . #% Not sexy , but significant . #% In fact , a number of NGOs with Taiwanese membership are members of GOARN and , therefore , they have no shortage of information . #% But we can , I believe , and we must do more . #% Secondly , it is clear that there is a lack of emergency planning . #% Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue . #% It is time for a deal with its most obvious partner . #% So I am now in the very happy position of saying to you : do as the United Kingdom , Ireland and Sweden have done . #% This Parliament would urge the Commission and the new Director-General of DG XXIV - when appointed - to show the same determination about legislation in this field of financial services that the rapporteur has shown . #% Another issue is the question of remunerated donation . #% To demonstrate the absurdity of this stance , you should note that a human being on average breathes in 20,000 white asbestos fibres a day ; up to 2 million exist in the lungs of healthy individuals , and they are all from natural sources . #% In the real world , this would be seen as a work of fiction , not a serious proposition . #% No major political party in my country , except my own , is prepared to campaign honestly and openly on European issues at election time . #% If the French Government insists that we meet here for 12 sessions a year - and I have not been one of those complaining about it - please let us get to the plenary session and indeed get home from the plenary session after the votes at 6.30 on Thursday evening ! #% Therefore we should not look at every summit meeting as though it is a test of strength between national governments . #% Is the Commission in a position to confirm that this afternoon , and if not , will it undertake to supply its views on this matter with urgency to the Industry Committee of the European Parliament ? #% Mr President , my group welcomes the fact that this debate is taking place this evening because this is the first time that we have been able to have an annual policy strategy debate this early in the process of the budget for 2003 . #% Mr President , as you suggested , this report is meant to focus on the real opportunity that the UN Special Conference on Children and Children 's Rights which takes place later this month gives this Parliament to focus on a fundamental way in which we can tackle global poverty . #% It is very important that we include CIA flights in this report . #% But how were we to ensure that those promises of a changed culture , so often honoured in the breach , were finally respected ? #% Obviously everybody is looking into the detail now and although we were very excited when we first got the agreement , I think a lot of people would agree that it is going to be quite difficult to find out whether it is going to benefit some of the smaller clubs - in particular , academy clubs - as much as we hoped . #% 
As we have seen in Copenhagen this week , climate change is accelerating at an alarming rate , which will further exacerbate water shortages . #% It seems unlikely , despite the Commissioner 's optimism , that the United States Congress will agree to waivers of Titles 3 and 4 without any change of political control , if one takes into account the statements of Jesse Helms . #% Yet improving infrastructure would cost more in my part of England than the whole of the budget allocated to this scheme . #% We owe these former colonies . #% They will argue that American dominance can be sustained for many decades to come , not by arms control agreements but by augmenting America ' s power and therefore its ability to lead . '' #% I am , however , heartened that the new American Ambassador to the EU , William Kennard , seems to appreciate MEPs ' importance , and this is now being conveyed back to Washington . #% So we have to be careful about the size of the nets . #% He is a man of deep cruelty , he runs a reign of terror and , as a recent √©migr√© who fled from Iraq said , he has made a modern concentration camp out of Iraq . #% In Poland only 1 % of people with MS are treated with disease-modifying drugs , compared to 50 % in Sweden . #% Whatever happened to the comments made here this very morning that this is an amending House ? #% Should all go well tomorrow , we look forward to working with her on these and other matters . #% Unless we can get an assurance right now that they are , then we need to change the wording to ` not ' . #% Madam President , I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party on the Evans and Wibe reports . #% Mr Bowis says this was all the result of some brainstorm in the Commission . #% We have had the problems - we have experienced the problems with fuel duty in Britain and elsewhere whenever politicians try really to apply taxes which benefit the environment in this way . #% We are going down that route in Britain with wind turbine technology . #% However , there is a need for an independent inspectorate to keep a close eye on certain sectors , such as the work in abattoirs and slaughterhouses across Europe , where there is a lot of time pressure and pressure to perform and where there is evidence to suggest a potential public health risk -- most notably in the red-meat sector . #% It is regrettable that agreements made since the reform of external assistance still mean that three times as much European aid is spent on transport as on health and education , combined , for the poorest people in greatest need . #% Could he also say how he envisages the situation developing when Ifor comes to an end ? #% And it might not be a bad idea if we were to secure the borders more effectively in the United Kingdom . #% As I made clear earlier , implementing those commitments will be an important element in developing EU-Tunisia relations . #% It is by that yardstick that European citizens will judge the new currency ' . #% Madam President , I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning . #% I will read to you what it means because it is sometimes easy to forget : Interoperable Delivery of pan-European eGovernment Services to Public Administrations , Businesses and Citizens . #% These countries are still waiting for any kind of confirmation of this conference and have been told by the Commission that it would take place before the signing of the agreement . #% This is a difficult and complex subject not made any easier by the position that the whole railway industry finds itself in . #% We should therefore continue to uphold the equal technical criteria for all paints and not give an unfair advantage to water-based paints . #% I would ask one question , however . #% In conclusion , I know that on the record in September UK Labour MEPs said that they voted unanimously against retaining the opt-out , but it is never too late to repent . #% Regarding transport and tourism , I and my group welcome the proposals reinforcing transport safety although we need more concrete proposals on road safety and in particular , the issue of blood-alcohol levels and speed limits . #% We must also remember that these countries are all poorer than we are and they have to go through major problems of economic restructuring . #% There is a proposal to have a double majority system : a majority of votes and a majority of the population or a majority of states and of population . #% Article 10 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks clearly states that the Governing Council shall act by a simple majority . #% There are a number of colleagues here who worked in the last Parliament ; I see many familiar faces . #% Unfortunately too many of the public believe this nonsense is a decision of Parliament and are not aware it is the product of the unholy deal done for the worst of all reasons at Edinburgh in 1992 under the presidency of John Major . #% However , I have come to realise that the amendments proposed by the rapporteur do not change the fundamental problem . #% I believe it could send out the wrong signals . #% Can I ask you , Mr President , when you give authorizations for committee meetings in Strasbourg to be extremely strict in defining what is urgent . #% Should the Prodi Commission fail , then I fear that the European Council will execute a coup d'√©tat and deprive the Commission of its right of initiative and its important role as the promoter of European Union . #% People are still being made bankrupt and their health and their lives are still often in turmoil . #% Yes , we want to have prudent spending and prudent borrowing . #% Japan , incidentally , ties its debt relief to responsibility to buy Japanese exports . #% So I throw myself upon the mercy of the House and wonder whether it would be possible to vote early , rather than to vote late , on the Atkins report ? #% The Parliament voted , with a massive majority , to pat Mr Barroso on the back and tell him what a splendid job he is doing . #% This is especially relevant at this time , when all eyes are on developing a strategy for European tourism policy on the back of the new EU competences in this field . #% No-one seems to care . #% Clearly , all Member States benefit from a happy and balanced regional development of the European Union , and that is something I would certainly strongly support . #% I support Simon Murphy 's amendment to extend the provision from Class 1 to Class 2 buses so that double-decker buses and tourist coaches also enable disability access . #% Speaking about past agreements in Rome this year , the Commissioner herself said : ' I share the position of those who say the first generation accords simply wiped out fish , as has happened in Senegal ' . #% Mr President , I wish to raise an issue of serious concern to everyone who believes in democracy . #% It is clear that there is still some space in our Europe for public opinion to make its weight felt . #% It is a step in the right direction towards providing health and safety not only for the hauliers , but for other road users as well . #% However , this legislation places the entire financial burden of introducing these new recycling and disposal facilities on the producer . #% We know about the dependence of certain communities in the European Union on fishing . #% Professor MacCormick said that there seems to be a very great deal of agreement about the need to go forward without amending this proposal . #% It might make you unpopular in the short-run but I think it would make you loved and admired in the long-run . #% French and German utilities are able to buy UK power companies , yet it is impossible to have reciprocal opportunities to buy into EDF or acquire whole companies . #% The four brief points : the first is air conditioning . #% He fears German claims over Sudeten properties and , having listened to German politicians on this subject , I think he is absolutely right to be fearful . #% While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards , we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call ` ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters : rust buckets badly crewed ' . #% Make no mistake about it , the setting of interest rates by the ECB governor and his or her board of five governors will profoundly affect the United Kingdom 's interest rates , inflation levels and the strength of the pound sterling . #% Drug dealers and others like dealing in cash rather than through bank accounts because it leaves no trace . #% Madam President , the committee proposes to place a Charter of Fundamental Rights at the centre of the Union system , with mandatory effect upon the European Union , its institutions and the agencies . #% It is the American Administration that is the problem . #% I congratulate the Danish presidency and the Commission on bringing to a successful conclusion ten sets of parallel and very diverse negotiations , bearing in mind that only a couple of weeks ago , it seemed as if we would not do it . #% This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lom√© arrangement . #% 
Mr President , I rise to speak in favour of your proposal on the block voting . #% By opening the door to a supranational foreign and security policy , by giving more power to European institutions and abolishing national vetoes in policy areas crucial to our states , the Treaty takes a dramatic step towards the superstate feared by many . #% It is also why I referred to the further work that is being undertaken to clarify beyond any doubt for both potential employers and for Commission officials and former officials what the limits of activity are . #% Do you know if he is coming ? #% On services , the resolution demands an ambitious agreement with no rejection of the new benchmarking formula , and no clear exclusion of basic services such as water . #% Finally , it is right to include in our resolution a message to the Iranians that our international solidarity must be matched by their commitment to international human rights and standards of democracy . #% We have had major reports from the Commission showing the benefits of the internal market and we also know that the principal engine for job creation in markets of the future is going to be jobs in the service economy . #% It is arguable that if we concentrated on more cooperation between Member States and organisations , instead of creating complex and over-reaching structures , we would achieve more practical results for our citizens and we would thereby encourage greater acceptance of the sort of Europe that they can really accept and benefit from . #% I believe a strong message from this Parliament could have strengthened the negotiating hand of the Council and Commission at ICAO . #% The road user should not be the target of a witch hunt . #% Have a look tomorrow and on Wednesday and Thursday at the absolutely farcical voting system here and realise that whatever Mr Barroso said last week about deregulation , less regulation and the sixty legislative acts they intend to withdraw , there have been some 2 000 legislative instruments passed in the short period since 1 July , when the British took over the Presidency of the Council . #% What athlete would knowingly cause damage to his heart or liver , his kidneys or reproductive organs ? #% They will no longer be able to run their own economies . #% But some people here do not even want to mention that . #% Of the five , three are Filipinos and it is highly likely , as in the past , that the Filipinos - in other words the non-European people who are accused of apostasy in Saudi Arabia - will in fact be beheaded by sword . #% We also know that this impact is being felt most acutely in our small market towns which already have fragile rural economies and that is why they already qualify for Objective 5 ( b ) . #% The sorry story of Barings ' collapse reveals all too palpably human frailty at work . #% Again , it is left to President Barroso to make the case . #% More recently it has been given competence for health promotion and illness prevention and health impact assessments . #% Unfortunately , it has not always been done in a coordinated way . #% It is therefore perfectly acceptable and sensible for the management role to be devolved to the Member States . #% This is quite important because it is said that Saddam Hussein does not want anyone to go into his palaces . #% The Labour Government in Britain is at the forefront , leading a campaign against drink-driving . #% That is an absolute indictment of those people who work there . #% In particular I should like to refer to the way in which we deal in future with the question of EMU . #% We have a timely communication before us , which points to the breadth and growth of the transatlantic relationship from the declaration in 1990 to the new transatlantic agenda in 1995 . #% It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall . #% Would they rather see the poorest people have no access to education ? #% I can not assume that if the situation were precisely as the honourable Member describes , and smaller producers were in a dangerously disadvantaged position by comparison with the big producers , there would have been such agreement in the Council and in this House . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , like charity , rights begin at home . #% Next month in Portsmouth , my constituency , I am attending the opening of the Special Olympics organized for young people from across Europe with severe learning difficulties . #% We could all perhaps agree that the right to health is one of the most important , but all the detailed statistics show that people who are homeless , who are unemployed , who are in poverty , live much shorter lives and have much poorer health , than those whose social rights are safeguarded . #% Who can be against that ? #% Some of us heard that , but others failed to hear it . #% They should not have been smuggled from Libya to Rome along with 275 other rare tortoises , because they are in the highest protection category under the CITES Convention . #% Please name the obstructive Member States that are holding up this framework decision agreement and make a big push during your Presidency to outlaw race hate crimes . #% What a fine mess you have got us into . #% With regard to the CFSP , if we want a Common Foreign and Security Policy in Europe and we want that genuine choice , then we have to maintain a European defence infrastructure . #% Eighty years ago there was a link between major wars , disasters and a pandemic . #% I do not really expect more from the Commissioner tonight than I have heard from him privately . #% Mr President , I did indeed listen to Mr Spencer 's speech from my office . #% As my colleague , Hannes Swoboda , recognised in his excellent speech , there is a financial and economic crisis in parts of Asia as well as Russia . #% In December also , the Council , while failing to agree on the European Constitution , did at least agree that the paper presented by the Commissioner and by the High Representative entitled ` Strengthening the EU 's relations with the Arab world ' would be adopted in March . #% First , that the pledge made by President Pastrana personally to this Parliament on the dismantling of paramilitary groups has not been , and is not being , honoured . #% I hope that it will underline and take forward the long-standing basic Treaty freedom to provide services , and that at last we will make this existing freedom more of a reality than it has been to date . #% What has he achieved with his dog-like devotion to George Bush ? #% I am glad to say that for the first time in recent years we now have a report which can not only be read sensibly by people outside the European institutions but which also reflects their concerns . #% You will also have Members who wish neither to vote in favour of a text nor against a text by not pressing such a button and indicating to you orally which , as we have seen today , causes a number of problems . #% I hope that the Commission and the Council will note in particular the serious reservations expressed in this report about the trade proposal as it currently stands . #% It seems to me that in all this discussion of European security , two elements - defence capabilities and institutional arrangements - have been confused and one seems hostage to the other . #% Some UK Members on this side of the House may have reservations about one or two points but we fully believe in the principles of this resolution , the points that are practical and enforceable . #% If the EU legislates to try to restrict the sending of emails , whether for marketing , or fundraising , or political messages , the emails will still be sent to receivers within the EU - but from outside the EU . #% I have three points that I want to make . #% I shall refer just to things happening in my own country . #% But I commend the report and hope that the Commissioner will be able to take it forward to a legislative instrument . #% Surely our governments -- north and south -- and our European Union , can build on that . #% First of all I would like to express our broad support for this proposal and in particular welcome the flexibility contained therein , so far as Member States and their implementation is concerned . #% in writing . - The EPLP welcomes the positive elements in the Parliament 's first reading position , including funding for economic development in our regions , support for crucial research and development and increased overseas aid in line with the UK 's target to increase total overseas development assistance . #% I believe that even the most backward of students will be aware that the continent of Europe has been around for quite some time and is a bit more than an idea . #% I finish with a plea for a focus upon a programme that has begun but is far from finished , especially as regards the financial and trade regulations concerning Northern Cyprus . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Lechner on his report and on the way in which he introduced it to this House . #% Commissioner , we very much welcome the statement that you have already made on data breach , but I have to say I was somewhat surprised to receive a statement from 13 Member States that seemed to me to rather reinterpret the agreement that they had already signed off on 26 October . #% On sugar , bananas and cotton the WTO has done the ACP no favours . #% I regret , however , that the ECB does not follow the high standards of transparency and openness set by the Bank of England . #% Mr President , first of all , the Council seems to argue that it has no competence in the field of the individual rights . #% Most young people today across the European Union , whether they live in Germany , in Finland , in the United Kingdom , in the South of Europe are concerned about their future and they are concerned about their future job , or their future role in society . #% 
To those in the outside world -- the real world -- who are as appalled as I am by all this , I have a simple message . #% I am particularly pleased with the principle of individual producer responsibility , which has been so firmly embraced . #% Ninety-six years ago , Britain entered the First World War in order to protect the territorial integrity of Belgium . #% This is often because of pressures at home , in their personal lives . #% On the one hand , tragically , we have suicide bombers engaged in indiscriminate attacks upon Israeli civilians and , on the other hand , there is a tragic civilian loss of life on the Palestinian side , when Israel sends in its troops to root out those responsible . #% There is no question of suggesting that a new volume of money is required . #% Our growth level was less , our unemployment higher , our relative trading position was in decline and our share of global output falling . #% Of course in a drought the farmers can not grow alternative crops . #% For that reason I would like to ask the Council two specific questions . #% Sadly , the past six months have shown that this presidency has unfortunately been unable even to comprehend events , let alone establish its position in relation to them . #% I looked at the declaration today and for me it confirms that the Ecofin Council is the body responsible for economic coordination in the European Union . #% I can foresee certain equality of treatment issues coming before the European Court of Justice . #% In the light of the three steps you outlined to the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning , my Group is disappointed at the way in which the reforms have been implemented . #% I asked the Commissioner six supplementary questions and had the same success rate as I have with the national lottery . #% Surely , in a sane world , i.e. one without the EU , when someone buys a product , he becomes responsible for its safe disposal . #% Asking the US to consult before proceeding is not enough . #% The well established description of Scotch beef should continue to be used . #% Also , on administrative costs , how can it be sensible for the Commission to pay itself for the administration of its own resources ? #% Although I was not a member of the committee which produced this report , I want to speak because my colleague , Mrs McCarthy , who was a member , is detained by the grave events now under discussion at our party conference in Brighton . #% Who would put at risk his memory or his mind ? #% Our objective should not be poverty reduction but poverty eradication . #% To be consistent , the ELDR will vote for them . #% Madam President , my apologies . #% I did not vote . #% The overall aim is regionalisation via a uniform Community approach . #% Mr President , this is an important report and it must be approved and brought into law across Europe as quickly as possible . #% It is also timely for Europe to legislate now with the alarming rise in the Far Right and racist violence . #% The G8 should cancel now all IMF and World Bank debts for countries committed to those 2015 development targets . #% There is growing concern that , while food aid distribution continues across the worst affected parts of the country , financial support for emergency operations is tailing off . #% My colleague Mrs Mann will deal with the economic aspects , on which there are several excellent proposals . #% I just wonder whether or not , having listened to all the debates , you are actually totally and utterly aware of the devastating effect of this decision on UK farmers . #% It will enable staff to be recruited specifically for the requirements of reconstruction and for a period of time , as Mr Bourlanges sought , that is limited to the tasks in hand . #% On the one hand , there are the delays and dilution of measures resulting from the national veto . #% It is important that it is in competent hands and we now see that it will be . #% As you may appreciate , negotiations are going on today in London . #% Finally , I support the rapporteur 's proposals that the Council 's decisions should be amended so they can be reviewed before 1 Jan 2002 and that the Commission , EFC and ECB should report before 1 July 2001 on the state of interinstitutional relations in the context of EMU since the beginning of Stage 3 . #% It would be best to be blunt here . #% I would be grateful if you could write again , and also use your good offices in relation to the plane spotters . #% That is the question of career structure and your proposals to move to a linear career structure . #% We therefore welcome the statement by the incoming President , Mr Prodi , that there will now be codes of conduct applied rigorously , but we have heard this before . #% We would therefore like to propose that this oral question be attached to the overall debate on the legislative and work programme for 2004 , because over the weekend we heard that President Prodi will be raising the question of OLAF during that debate and we have a number of questions we would like to ask in that context , which are included in the substance of this oral question . #% The arrests of alleged coup plotters last December , threats against journalists who report them , and the arrest of 30 perceived activists preceding the Ogoni Day celebrations last month are all testimony to the abandonment of even token efforts by the Nigerian government towards democratic transition . #% Let me raise some issues that need highlighting . #% War is never without a price in terms of human suffering , but human freedom and global security for all of us here today has no price . #% But there seems to be no good reason on safety grounds why closure should not take place in 2008 , rather than 2006 , if this would make a significant difference to Bulgaria 's economic situation . #% Mr President , I just want to ask about the split vote from a procedural point of view . #% I would also like to thank him straight away for co-sponsoring my amendments to ask the Commission and the UK Government to look for an opt-out , especially on the transport of live horses to the continent for slaughter . #% I particularly welcome the right to vote and stand as a candidate at municipal elections in the European Parliament , although I would flag up the generous voting rights granted to Commonwealth citizens in the UK and urge there is no reorganization of this and no attempt to water down the rights which exist . #% I understand that his reply has been held for some time ` awaiting signature ' , presumably to ensure we should not see it before today 's debate . #% One way to eradicate this is to ensure that landmines and cluster bombs are not used . #% Their overwhelming conclusion was : `` The main gap seems to lie in the lack of an overarching integration strategy which would bring together and use the synergies of policies and legislations relevant to transport , environment and health . '' #% Are there some intrinsic problems with the directive ? #% With the inclusion of the fifth application - the Public Regulated Service or PRS - it is impossible to guarantee that this encrypted signal , which is reserved for the State , will not be used for military purposes . #% It is appropriate that the same institutional arrangements and procedures should apply . #% I should also like to congratulate Jody Williams and the international campaign to ban landmines , in particular on winning the Nobel Peace Prize . #% She has been a brilliant rapporteur and we have got a very positive result . #% Most of us are not scientific experts . #% Second , the real opportunity we had to extend this directive to cover recreational uses has been completely lost in the compromise . #% It is of course open to Member States to apply them nationally , but that is a matter for them and not for us . #% We are working towards equality between men and women and respect for human rights , both within Europe and beyond it . #% Although it is a non-legislative report , it would be a pity to vote down a report on such an important subject . #% If , at the end of the day , we can not get an agreement - and this is the important point - I have no doubt that this House will not delay the vote on 9 April . #% Therefore , Commissioner , I agree with what you said when you spoke about the prohibitions and the need for them to be examined and to come forward in the review . #% I know there is a view that a revision should not be launched because we might end up with a weaker , not a stronger , instrument . #% This decision was , I am glad to say , opposed by the Liberal Group and also by the GUE Group , but the Conservatives , Socialists and Green Group insisted on cancelling the delegation . #% In considering this proposal I start from a position of believing that we need to be aware that public subsidies , by possibly featherbedding and insulating an industry from genuine market forces , can actually do more harm than good . #% 
I want to pick up on the elections , which the Commissioner and Mr Lobo Antunes both spoke about . #% In any case , a legally binding ban would merely present another opportunity for certain states to exercise their hypocrisy , as we have seen , for example , with the efforts by some to evade the European Union 's targeted sanctions against regimes in Zimbabwe and Burma or , indeed , the efforts by certain states to circumvent UN sanctions against the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq . #% I have followed this proposal with interest and was a member of the original conciliation which failed . #% But , we believe that the EU should develop as a partnership of independent nation states , not as a single federal entity . #% The EU wants its own satellites to be a part of future military operations , and is not prepared to wait . #% We must not deny asylum seekers access to European Union territory . #% I fear we have missed an opportunity . #% We rightly call on Hamas to renounce violence or face consequences , yet stand by while the Israeli army shoots innocent children in Gaza and Ramallah with no consequence . #% Education is crucial to prevent people being infected with HIV in the first place , but access to drugs really does make a difference . #% I want to add two points which are not related to this Parliament but are related to my constituency . #% They feel it is Europe 's job to provide those bridges . #% Burma 's rulers have driven themselves and their people into a cul-de-sac . #% Anyone who has lived with relatives who suffer from debilitating and chronic conditions hopes for progress in treatment . #% At the last part-session , I raised under points of order , this whole question and asked the presidency to give this House a comprehensive report about the state of reform discussions as soon as possible . #% All candidate countries of course must meet the Copenhagen criteria and Turkey is surely no different . #% My question to the Commission is : first , what does he think the possibilities would be of a successful challenge to certain aspects of Helms-Burton in the United States Supreme Court , especially that part of the Act which punishes spouses and children by executive action , by withdrawal of visas , residents ' facilities and so on - the biblical principle that the sins of the parents will be visited on the children ? #% The cease-fire is still in effect . #% It is necessary if only to avoid contradictions , with the Commission saying one thing , the Council saying another , the Parliament saying something else . #% I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for putting forward the oral amendments that would allow the pressure from this petition to be used to help not just the hundreds of thousands of sufferers from multiple sclerosis , but also sufferers from other similar mobility-impairment and neuro-degenerative diseases , who need help too . #% Is it not ludicrous that countries that run up a deficit of over 3 % are then fined enormous sums of money , making their position worse ? #% We must also reschedule the next IGC . #% I am a European Muslim . #% We are seeing these key standards that have been fought over for very many years now being rolled back in the name of trying to be ever more competitive . #% They are absolutely hungry for information in order that they can be more effective in their parliaments . #% They can go to the independent tribunal and afterwards , to the other areas of recourse as well . #% I am slightly disappointed with the response from the Commissioner . #% Is the Assange case about the crimes allegedly committed in Sweden or is it about the desire of the United States of America to extradite him from a compliant European country ? #% In the last few weeks , many MPs and party officials have narrowly escaped death after violent attacks . #% I am convinced , however , that Tunisia is now genuinely committed to long-term reform and to promoting genuine human rights , good governance and secular democracy . #% The number of complaints received by the Commission and the number of petitions to Parliament clearly show that citizens need that opportunity . #% Unfortunately this report fails to make the vital link between congestion and air traffic reduction and therefore misses a vital opportunity to address these problems in a lasting manner . #% We should learn in the name of competitiveness to refrain from burdening and cluttering the European Union from excessive regulation or initiatives which are not strictly necessary . #% We also need consistency . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , my Group is committed to protecting human rights , but we are not convinced that allowing the EU to sign the convention is wise . #% Journalists and internationally respected human rights activists need to be given the strongest rights and protections of any democratic system . #% Of course I am concerned about homeless people but concern for the welfare of animals and concern for the welfare of people go together . #% But having said that , it is important to get each trade dispute in proportion . #% So , we encourage people either to enter into honest , durable relationships , or we encourage them to enter into marriages of convenience which would drive a coach and horses through this directive and all of its intentions . #% We merely wish to open up the debate as to what mechanisms might be possible to help us best solve this problem , so the idea of the question is to start the dialogue with the Commission in the hope that we can close this loophole and find a solution to what is a serious problem , particularly for those people who find themselves victims of an airline insolvency . #% After 11 years of abject failure to produce auditable financial accounts , how can we possibly justify putting in place an agreement allowing more of the same ? #% For that reason I am suggesting that the Commission 's proposal to put the whole 12.5 million into a negative reserve be rejected and I propose that the whole amount remain in reserve subject to a detailed application from the trademarks agency justifying transfer of all or part of that money for their use . #% I am sure that he will agree with me that a clear and simple statute for associations will enable voluntary organizations and charities to be recognized as full social partners in our deliberations , to engage in the debate about the European Union , to be consulted about draft legislation by the Commission and to promote participation at the grassroots level which is currently so sadly lacking . #% Independent legal opinion in England has said that the allegations against Mr Assange would not constitute rape under English law . #% As rapporteur on the European neighbourhood policy , I believe that it is nevertheless important to keep Syria engaged in dialogue with the EU and to encourage the process of democratisation and observation of fundamental human rights which Syria has signed up to in its international obligations - obligations which it must meet if it really wants to enjoy a beneficial EuroMed action plan in future . #% How can we expect our own immigration and police authorities to be able to crack down on the systematic abuse of our system ? #% The NPT Treaty is a bargain , with non-nuclear states agreeing not to acquire nuclear weapons and existing nuclear states agreeing in return to begin a process of disarmament . #% Rome II plays its part as forming the basis - the initial roadmap - but the following studies give us the chance to re-evaluate and make the next steps forward . #% I promptly received a written reply at the end of that Question Time . #% As the Socialist Group has withdrawn its approval of Amendment No 40 at it stands , I suggest we revert to the original wording of Paragraph 16 - `` significant increase '' - and vote on that text first . #% Compare that with the port of Tilbury , which achieved a 50 % reduction in accidents in 2005 , or Great Yarmouth , which has seen no reportable accidents for two years . #% Any mini-victory that we feel that we won at committee stage by changing the words ` Member States shall ' to ` Member States may ' start to collect this data is lost : I am afraid , with Defra back home , I feel they will take any opportunity to use EU rules to control us in any way that they can . #% Madam President , Tibet is an issue which is on our agenda year after year after year , and to that extent I understand the point that the honourable Member has made . #% The social security systems of Member States certainly recognise different sorts of stable relationships -- stable units . #% My final point concerns B3-4106 . #% But we believe that at this stage it is too late to criticize the Commission . #% The monthly and often weekly reports of trade union members ` disappearing ' and being killed tell the true story of the blood toll paid by those who dare to assume that ILO rights officially adopted in theory will actually be respected in practice . #% It sounds like a good idea , but in practice all these criteria depend on judgment , as Mr Almunia has just explained . #% We can look forward to a future which builds on its recent success . #% Mr President , in the interests of making the wording of paragraph 5 , indent 2 clearer and less clumsy , I would like to replace : ` undertake political reforms leading to democracy and the rule of law starting through a multiparty system and the right for all currents of opinions to express their views ' , the ending of which is rather clumsy , with the following : ` to draw up and implement as soon as possible all the necessary reforms required to democratise the country , guarantee the peaceful expression of political opposition and ensure a speedy holding of multiparty elections under international monitoring with a view to national reconciliation ' . #% So I just wonder whether the Council has lost its nerve . #% Coming from Britain , with our traditional links to India , I commend the Karim report and call on the Commission to develop a much deeper political and economic India-EU relationship culminating in a bilateral free trade agreement . #% Please will you start to make positive speeches and explain ... I am sorry to see you are not even listening ! #% Let us do what we can within the scope of our existing powers . #% We have tried to reach a compromise in our deliberations . #% In the last five years , the United Kingdom has proved to have the most dynamic Fair Trade structures of all the EU Member States and is the fastest growing Fair Trade market in the world . #% Whilst I am grateful to Mr Prodi for outlining the Commission ' s work programme this morning , I have to say that in the areas of regional policy , transport and tourism , the programme is more notable for what is missing than for what is in it , and I would hope that over the next year we could put those matters right . #% 
The third surprise is the fact that there is no one here from the Council , because this debate is on SABs . #% I would just point out that there is an item of some EUR 225 million for studies relating to it in the budget , whereas the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , of which I am a substitute Member , says that they do not want more studies but more action and implementation on the ground . #% There is still a need for them to not lower their guards against public corruption , and some high-level indictments and convictions will certainly be a powerful example to deter further corruption . #% That is the purpose of Amendment No 50 , in my name and that of Mrs Doyle and others . #% Although the Commissioner has told us , the United States , is not at present implementing the Helms-Burton law in certain respects , is he aware of the fact that many European businessmen have been intimidated into refusing to take the risk of incurring liability under Title 3 and Title 4 of the bill and , if they have had relations with the United States , have preferred to limit relations with Cuba or not have any at all . #% We can not send our troops into action unless we have the capability to support them . #% If we do not come out of this crisis on a progressive path to reform , we will be condemned to inexorable relative decline with the most profound consequences for the promotion of our values and , indeed , for the future of the planet . #% I would hope that the Committee on Budgetary Control will pursue that and encourage our colleagues in national parliaments to have a real dialogue with us on this . #% Congratulations to all concerned . #% The two current hotspots show that this outbreak will be with us for many months . #% Can the rapporteur tell us - because she did not say this in her speech - why we should doubt the FDA assessment ? #% In addition , British fishermen from the south-west of England to the north of Scotland are continuing to suffer greatly because of the common fisheries policy . #% Never again must we see the enormous funeral pyres all over the landscape of the north-east of England , which had such a devastating effect on the tourist industry and all related industries , not just agriculture . #% But , as colleagues have said , we ought to take an even-handed approach and we must remind the Palestinian authorities , in particular , that their police should not be using their arms to attack the Israeli security forces . #% in writing . - Whilst voting for this report , I consider it ironic that this fund exists when not all EU countries utilise it . #% Yet the practicalities of an agreement with a state the size of Congo create all sorts of daunting problems . #% But what this debate does reveal is that , while everyone says we should have sustainable fishing policies , in practice , when it comes down to it , some people do not understand the word ` sustainability ' . #% I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices , because that would be a very serious matter indeed . #% Mr President , as rapporteur I wish to move an oral amendment . #% On behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , I am pleased to be able to deliver this opinion , on behalf of my colleague , Mrs Hazan , who unfortunately can not be with us tonight . #% We live in times when there are increasing numbers of cross-border purchases and contracts . #% It will make absolutely no difference to them at all . #% In addition they have the pressure of dealing with high numbers of patients with HIV/Aids and other very difficult diseases . #% Without doubt , one of the consequences of mergers and takeovers is the effect on employment and I know that the Commissioner , within the confines of the Treaty , is sensitive to this . #% They are actually about providing the simple information that a business needs if it wants to go and deliver a service in another country - that essential research before they start . #% If not , imagine the sort of problems we face in relation to , for example , the proposed directive we are currently considering on protection of workers from risks related to exposure to asbestos at work . #% Some damage , given human nature and the fallen world we live in , is inevitable . #% I am sorry if I made a mistake about the content of the 17 April conference but nonetheless , on many occasions , EU ministers in the Council have called for combating people-smuggling , people-trafficking and criminal gangs . #% Workers will continue to be exposed for many years because of demolition , removal , refurbishment and maintenance still having to take place . #% I welcome the forthcoming strategies which Mr Piebalgs mentioned . #% His last point merely reinforces one of the main aims of this whole proposal : to reduce bottlenecks . #% The report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market refers to the need to shorten the time taken to deal with complaints . #% Tobacco , we are told , kills half a million people each year in the European Union but do we ban it ? #% Perhaps he will now answer the point . #% Take appointments : to appoint the President of the Commission , to appoint the Governor of the Central Bank , even to appoint a member of the Court of Auditors requires unanimity in the Council . #% We agree entirely with the reasons for postponement ; that is there is no Commission in place to receive that discharge . #% We want the Commission to maximise local employment opportunities arising from the agreement , looking at access for fishermen to the tuna fishing business . #% As a result , parasitic infection is rife and the third cause of infant deaths is diarrhoeal disease . #% I urge this House to adopt it in its entirety , with certain amendments , so that an unambiguous message is sent to the disturbers of peace in that part of the world that the international community will not tolerate extremism or terrorism any more and that we respect and uphold the rights and ethnicity of the Kashmiri people . #% Both sides have , I believe , committed gross violations of human rights . #% The other thing we should learn from this is that the Lom√© peace agreement was imposed from outside by outsiders and was totally unworkable . #% Clearly we can not separate out economic freedom from political freedom . #% If the proposals were pursued , we would have another building block in the construction of a European State . #% Nevertheless , in this area in particular , action will speak louder than words . #% That seems to me to offer some lessons for the Barcelona Summit next year : if we want to push forward the economic reform agenda in this sector and in others , we need to continue to rely on the tried and tested Community method and not resort to the intergovernmentalism that frankly was implicit in much of what the Council seemed to suggest in the negotiation positions it took on this package . #% We have to listen to them and work with them because , quite frankly , their record of protecting their environment is better than ours . #% We have flexed our muscles and in doing so we have strengthened Parliament , now the Commission must earn our trust . #% Mr President , if the Council does not agree with the Commission , does that mean the Commission will have to take the Council to the European Court in order to participate in the military committee ? #% Will you please put in place the procedure to nominate people to fill those chairs , and if you can not do it yourself , why do we not have nominations and an election to fill those four empty chairs ? #% I would be interested to know , given all the research and the work that has taken place in the committee of experts , how well prepared you now think that business in Europe , in the European Union , actually is . #% The citizens of Europe demand an answer from the Commission as to why these dual standards are applied . #% Having undertaken these negotiations over some broad principles of terminology and participation , it is reasonable to expect now a consistent approach to all aspects of health policy in the pipeline and to look for an effective approach across Commission directorates and portfolios when it comes to cooperation on research or economic , social and environmental policies , for example , which affect public health . #% The planning process is a key element of sustainable development as , because it covers land-use , it sets the physical framework for the way in which we live . #% What is the Commission doing to make sure that airline operators take their responsibilities seriously ? #% We want the Commission and the governments to come out of this looking good : we do not want to be accused of stupid , irresponsible measures . #% If there is not the international resolve to disarm Hizbollah -- and that is a pity -- then at least there should be a requirement to monitor and report on Hizbollah 's activities . #% The matter was referred to the meeting of the Chairs of the Political Groups , where initially the only vote in favour of the report was that of Mr Bar√≥n Crespo from the PSE Group . #% The discharge report by Mr McCartin contains a number of quite scathing points and highlights ongoing problems within the Commission . #% We want to know what steps you are going to take or have already taken -- it says so in Rule 166 -- and we need that answer now , not tomorrow . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office Mr Sasi for the comments he made earlier on during this debate . #% Presumably , Commissioner Pinheiro , you will want those studies to support the Commission 's view that FTAs would actually help ACP countries to be integrated into the global economy . #% It was only by the narrow margin of 206 votes to 200 that we were able to hold this debate at all . #% But over the last 12 months it has become abundantly clear that Section 295 ¬© of the Pakistan penal code , which provides for the death penalty , is being misused : often to settle family feuds ; often on very dubious legal bases with just four witnesses ; and it is often being used to persecute not just the Christians but the other minority groups in Pakistan . #% In this context , education , agricultural development , visa facilitation or , ideally , liberalisation , must be at the top of the agenda . #% Indeed , in the United Kingdom , it is politically even worse : there are over GBP 800 billion of unfunded public service pensions , with recruitment in the public sector out of control . #% This concept , for some sort of European gendarmerie , has far-reaching implications and no place in the Commission proposal under discussion . #% 
It was not a happy experience and I hope the Commission would agree that both the Commission and Parliament have a lot to learn from this experience . #% Finally , I should like the Commissioner to provide more information and clarity on what is meant by ` vulnerable ' , ` special development needs ' and ` small economies ' . #% But the demand for places still far outweigh the supply . #% There are advantages and disadvantages to the position in which Mrs Roth-Behrendt and those of us , like the last speaker , who were previously on the Temporary Committee investigating BSE , find ourselves . #% Nevertheless , it is an important contribution in technical assistance and investment in key infrastructure projects , which can complement the work of the EIB and the EBRD . #% On mass slaughter , my group has an amendment to delete pre-emptive culling . #% I also welcome the Council 's recent conclusions , which very clearly demand meaningful consultation with the European Parliament . #% Last autumn , during the British Presidency and in the run-up to the extraordinary summit at Hampton Court , members of my own government were saying two contradictory things about the idea of the European social model . #% But I am sure that he will understand , as someone who observes the courtesies and recognises the basis on which a personal letter is written , that it is not for me to release a letter which I wrote to Mrs Gradin . #% I warned that we should not celebrate prematurely the end of this process because there was still a long way to go and of course I was right . #% It is my experience that the children themselves - the young people - have a wealth of understanding and experience - which we must tap into - on how to tackle poverty and environmental degradation . #% If these proposals become EU policy we will see the clock being turned back rather than being speeded up to keep pace with important technological developments . #% Mr President , it clarifies points 1 and 3 but I am not sure about point 2 . #% Secondly , the communication contains ideas on how to make the process more effective . #% Jean Monnet was the inspiration behind this and he wanted a system whereby , under the , the Community picked up power along the way . #% I very much hope that the Commissioner may be able to give some support to the relevant authorities in the United Kingdom . #% How can we expect people outside to take us seriously if we can not organise ourselves properly in here ? #% We must also be aware that not all elderly people fall into the same category . #% Europe 's future lies with high technology , where we can compete with the rest of the world by being the best in the world . #% Would the President please contact the officials and ask them to do something about it ? #% Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer , but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad . #% Commissioner Pinheiro says that we must have very clear development objectives in our international economic relations . #% Will we in fact find ourselves on the memorial last flight from Strasbourg to London on Thursday ? #% We need to come together with a clear offer of massive international assistance . #% Mr President , in relation to the Commission 's work programme on enlargement we have , as we would expect , a very thorough and indeed a very formidable programme to achieve in the next 12 months , in which the Commission has to address a large number of areas including , in particular , monitoring the progress of the candidate countries . #% I would like the President to write to me , so that I can explain to the Delegation for relations with the United States why we were refused a meeting with Jacques Santer but you later this morning will be having a meeting with the President of the Commission . #% Firstly , I should confirm here that I have heard nothing to suggest that any less priority would be given to people with disabilities and to what can be done for them by either the Italian presidency or the incoming Irish presidency . #% Therefore we are unable to accept the additional amendments tabled by some colleagues to the report in the part-session . #% Therefore I fully support and welcome the UN Security Council resolution for the establishment of an international peacemaking force involving willing and principally neighbouring countries such as Australia and New Zealand . #% I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure . #% I know that the speedy drafting and consideration of the report owes a great deal to the enthusiasm and hard work of Mr Miller , and indeed of his shadow rapporteur , Mr Harbour . #% We welcome your statement today but please move forward on these other agenda items , in particular the issue of unemployment . #% Some versions suggest we should also vote on the word `` fair '' , but that should be in the main part of the text . #% Mr President , the prosecution of the people 's democratic party stems from disturbances at their party congress as long ago as 1996 . #% In addition , all the candidates gave their commitment to a variety of forms of democratic accountability , which is to be welcomed with open arms . #% Likewise , the chairman of the board of regulators can attend the relevant committee and give an account of their work . #% Since Mrs Aelvoet has taken a bit of a pounding today I shall pay tribute to her part in it also . #% It is even more important to success to finish , as the British Government is doing , in style and with panache and with still something to spare in the tank . #% Well in simple economic terms , Europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity . #% Parliament had the courage to say that the Treaties must be reopened and our basic constitutional texts must be re-examined . #% How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country . #% This brings me to the report by Mr Kellett-Bowman . #% What would Stanley Gibbons have said from the Strand in London if he had still been alive ? #% It seems to me that the requirements for good legislation are that we can measure what needs to be measured ( which is not often the case ) , that the law should be applied equally throughout the Union ( which it is not in the common fisheries policy ) , that there is the same chance of contraventions being identified wherever they occur and that the penalties for contravention are roughly the same throughout the Union . #% In fact this Commissioner pledged to this House in January last year , a year ago , that we would have a directive on safer car fronts . #% I disagree with his conclusions that we need the Commission to examine anew the causes of low economic growth and to submit suggestions to reverse it . #% I wish to ask your advice on raising this particular issue with the Petitions Committee : I wonder whether that would be in order . #% In particular , we ought to draw everyone 's attention to the fact that , for example , the improved wording of the definition of occasional services will greatly simplify the application of the regulation and contribute to the development of a more efficient sector . #% It is in this spirit that Amendment 5 seeks to keep the negotiations open . #% I am delighted that Commissioner Nielson has on a number of occasions expressed his support for the Joint Assembly and for financial resources to be made available for us to be more effective in our work and for the participation of ACP Parliaments to be greater , because , after all , it is their legitimacy and accountability as parliamentarians that is at the heart of our work . #% I recognize the impossibility of harmonizing legal systems but as the President-in-Office has said we have just agreed a convention on divorce . #% So our next message must be that it is vital for the European Union to step up its preaccession strategy , to increase the speed of preparing these countries for membership . #% Despite these rejections , the drive towards harmonisation goes relentlessly onwards , even when it has nothing to do with trade or EU efficiency and is bad for citizens . #% Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today , well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago . #% Madam President , I should like to warmly welcome the Chancellor of the Exchequer 's words . #% In Amendment No 14 I propose that night work be limited to 8 hours with a possible temporary extension to 10 hours , so long as the 8-hour average is achieved over a reference period to be agreed after consultation with the social partners . #% I want them quickly to implement short-term action plans if ozone levels exceed double the WHO recommendations , and I want them to provide the Commission with information of a standard which enables comparison to be made between the performance of different Member States , so that the public can determine which countries are making a real effort and which are not . #% In the past , such actions have resulted in military action . #% Is he aware that since 1996 we have had a rights approach to disability that would suggest that we should support such a Convention ? #% We are tired of being a Greek chorus in this tragedy . #% I talked a lot with some of the organisations working in this field and they said that disabled children are twice as likely to be abused as any other children . #% In February , Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued . #% I am sure it is the same in other EU Member States . #% I therefore regard this as a legal red herring and I would prefer to concentrate on the merits of Mrs Sanders-ten Holte 's proposals because they will give the consumer travelling by air rights which have been lost for a long time . #% This is totally contrary to the purportedly democratic principles of this institution . #% It is for Member States to decide on what extra measures they deem necessary . #% 
Change in the law is fundamental . #% Continental taxes should not be spent on trying to sort this out when a British court is already hard at work trying to solve the problem . #% Yet I say to the Secretary of State that the Council 's position represents two steps back rather than one step forward . #% I trust that the Convention will follow the wise approach in rejecting the rigid and misleading concept of exclusive competences and in focusing instead on developing a more sophisticated system of power sharing . #% No-one is going to ask us to go and die on an Afghan hillside , though others will be asked to pay that price . #% European Parliament rules have been drawn up , and we are not abiding by them . #% We could say that , because we are only consultees , we can say what we like . #% We shall vote ` no ' . #% They have been a grave disappointment . #% If you put ` data retention ' -- a subject much in the news -- in the subject-matter search box , you get no documents at all . #% No , the amendments ignore them . #% We are still learning from the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the United Kingdom . #% I would say to Commissioner de Silguy that we achieved our balanced budget legislation with far less hype and excitement than the United States of America . #% Thus , although we regard the creation of RACs as a tiny step in the right direction , we remain resolute in our view that UK withdrawal from the CFP , returning management to local and national control , remains the only real way to safeguard the future of the UK fisheries sector and fish stocks . #% With those reservations and I know I speak on behalf of several colleagues - I will be following Mrs Terr√≥n ' s line . #% To change ` European public prosecutor ' , which I regarded as bad , to ` European judicial authority ' , which I regard as even worse , and to do it by way of a corrigendum is an abuse of the House , and I look for your ruling on it . #% The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet . #% We need at least the 30-day breathing period that the European Convention calls for , so that these women can decide whether they will take part in the prosecution of the traffickers . #% Two , the Code of Administrative Behaviour should be observed by all the EU 's institutions and bodies , not excluding the Commission itself . #% It builds very heavily on previous legislation , and the implementation of this legislation has been a disgrace . #% Firstly , is there any indication yet as to whether the Americans will retain forces in Bosnia and , if so , will they actually be in Bosnia or over the horizon in Hungary ? #% The EU suffered personal tragedies in all cases , as our holiday-makers in Sri Lanka and Thailand were washed away and our friends and families in Pakistan and Kashmir were lost in the rubble . #% Mr President , the fact that the left has just been voted out of office in Poland lends added poignancy to this debate . #% It is now time for us to look forward to the implementation by the Tunisian authorities of the commitments made by President Ben Ali on democracy , good governance and human rights set out in the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan . #% I know we are going to miss her very much and would like to extend our thanks to her . #% Mr President , I understand that the Commission is to require the British Merchant Navy to fly the European flag instead of the Red Ensign , which is known affectionately throughout Britain as the ` Red Duster ' and is a symbol of Britain 's identity . #% Tonight I should like to point out specifically the important task of Parliamentary ushers . #% Mr President , as a dedicated opponent of the whole EU process , I have to admit that on the face of it you are having a good week . #% The Member State initiative on interpretation and translation , proposing the text which the Council agreed on last October , is less ambitious than the Commission text and needs improving . #% This is a government whose defence budget has risen by 11 % in a year and which , one day , will have to answer allegations of involvement in the assassination of leading Tamil figures and other human rights abuses . #% I am concerned by Commissioner Frattini 's recent proposal to promote the recruitment of highly educated immigrants , including the creation of a ` green card ' for researchers , engineers and doctors . #% I believe the Committee on Budgets made a reference to the budget increasing from EUR 50 million to EUR 55 million , but on the basis that this should be proportionate to the implementation . #% I object strongly to the backing-winners approach of ` your money back ' if you have transported a winner in the asylum-seeking stakes . #% We believe that if this framework of legislation can be updated in this way , coupled with the new observatory on industrial change , it can give us the tools for a more pro-active approach to industrial change within the European Union . #% I congratulate Mrs McKenna on the extent to which her report has amplified and clarified the text . #% In Syria , we should be more supportive of democratic opposition to President al-Assad , who is clearly no friend of the West , as we have seen from his efforts with North Korea to develop a nuclear weapon and his political support for Iran and for terrorism . #% There should be much better dialogue between Parliament and the Commission to identify very clearly what action has been taken on European Parliament priorities . #% We know that there are businesses in Germany and potentially in Japan and America which would be interested in giving a future to employees by reconsolidating the sector . #% I have some reservations about aspects of the European project , but I am absolutely certain that those countries that wish to join should be allowed to join . #% In the modern world sovereign states use free trade agreements . #% I emphasise `` knowledge-driven '' because what we are talking about is the ability to achieve the widespread dissemination and availability of that knowledge . #% Defend our European public postal services . #% I have not met Mr Samecki before , so I am interested that he is here to provide an answer to an issue that Mr McCreevy and his team have been working on . #% The legal basis will be altered , but since the European Court of Justice did not comment on the substance , in real terms nothing has changed except , of course , the fact that the European Court of Justice will not have competence over the new agreement . #% Madam President , I can report that , at this moment , joyful Baghdad citizens are toppling a massive statue of Saddam Hussein in the centre of Baghdad , along with unarmed American troops . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Thors for this report and all her work on it . #% I do not think we want a market in human eggs and other human tissues . #% It is important to know that the Commission decided then to take all these matters in-house . #% I speak for those many people of East Anglia who want to see action , security , prosperity and a real change of direction in the EU , rather than empty promises . #% Madam President , in January this year I was part of the European Parliament 's delegation which undertook a fact-finding visit to Malaysia . #% My criticism of the British Government is that it has left it far too late to fight the battle for public opinion and that its effort to build a coalition of political support among the Europeans has clearly been poor . #% We see the military gap widening and perhaps difficulties also in expanding NATO operations . #% In many cases , repairs to these churches are phenomenally expensive for parishioners . #% The great improvement -- the theme of this directive -- is the clear emphasis on a risksensitive approach , so that there is a ` knowthecustomer ' obligation , including identifying the true owners of companies -- the beneficial owners -- which is higher if there is a higher risk of tainted funds . #% Hundreds of dockworkers are concerned today about this directive , one I believe was never required in the first place , mistaking , as it does , competition within ports for the real aim , which should be competition between ports . #% in writing . - The EU 2020 strategy demonstrates that social policy is a fundamental priority for Europe . #% This has created certain problems in the discussions with the Council . #% Mr President , can I just establish for yesterday 's Minutes a correction to my vote . #% The environmental concerns that Mrs Thors expressed need to be addressed , particularly the effects of putting this dilute sulphuric acid into the sea in certain port areas and also how we dispose of the sludge on store in an environmentally sensitive way . #% It is important to know that the conference is prepared to deal with issues which are important to the ordinary voters of the European Union , such as drugs and the battle against crime . #% It is also right that we look at seasonal bathing and do not try to cover the whole year . #% We have to be very careful about legislating on the hoof . #% Of course the circulation of the euro will have both positive and negative impacts . #% As far as I am concerned , this Irish referendum begins the real debate . #% On this , the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , we must stand up for those children , for their rights to be children . #% Nevertheless one has to take at face value the statement that the Council wishes to examine closely the report which the Commission is to submit before 30 June 2001 on progress in reducing outstanding commitments to bring them down to a normal level . #% 
Finally , why does the Commission resist the proposal from the ACP heads of government in Fiji to enter an initial phase of negotiations on principles with the ACP Group as a whole ? #% What Europe too often lacks is not extra mechanisms to implement agreed policies , but rather the political will to fulfil commitments which have already been made but not executed . #% If the response were to apply worldwide , no conceivable EU budget would be enough to support it . #% However , whilst I understand the argumentation over the legal base , we would be further complicating an already delicate situation if we were to seek to act in a peremptory fashion or advise others - including the United Nations - that they should do that . #% I believe the federal government understands that and indeed the minister of justice has also condemned the verdict . #% I believe that the European Parliament has delivered what my own parliament in Westminster would not . #% Without healthy people you do not have a healthy economy . #% I went to China personally on behalf of this House and saw that there are people ready to enter into dialogue with us on issues of labour rights and corporate social responsibility . #% They are for the benefit of the people of Eritrea and Eritrea needs those human rights now . #% It is the latest in a whole succession of human rights abuses in Pakistan : growing religious intolerance - which we have just been hearing elsewhere in the world - the lack of a fair trial , so-called honour killings of women , child imprisonment and so on . #% The human rights clause has also prevented the conclusion of agreements with Australia and New Zealand and with Belarus , following the increasingly authoritarian rule of Mr Lukashenko . #% Nonetheless I would like to hear from the Commission as to what we can do about Amendment No 7 . #% The job of the Petitions Committee is to help citizens highlight the problems with implementation and monitoring of EU law . #% You will receive a complaint in writing . #% But it is important that we build public confidence and trust in this technology . #% I think it is most unfortunate therefore that I am getting this negative response from the Commission because I do think that , as previous speakers have said , the image of the single market is very important , as is the way in which we work cooperatively with other Member States . #% Water . #% That is a political criticism we have to face . #% When I worked for Lord Cockfield I remember that progress-chasing in regard to the implementation of the 1992 programme was something that he laid much emphasis on . #% Parliament has secured significant concessions on transparency , on consultation and on oversight . #% If that is the case , the absolute minimum the authorities can do is to enable the international community to reassure itself of her wellbeing . #% The Commission in its report also refers to the vagueness of the requirement for an information and consultation meeting to be held with the workers as soon as possible in the event of exceptional circumstances which affect employees . #% I asked to speak at this ridiculous hour of the night in order to make three simple points . #% We are talking here about improving administration , and not in any way about tax harmonisation . #% To obtain access to certain basic social rights under the Staff Regulations , non-married heterosexual partners must , as indicated , have documentary proof that their partnership is recognised in a Member State , they must not be married or in a non-marital partnership with another person and they must have no blood relationship with their partner . #% This report is well worked out in its detail . #% The herring is an especially nutritious fish for human beings but sadly one which is no longer to be found in great abundance on the slabs of our fishmongers . #% This is of deep concern . #% No writing paper for the schools was allowed through , no clothing , no furniture , no electrical equipment , and no materials for reconstruction . #% I hope that will be received in due course , but the deadline was not respected . #% In the light of the recent breakdown of the negotiations with South Africa , are you prepared to say that Minister Billie Miller is wrong ? #% The European Progress Microfinance Facility will make available up to EUR 25,000 to people who want loans to start or grow very small firms , and who have been unable to obtain credit through conventional markets . #% I would like to comment on two amendments and would like to hear the Commission 's view on them . #% There will be reverses that will place this commitment under severe strain . #% Nor does it want things like nine separate missions around the world as part of an EU defence policy . #% It is all too often bemoaned that the EU has failed to foster a culture of innovation and enterprise : the European Investment Fund ( EIF ) is a vital way in which this imbalance can and should be redressed . #% I voted to abstain and against the amendments proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . #% Madam President , I also regret that a British comedy programme sought to make light of Parliament and would point out that my own group has , of course , already published its register of interests on the Internet . #% I must concur with the last speaker , I am concerned about the voluntary nature proposed by the Commission for the end-product , but I believe that these meat registration and labelling schemes will ensure that if we have another disaster in our industry , we can ensure those parts which are not affected , will not be affected . #% I would also thank him for banning personal imports of meat and dairy products into the EU . #% Let us hope , however , that the signature of the memorandum in Sharm el-Sheikh will reinvigorate the peace process and ensure that the outstanding issues on final status are tackled without great delay . #% We recognise that there is a diversity of solutions for different countries , but let us allow them the option of liberalisation . #% The one thing my group can agree on is that the status quo needs to be changed . #% Picking up on the comments of Commissioner Piebalgs , whom I naturally welcome here this evening , I should like to console the Commission for the way in which we and the Council have cut back its text and therefore some of the proposed powers that were envisaged , which we deem unnecessary . #% Madam President , I would have welcomed the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health , like they do in Canada . #% The institutions are being disingenuous to the people they purport to represent . #% Those Conclusions talked about enhancement of corporate social and environmental responsibility , both at EU level and internationally . #% Will you find an appropriate way to report back to Parliament on the responses given . #% Madam President , I want to speak here today as a Member of the European Parliament , and not in terms of nationalist rhetoric . #% It is also about working on health to make sure that we have the collective work done on the flu pandemic preparations . #% Another four million children die from diarrhoea or pneumonia . #% There is a risk of incoherent policies in Member States and the EU . #% The thirteenth transitional article of the Italian Constitution , absurdly labelled `` transitional '' but still in force after 53 years , is not only a violation of European treaties , but also sexually discriminatory in that it applies only to male royal descendants , no matter how far removed , of the constitutional monarch King Victor Emanuel , deemed guilty of signing unacceptable wartime fascist laws . #% Most importantly , if you do not have it , will you do an estimate at Commission level of the costs of not having a single market in the defence sector , in terms of the costs of purchases from overseas that might have been purchased in-house and the costs of having a fragmented and divided defence market in Europe with batch production rather than mass production ? #% Why then did I abstain on the motion as a whole ? #% I just want to say a word to those Members who implied that my actions were somehow irresponsible or inappropriate . #% I would really like to know what we can do from the European Union to try to ensure that the opposition groups - and there are 26 parties standing in the election - have some access to the media . #% Mr Lehne will be coming out with a report and I would like to take this opportunity of stressing that I see the problem Mr Ford is pointing out . #% I should like to thank all the interpreters for staying behind . #% But we still have concerns about the dialogue between the Commission and OLAF in the budget process . #% The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission ' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly . #% I do not know how much more the Commissioner can achieve but we should be seeking reductions in air pollution and we should be giving her our support in her efforts to negotiate them . #% Firstly , it is not a question of if we enlarge , it is a question of when we enlarge . #% I would remind those present that , with our additional safety measures , we in the UK are only exporting to the Community de-boned carcasses which have gone through maximum checks and security . #% The statement has no legal standing before the ECJ , which will now be making decisions that Parliament chose to duck . #% We must do better . #% 
By giving UK businesses the confidence to reach into these markets , this measure will contribute to this aim and will increase trade , growth and employment across both the North West and all of Britain . #% Good as the EU code of conduct is , strengthened as it must be , German armaments used in Burma arrive there only because they were exported via Ukraine , which is not bound by our EU rules . #% I do not whether you think that would be helpful but it might be a first step in breaking the log-jam . #% The pessimists point out that we are in a major crisis , perhaps , I have heard it said , the biggest since the rejection of the EDC Treaty in 1954 . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , in order to be credible and genuinely effective , we have to demonstrate that the GSP + scheme is working properly . #% We have our own standards and our own beliefs in relation to democracy and human rights and we are quite entitled to express those and expect our partners to respect the same principles . #% It was ironic because his next sentence was ` and that is why in Europe , facing the euro crisis , we must reinforce the Community method ' . #% This will preclude any conflict of interests or awkward ambiguity between the partners of this project . #% We can not allow this to slip later into the year . #% This Commission has been completely silent on this issue . #% Is the House sovereign or not ? #% A number of Members were objecting about the filming of signing-in . #% Mrs Gonz√°lez has undoubtedly been a doughty fighter for the citizens of Spain and particularly for the environment of her beloved country . #% I do support , with safeguards , research using human embryonic stem cells and I support Framework 7 resources being spent on this research . #% Another key to helping our young people secure opportunities is to allow flexibility in labour markets so that people can learn on the job . #% Mr President , I shall talk about a very tiny , but nevertheless very important , element of the budget : that of the Committee on Petitions . #% It is a shame that the British have been forced , against their will , to abandon the imperial measure , which of course we share with the United States of America , and which gave us a particular advantage there . #% The urgency of the matter led to the decision to consult the Scientific Committee on Toxicology , which met on 17 November of this year . #% So why on earth are the manufacturers of food supplements being told that they must jump through a series of expensive hoops , which may be so costly as to drive some of them out of business , in order to keep their products on the market ? #% I am not suggesting a new directive , but could the 25 Commission information offices in the 25 national capitals not put the details on their websites and print a one-page leaflet providing the public with real information on their rights , which may be obscured by the airlines ? #% We are not going to escape from the speed of globalisation . #% It is quite extraordinary that they have supported raising the matter of euthanasia in a Member State at European level , and I note this for the forthcoming election campaign . #% I am surprised and somewhat disappointed that MEPs are being less progressive than EU governments , at least on the issue of deadlines . #% Nor should there be any extra levels of decision-making that could interfere with operational effectiveness . #% Thirdly , I believe it damages society because it instils the notion that winning at all costs is the only purpose . #% Can there be any doubt as to which generation has got right the way to work out Europe 's relations ? #% I very quickly persuaded him otherwise . #% Now we are hearing new reports about the targeting of opposition parties and journalists . #% Surely it is time that we made our ban permanent and then led the world and set an example for countries like the United States and Australia ? #% Never in the history of agriculture - and I have been there for quite a long time - have so many healthy animals been destroyed and in such a short period of time . #% There has to be positive action by governments in favour of enabling people to experience working elsewhere : Mrs Van Lancker has already refereed to the coordination of social security systems within this . #% There are many candidate countries that would like to be wearing that maillot jaune , I think they are all wearing them . #% Secondly , the ECB should publish a six-monthly forecast of economic developments in the euro area . #% It demonstrates quite clearly , in a very good response , that the competences of the European Union are not over-done : they are , in fact , finely tuned according to the subject . #% However , as a British Conservative , I do remain worried about its implementation . #% I was the editor of a pamphlet in the '80s which spoke about the pan-European agreements that were being forged vis-√†-vis the participatory democratic relationships inside companies . #% I recommend that we vote on these particular elements which I have put forward as technical adjustments . #% No wonder Mr Cameron 's pledge to leave the PPE-DE Group has become such a huge joke . #% We believe that such rescued illegal immigrants should be taken to the country from which they are believed to have embarked or their home country and left there . #% That is not the case for the majority of vice-chairmen of the committees . #% Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed . #% Does it still carry the endorsement of the Commission as a whole and when are we going to see it ? #% I hope indeed that we will learn the lesson for the future about communicating Europe . ' #% Robert McCartney will never see his children grow . #% My distant relation , T. E. Lawrence of Arabia , once wrote : ' I wrote my will across the sky in stars to earn you freedom , that seven-pillared worthy house . ' #% It is central to our work . #% With regard to drug trafficking , the Iranians , who have a very serious drug problem of their own , should be commended for their efforts and cooperation . #% In a recent study in Kenya 25 % of girls between 15 and 19 were HIV positive and 4 % of boys . #% A concentration on procedural and organisational issues should not blind us to one simple fact : if the political will had existed in Seattle , particularly within the US Administration , the procedural flaws of the system would have been overcome . #% Mr President , I am speaking for my colleague Terry Wynn on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , and as well as on my own behalf in support of my amendments . #% Mr President , the Commissioner said that he felt cheated by the Government of Cyprus . #% I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation on this directive . #% Mr President , first of all let me say to the House that when we , as politicians , begin to trade insults on the issue of war in another place , we lose our purpose which is to drive forward the peace , and that must be our ultimate goal . #% I want to pick up one particular issue and address my remarks to Commissioner van den Broek . #% In principle is the Commission absolutely committed to reoccupying the Berlaymont building ? #% I recognise that advances have been made to ease the financial and administrative burden on SMEs , such as the 2010 establishment of the SMEs finance forum , but urge the Commission to do more in order to create a more competitive and accessible economy for the SMEs which are so vital to the success of Europe 's economy . #% So carry on with your policy . #% In February , the Worldwide Security Conference said that Europe was woefully unprepared for terrorist attacks . #% The Council had already accepted , on 26 October , my own report on universal service and users ' rights , a number of points in which Mrs Reding highlighted . #% Mr President , I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP . #% Our President has visited , Javier Solana has visited , national MPs have visited , MEPs have visited , even Tony Blair has visited . #% We have seen educational changes that have brought about improvements both in Thailand and in Uganda . #% By compelling producers to participate in take-back schemes , this directive will be hard-hitting and effective . #% Finally , Commissioner , the Commission Communication itself suggests self-regulation for LDCs under the GSP . #% My constituency , in the north-west of England , has a long and proud history in the maritime industry , with ports such as Liverpool , Manchester and Heysham numbering among some of the largest on the United Kingdom coastline . #% Belgium has a Federal Advisory Committee on European Affairs , made up jointly of MPs and MEPs . #% 
Secondly , not unrelated to the first point , is the need for strengthened financial controls for the future use of structural funds . #% I believe the President-in-Office shares this conviction and hope she will do so once again today . #% There has been lawlessness , damage to property , and cases of assault and rape without any intervention by the security forces in recent weeks . #% All we , the signatories , want is transparency and proper governmental procedures . #% The old colonialist assumption that the EU and the industrialised countries will keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries , while developing countries focus on lower-skilled sectors , is now open to huge debate . #% The UK is meeting its existing recycling targets , but it is simply not possible to meet and implement this legislation by 2007 without an expensive , crash-spending programme . #% Either way , it is crucial that we settle this tomorrow . #% I am also concerned about the increased powers which MAI will give to multinationals in developing countries , where they will be given almost nation-state status within developing countries . #% In fact , the UK receives the second highest number of requests for surrender after Germany . #% The resolution which I signed on behalf of my group on Tuesday included in the final paragraph a reference to Michelin . #% The EU must continue to support health and education projects in Pakistan so that the poorest people will have a genuine alternative to the madrassas . #% The world has moved on . #% There are other mechanisms for obtaining lengthy answers on complex policy issues from Commissioners . #% In my previous job as managing director of a large UK food manufacturing company , I was very proud to lead the first such company in the whole of the West Midlands Region to achievement of the coveted Investors People Award . #% I was very pleased that the Conservative spokesman on health at that time , Dr Liam Fox , was able to visit Mrs Peel personally to listen to her case . #% So out of the window goes any possibility of introducing urgent Member States ' legislation if national rail safety so requires . #% Sixteen years on , we have Mr Moscovici 's report which shows quite amazing achievements and huge progress . #% It is very good to see both the Commissioners responsible here and I hope they will both have an opportunity to reply in this debate . #% I accept that there are a large number of areas where there is cause for concern in terms of medical research and extremely difficult and serious tests for which no valid alternatives have yet been produced . #% There is currently no consensus on how to take measures , again mentioned by Mrs Laperrouze on the sediment and biota , and until we get the scientific data set on these levels , we need to look very closely at it . #% Minister , I find it absolutely extraordinary that a government such as yours and that of your leader Tony Blair -- who has made such a big play on Africa , what is going wrong in Africa , and what we have to do to try to help Africa -- can be turning a blind eye to this issue . #% The second point is to retain some kind of aid for areas undergoing industrial restructuring . #% As the Commissioner knows , respect for someone else 's language , respect for that person and his or her culture and customs , helps support the integration of those communities . #% Madam President , in July with my colleagues Mr Galeote , Mr Laschet and Mr Morillon I had the opportunity to visit the Middle East . #% The reason it becomes a European issue is because a little bit of that crossed the border into Austria and Switzerland . #% This report has helped correct the imbalance of institutional involvement from the EP and the Commission needs to acknowledge that . #% Furthermore , it is of course extremely difficult to see how they could possibly be policed in practice without having inspectors in every boatyard , every harbour , every port , every river and every canal in Europe , which we are clearly not going to do . #% However , in the scramble for natural resources we must not for instance allow China to collar the Venezuelan oil supplies , for instance , or cease to support the efforts of President Uribe and his fight in Colombia against the FARC drug-dealing Marxist terrorists . #% If the business of rearing livestock for meat continues , and I accept that it will , then I very much believe it should be organic and natural . #% Madam President , it is quite clear that there is a consensus emerging in the Chamber , which gives me no pleasure , and that is the criticism of the Presidency . #% Member States are required to fingerprint every third-country national over 14 who is apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of their border - that is not very precise . #% The US is rightly criticised for its failure to sign up to greenhouse gas reduction targets , but the EU is nowhere near the level of investment that the US is at at present . #% This is an example of how the European Union does need to take a considered look at the advances in equipment . #% Let us name and shame those Member States that are failing , and let us take action against them now . #% That is why during Mrs De Palacio ' s hearing I and my colleagues insisted on questioning her very closely on the flax subsidy scandal in which her department was involved in Spain . #% The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund . #% In committee I even went as far as to propose a joint amendment with Mr Bushill-Matthews saying that the review of the legislation should be used as an opportunity to promote the simplification of legislation and its repeal when it is redundant . #% There are very many bright youngsters who do very well in the schools , but 20 % of young people leave British schools without any qualifications at all . #% The error rate quite simply did not improve . #% The vote tomorrow will determine which way we go . #% We do not agree with the vote in committee about putting an amount in reserve . #% We have also underlined the place of our citizens in the lawmaking process . #% On the role of the consultative forum , there is a lot of real expertise available to Member States , and it seemed obvious to us that such expertise could be valuable . #% The strategy raises serious concerns about the transport implications of enlargement , but the report did not suggest much in the way of concrete measures . #% That is why the Commission as a whole must have the courage to revisit and rebalance the social agenda and to promote employment as a priority , with flexibility in labour markets as the guiding star . #% Much more also needs to be done to implement the Lisbon agenda , as we see Germany now saddled by a deep recession . #% So why is it that we do not make a similar commitment when dealing with third countries ? #% This tends to emphasise the need to harmonise more than is appropriate or necessary in the circumstances . #% Those conclude my comments on behalf of the PSE Group . #% 1999 - what a year that was . #% Surely he can share that with us this evening . #% These are clearly not mutually exclusive . #% Secondly , we must ensure that consumers powerfully use this technology . #% We now face a situation where , according to the European Environment Agency , only the United Kingdom , Germany and Luxembourg reduced their greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 1998 . #% In the Employment Committee report , we also say that the most effective way out of poverty is to give labour market access to all . #% We have insisted very strongly at first reading that the most stringent measures are taken to control gaseous emissions from large combustion plants throughout the Union because of the acid gases that are formed , because of the effects upon the environment , and because of the effects upon human health . #% I would draw attention to one final amendment , which is important . #% It is great to see all the members of your Commission here , but we want to see you working much better together , in more integrated policy-making , in order to tackle that crucial issue that you yourself put at the top of your agenda , which is that of competitiveness , jobs and growth in Europe . #% However , I want to make it clear that there are some parts of this report on which we have grave reservations . #% Some people in this House will also argue that we should never talk to political opponents if we disagree fundamentally with their political and military tactics . #% We should welcome talk of modernisation and reform of the WTO and the recognition that we need seriously to modify the perception that is held elsewhere of the protectionist stance of the industrialised world . #% Secondly and unusually , because it is the third time I have been to Eastern Europe to observe elections , we were not permitted to witness the opening of the ballot boxes and the all-important process whereby a check takes place to see whether the number of ballot papers in the box matches the number of people who have voted . #% The Customs Union is part of the strategy which , as Commissioner van den Broek has indicated , the European Community has been pursuing since 1963 . #% We all know from our experience in flying that no-one takes any notice whatsoever of cabin crew when they are giving us the safety demonstrations and yet all the evidence suggests that information they are conveying to us could make the difference between life or death . #% In this context it also has to be stressed that illegal immigrants whose entry is assisted by traffickers should surely be no more immune to prosecution than other illegal immigrants . #% Madam President , first we should congratulate the Commissioner and ECHO for the aid provided . #% 
Finally , I hope our amendments can be accepted in full in order to avoid codecision and to ensure this legislation , which will do so much to make our seas safer , comes on to the statute book at the earliest possible opportunity . #% One in three of these birds sent for slaughter have fresh broken bones and almost all birds suffer from osteoporosis . #% Vigilance is the key , Mr Liikanen ! #% The euro will benefit that . #% Unfortunately the drive for tax harmonisation in the European Union remains alive as always . #% The duty-free regime is a tax break mainly for the benefit of the alcohol and tobacco industries . #% Madam President , in this Parliament we vote to adopt texts or amendments or not to adopt texts or amendments . #% Mr President , as everyone knows , the leaders of the EU and the American President are meeting in G√∂teborg today . #% The tunnel was closed last Wednesday . #% I ask the Council to ask the Turkish Government - particularly in view of the fact that we now have this customs union which , we were told , would improve human rights in Turkey - whether it would institute a proper inquiry into how a man can die while in police custody and then his body be produced six months later , told it was found in some wood somewhere and the police had nothing to do with it . #% I am not in favour of the proposals to introduce a ban on the import of mercury and mercury compounds . #% We were not happy with the original proposal , although we feel that if Mr Barroso had handled matters better we could have avoided the problems that arose . #% My constituents do not want to see the creation of a federal state called Europe . #% Firstly , we do not feel that in the long run the Commission can be judge and jury on its own impact assessments - assessing its own draft proposals . #% It is a very poignant point : we must prepare for the younger generation because if we allow these young people to wither then the vine dies and with it the industry . #% Once again , and I hope not in vain , we call for the abolition of the death penalty . #% It is very important that we stick to facts and avoid some of the wilder claims that have been put in the Green motion for a resolution on this issue . #% As for this report , it is generally ok . #% Madam President , the CFP has totally failed . #% The hundreds of thousands of World Cup fans now heading home have the same rights and responsibilities , on European soil , to the highest standards of health protection , whether they come from Germany , Jamaica or wherever . #% If we are demanding that businesses provide social and environmental audits , as we quite rightly do , we need the accountants and other professionals than can do that . #% Mr President , I very much appreciate the Commissioner 's statement . #% Thirdly , there should be an agreement on a three-year rolling programme and an annual work programme which should be done jointly between the Commission and the Foundation . #% Fifthly , more research is needed into the causes of violence and how we can prevent it ; how we can educate our children , boys and girls , to solve disputes without violence ; how we can address bullying ; how we can develop mutual respect for the human rights of men and women and how the attitudes and behaviour of violent men can be changed . #% In fact it seems to me that you are a europhile that has been mugged by reality . #% What answers can you give them ? #% It regrets that a recently planned mission to Aceh by political councils from several embassies was cancelled at the last moment by the Indonesian authorities . #% If politicians in Brussels are genuinely worried about disengagement and alienation , as reflected by the votes on the Constitutional Treaty and in other ways , it is right for us to insist that the Commission should strengthen , not weaken , the role of both social partners and of non-governmental organisations in this programme . #% Weakness and equivocation merely strengthen those who seek to undermine democracy . #% I am going to abandon Mr Knapman now . #% I want to emphasise that we agreed this wording because both the Commission and our own legal services advised us that it would make the provisions of the directive enforceable and that Member States could be taken to the European Court of Justice if they failed to take such measures . #% We must not be pompous , hypocritical or self-serving about this . #% What we have done is offer small companies the alternative of doing something else . #% Cooperation from all relevant authorities in Kosovo will obviously be vital in order to establish effective controls on end use and to avoid circumvention . #% We can not support calls for increasing the EU budget . #% I would have liked a recognition of these inter-relationships , but I do not see it . #% As is inevitable , a report will come along that simply demands a different approach and I believe that the Auken report is one . #% I hope this will be listened to . #% There are things that could be improved next time . #% It was interesting that there were six people who decided to vote against it , but through the joys and wonders of technology we were able to name and shame them . #% When it comes to not only fuel but energy as a whole , biofuel and bioenergy may not be the total answer , but it is one of the answers . #% That is what we need , an IGC at the end remains something that can distil the debate ... #% I welcome the fact that all the political groups represented in the conciliation have endorsed the text and that we can finally unleash the benefits of this whole package with our vote tomorrow , because it has now been some months since we worked on it . #% Therefore , perhaps he should vote for our resolution . #% This might be the very first time that anybody has stood up and questioned whether we should plant more trees . #% A pan-European regulator would not have the expertise to deal with transactions and markets as diverse as , for example , the London derivatives market and the many thousands of small German savings and public banks . #% Very often the quality of the product is due to the amount of pesticide with which it has been sprayed . #% Clearly it is not reasonable that they should effectively be rewarded twice at the European taxpayers ' expense . #% This requires a careful mixture , firstly of education , and only when absolutely necessary , of legislation . #% Mr Roche , you concluded your remarks by saying that this process was at its beginning . #% I would urge Commissioner Fischler to look at the way this money can be spent . #% These funds are not and should not be infinite . #% Moreover , intervention in the internal affairs of other states by outsiders can often exacerbate and prolong a conflict , as may have happened in the Balkans . #% I sincerely hope we can reach agreement on one of those amendments in our vote tomorrow . #% We do not necessarily want to rule this out forever , but it is premature to introduce it in this context . #% It is an option open to the President after consulting the chair of the committee responsible , to be used when it will be useful and not to be used when it will not be useful . #% I wonder whether the Commissioner could confirm that any further reduction , which I believe is unlikely in the short term , is unrealistic as an objective and possibly too severe a burden on the chemical industry as a whole . #% I want to deal with the agricultural side because I want to see a proper reform of the common agricultural policy before enlargement takes place . #% We hope those states will liberalise . #% I only say this : we are having to use the Annex III procedure for a very basic reason which I am sure will be understood . #% They most certainly must be involved in quality assurance . #% We should celebrate today , but we should also remember that we must start working hard from now on to make this enlarged Europe work for the benefit of our citizens . #% Why has such a proposal come forward at this stage ? #% Although we may need some of the legislation Mr Hughes has proposed in his report and which the Commission has proposed , without a guarantee of a proper comprehensive and independent impact assessment , the ELDR Group will have to abstain on the vote tomorrow . #% One problem I foresee with organic production generally , not only in Europe but also outside , is that one of these days a TV documentary will be shown following this food production process from beginning to end that finds that the food is perhaps not as organic as it is believed to be . #% If we are to ensure that the European Union flourishes , the citizens of Europe must feel that we have ownership of this project and that we benefit too , not just the commercial organizations and governments . #% 
However , all of this must be looked at in the context of a recent publication by the Commission into its action for road safety proposals . #% The violence has to stop . #% Thirdly , there are 21 prisoners currently in federal death row : 14 are black , 5 are white , one is Asian and one is Latino . #% Also , I am very surprised to see you putting emphasis on the need to increase female participation in small businesses . #% I would repeat what Mr Patten said : we must engage , we must inform , educate and thereby effect real and lasting change . #% Am I right in assuming that command of a police force which is sent by us actually rests in the final analysis with the Council and not with the Commission , even though policing is demonstrably a peacekeeping and not a military operation ? #% Finally , if you asked me : What if there is no life out there among the stars , what if we are alone ? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say : Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly , before letting them go out to populate other planets ? #% Parliament will be debating that later this week . #% I believe that one country has caused this whole problem . #% After the Lisbon Treaty comes into force , the first and third of the so-called three pillars of different policy areas will be consolidated into one . #% This blackmail aims to force the European Union to renege on its obligation to our traditional suppliers to advance the interests of one well-connected corporation , namely Chiquita . #% I want to record the fact that I wished to vote for a different compromise on the length of the period for maternity pay but respect that this option fell because a majority in Parliament supported 20 weeks . #% However we will review it in a few years in the light of experience . #% A hussier went to him but he has refused to move . #% We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the `` polluter pays '' principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced . #% The central fault of the CAP is that it is a common policy , and it is not possible to have one policy covering sub-Arctic Finland , the temperate grasslands of Cheshire , the wine growers of Bordeaux , the arid near-subtropical vegetable growers of Catalonia , or the sheep producers of the mountains of Greece , much less the highly populous Denmark which produces more pigs than people . #% In areas where risk is likely to be a considerable feature of the exchange , dotcoms for example , commercial banking may be deemed inappropriate and unworkable . #% He has taught me and has been an excellent colleague , very thoughtful , critical and precise . #% Both the regulation and the report make sensible proposals , but it is vitally important that we address the key issue , which is labour market flexibility and economic reform . #% We have consistently and actively sought to promote the transfer of goods transport to rail as an alternative to road transport . #% I believe monopolisation of the media to be dangerous and think it is necessary to push for greater freedom in the media across Europe . #% But the threat of unrest should not stand in the way of democracy and we welcome Israel 's decision to facilitate voting in East Jerusalem , where Palestinians have been virtually annexed , split from their families by a separation barrier condemned by the International Court of Justice . #% Both committees took items off their agenda because they were not considered to be urgent . #% The development partnerships are a very clever idea , even though they are experimental . #% We can not see beyond the present : we think everything is still there for the taking and need not consider the consequences . #% More than 150 000 small and medium-sized companies in Britain are being helped today thanks to that money . #% In order to achieve this , we need to ensure the ESF remains part of cohesion policy . #% I am not a Socialist , but if you need an integrated transport system , then state ownership is best - and not separation into multiple private hands . #% However , for millions that is a million miles from their broken , infected and disabled lives , because you can only trade if you can make , grow , sell and distribute . #% This week all my suspicions have been proved absolutely correct . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Hermange for her report -- I shall focus on employment -- and also the Commissioner for his statement this morning . #% The objectives are quite clear : it is about establishing measures to safeguard security of supply and ensure proper functioning of the internal market -- these two elements of the proposal . #% Some Member States seem to have gone into the negotiations with a few calculations on the back of an envelope and refused to compromise in any way to set themselves any realistic targets . #% In this context , the application of the rule of ` regulatory procedure with scrutiny ' allows for ex ante consideration of proposals brought into law . #% Before I make some pertinent comments on the report , I want to pay tribute to my colleague , Mrs Maij-Weggen , who leaves this House this month . #% Is she there because she is good at her job , or is she there because she is part of a quota ? #% Why should not a particular community seek to set up an airport , for instance as a cargo hub , that can experience noise pollution in excess of what a large city should produce ? #% Mr President , I want to talk about one of the annexes to the Council declaration , in particular that on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . #% I can accept the compromise that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has put before us , because it makes sense and it would help us achieve a first reading agreement . #% Lastly in terms of payments , I have mentioned the common foreign and security policy , the CFSP . #% This is a serious omission because women probably represent the greatest potential in this field . #% I am confident these trials will show that the benefits of using this technology go over and above the directive in terms of delivering a 95 % reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions , as against a 40 % reduction which we can achieve through using the fuel . #% I refer to page 30 of the Minutes , which makes reference to the fact that I made an outrageous personal attack on a Member of this House yesterday . #% In terms of the international response , I welcome hearing the Commissioner talking about kick-starting cooperation and particularly mentioning India . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate the Commissioner on the progress he has made on the rapid reaction unit . #% Despite these reservations I see the benefits of common security standards across the Union . #% It is true that it is printed on page 112 of the original proposals . #% The whole process will fall yet further into disrepute , although , given the fact that I , along with many colleagues here , will be campaigning for a ` no ' vote , perhaps I should be grateful for the manner in which you conduct yourselves . #% He said that if we produced a balanced proposal with a strong majority from this Parliament , then the Commission would take that up and produce it as an amended text . #% So we put a huge amount of effort into passing the revised Toys Directive in 2009 . #% We also wanted to broaden the membership of the proposed standing committee for foodstuffs to include experts representing public authorities and consumer groups . #% We should all remember that the financial and human effort needed to construct today 's Union was the most efficient investment ever made on such a scale by countries of a whole continent . #% This has nothing to do with us not wanting the best treatment for sufferers from MS , it has to do with sheer common sense and dealing with things in the appropriate place . #% There are also accusations of widespread abuses by the government against other dissident groups . #% This allows Member States to fulfil their promises the Lisbon agenda , in making appropriate allowances for such businesses , and to set an entrepreneurially sensitive approach . #% That is the first and perhaps most important part of the package of proposals that I tabled before you today . #% As a consultee of Professor John Ruggie on business and human rights , I endorse the requirement in recital Q of the report for companies to undertake due diligence and congratulate the previous Swedish Presidency for putting full support for the UN Special Representatives ' recommendations into the Council conclusions . #% It only remains for me to say , thank you , for us as three ladies , that we managed some progress on this issue . #% Actually , the concept contains a deeper truth , which supporters of this proposal miss entirely or are deliberately concealing . #% A recent report by the economists Ernst [ amp ] Young in the United Kingdom showed the benefits the United Kingdom would receive from enlargement . #% I accept , as you said , that the role of Member States in this matter is crucial . #% As I have always said , Gaddafi remains the Fidel Castro of Africa , although not even Castro would have resorted to such savage violence as we have seen recently from the Gaddafi regime and his sociopathic sons against civilian protestors . #% Those transitory measures should be clearly identified because hopefully we will not need them in a few years ' time . #% Following today 's vote , new rules will need to be put in place to ensure that MEPs from all EU countries take steps to ensure the transparency of their office expenses . #% What is the point of agreeing common laws across Europe if one does not want those laws to be applied across Europe ? #% Moreover , this key advantage - a single passport - has been achieved without some of the less felicitous baggage that was originally contained in a somewhat rushed proposal from the Commission and that would have added to the regulatory burdens , particularly on smaller listed companies . #% 
When the ten new Member States joined in 2004 , they did not get parity . #% A few months later and alas , one of our new representatives disappeared from the scene and from this Parliament . #% I re-opened the World Health Organisation Office and I set up a clinic now dealing with 15 000 medical consultations a month . #% If we do not vote for it , tractor drivers , for instance , will be able to drive their tractor for between 2 to 4 hours in any 8 hour period and that is if we get the 0.8 m/s2 that the rapporteur is suggesting . #% It is an urgent matter and I would therefore request the Commission to make enquiries as to when that report will be presented to the Transport Committee . #% You will not win your constitutional battle by burying the truth and by failing to have a proper debate . #% Third , the issue that concerned the Auditors most was the 80 % of the budget that is spent in Member States . #% In Britain alone some 200 000 young people are set to benefit directly from the EU initiatives over the next five years . #% At the same time , it is right for us to consider more generally the issues of human rights and freedom of the press in Tunisia . #% My worry is about cross-contamination . #% For that reason alone , I am very pleased with this report and the reaction to it . #% Nowadays , we are at peace and people expect to be safe , but too often the European Union is accused of meddling in things that are not important and too much of what the European Parliament appears to do is irrelevant to ordinary peoples ' lives . #% I raised two points . #% We would , however , like to hear about the prospects for a crucial sector . #% I will probably go along with this at the vote tomorrow because I agree that something is better than nothing , but we can only expect only some small improvements , and only potential improvement at that . #% It seems to me that if this had been in the telecommunications sector or elsewhere , the notion that we would have come back with a symbolic fine in circumstances where people had increased their profits by # 200m or # 300m would have been as ludicrous as the symbolic fine appears to football fans . #% I disagree to some degree with my colleague , Mr Pex , who said it was really just the old systems and it was not a great change . #% In the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - and I remind colleagues that this committee was right the first time round - this proposal runs the same risks . #% I supported its location in Japan rather than France as then the Japanese would have wasted their money rather than the EU wasting ours ! #% We need the Council , the Commission and Parliament to bang their heads together to get a resolution on this issue . #% We must see that the European citizens do not vote no , because they understand what the European Union is about . #% Nevertheless , I do accept that others have the right to make their own choices . #% Thirdly , the Court also found that statistical information forwarded by the Member States was inadequate . #% As a rule of thumb we calculate that each British MEP costs UK taxpayers about # 1.2 million annually - that is of course pounds sterling - or just short of # 100 million a year for them all . #% However in a document circulated by Distribution yesterday called ` Activities ' , it says that the Commission 's action plan for the new transit in Europe customs policy should go to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy . #% I would draw particular attention to my own one , which envisages compensation for Strasbourg , because we are not going to get Parliament 's sittings to Brussels without compensating Strasbourg . #% We must also look at other issues concerning our citizens : more and better jobs . #% In so doing , firstly , we would like some clarity about potential new obligations on foreign policy which could arise as a result of enlargement . #% In the proposals from the Women 's Rights Committee , the Environment Committee and the Commission , we have a compromise that I am sure we can work with and will be good for Europe and for a citizens ' Europe . #% Finally , Mr President , I would say that there is already a confusion in the minds of parliamentarians about who is responsible inside the Commission for key elements of this problem . #% Montenegro is a small country but a beautiful country , which has enjoyed remarkable stability and economic growth since its peaceful divorce from Serbia . #% This House has made it very clear that it wishes that investors be given access to a wide range of different equities . #% Can we please have a consistent ruling on this matter ? #% Mr Whitehead 's report is yet further proof of Europe cleaning up its act and putting the safety of our citizens first . #% This is a workable interim solution pending final resolution of the whole matter of delegated legislation in 2004 , when Parliament could and should ask for a legally binding call-back mechanism , which is desirable but , sadly , not permissible within the terms of the current Treaty and arrangements . #% That is the area on which we should now concentrate our attention . #% We need to see a radical rethink in the European Union about how we ensure that we listen to children and invite children to participate , because we understand that it is children themselves who give lives to the values that are enshrined in international law through the Convention on the Rights of the Child agreed in 1989 . #% By its own admission , the Commission believes its proposals will lead to a substantial deepening of economic and monetary union . #% There is a problem and we should work with Mr Lehne and in the committee to ensure that problem is sorted out . #% We are seeing this with Iraq . #% There are two things that need to be dealt with : the protection of children and young people and making sure that women are not portrayed in unacceptable ways in these video productions . #% Mr Camre , the rule of law is not an enemy , but the basis of a civilised society . #% We can not demand that , for example , the European Environment Agency provide environmental indicators to enable us to link common agricultural policy reforms to the achievement of environmental goals if their budget is not adequate . #% Myanmar should accede to the mine ban Treaty immediately and Bangladesh should take steps to ratify the Treaty . #% Turning to the annual programme , other colleagues will speak on the Eurostat issue later . #% And , for heaven 's sake , do not let us turn around and start blaming you for not actually getting to 2004 on time . #% Israeli withdrawal was met responsibly by the Lebanese . #% However , this seemed to be a no-go area for the Commission as a whole , as if to say that , if it dared to challenge proposed social legislation , this might signify that it did not care about social justice and social cohesion . #% But we are not in this Parliament trying to guess the outcome of the IGC ; we are trying to encourage it to move in a particular direction , in a more ambitious direction , to make sure that we actually have a Union capable of functioning effectively when we enlarge to nearly 30 Member States . #% We want to see a bigger role for national parliaments , on a systematic and constructive basis . #% There were not very many of us here , a lot fewer than there are today , when we introduced these regulations in the first instance . #% I am minded to speak on this today because a month ago , I was at the Palace of Westminster . #% We should take direct action against assets that President Mugabe owns outside of Zimbabwe . #% I , as a British Conservative , often find fault - and it is very easy to find fault - with many of the programmes organised and paid for by the European Commission and the European Union . #% No , they made life tougher and tougher : they put tens of millions into poverty ; they denied people a say and , in the end , those people had to resort to violence to get back their nation states and their democracies . #% I hope , Commissioner , you will take note of that . #% I have not heard one word of condemnation of Iraqi troops killing their own people in Basra . #% On the basis of its Green Paper on convergence and Parliament 's response in the form of the Paasilinna report , it will provide a framework that will contain light and simple regulation to promote economic and industrial objectives such as competition and interoperability . #% It is this category of implementing act where we delegate the right to adopt certain types of act to the Commission . #% We are all pleased to see the rules have been tightened up to prevent it being abused and used as a loophole for piracy ; that is something that we would also support . #% The European Union is a giant machine for negotiating agreements between 25 countries and everything relevant should be considered negotiable if positive benefits can be secured in return . #% Can the Council , in particular , give an assurance that it will step up its efforts to put pressure on the American Government to close it down once and for all , which is , indeed , what Parliament has called for ? #% I do not want it . #% It does not matter how much style and gloss you put on a project , because if the substance is rotten then it will fail . #% And so long as people do not have equality before the law , this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded . #% If the Union insists on the same procedure for the first and second parts , what is the point of splitting the Treaty in the first place ? #% 
Indeed there might be further ways of simplifying them when we are not having an electronic or roll-call vote . #% It is a splendid piece of legislation . #% Thirdly , we wish to improve access of the citizen to the European Court so that the citizen will be a privileged litigant with ourselves , Member States and companies . #% The rest -- including the EU citizens involved -- are undoubtedly dangerous or a source of ongoing useful intelligence and should either be tried for war crimes , if appropriate , at standards compatible with international norms or held in humane conditions as illegal combatants for the duration of the war , with Red Cross and consular access , until Mr Osama bin Laden is captured and formally surrenders his terrorist network and their declared war on the West . #% The CSTEE met and decided on 25 November . #% During the passage of this budget we in the Conservatives and the European People 's Party tried to indicate that we needed better and tighter accounting control . #% My thesis is threefold . #% We have pictures on our TV almost every day of child soldiers fighting in conflicts throughout the world . #% The test has not been passed . #% On paragraph 14 , there are a number of references to other stages in the development of SMEs in their business cycle . #% Indeed , the future of European integration depends upon the interest and support of the next generation , and since war is not at the forefront of young people 's minds - and will no longer act as a catalyst for integration - it is vital that we include them now . #% I look forward to supporting this report . #% Mr President , it is clear from the debate here this morning and in yesterday 's discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that Parliament is divided into two camps . #% Since the Council was not able to be more specific , I should like to ask the President-in-Office if he would be prepared to welcome a Commission proposal designed to secure such a development in developing countries and countries in transition with respect to bribery and corruption ? #% It is the first , but it is behind schedule and it is a small sum of money : far too small for the Commission 's list of glamorous priority projects that Commissioner Patten , whom it is very nice to see still here , read out earlier . #% It is hoped that its revolution -- if it is a revolution -- will place it on a firm path to democracy , respect for human rights and good governance . #% That is the reality of bringing Europe closer to the people . #% Furthermore , ` right to roam ' legislation will give the British public the freedom to enjoy and appreciate our beautiful countryside . #% Will the Council consider in due course extending this decision , so that all legislation is enacted in public ? #% However , we reject the implication that the EU should replace Member States as the major actor in the process . #% Mr KellettBowman makes reference to a memorandum of understanding to be signed by the two directors . #% This is a truly worldwide issue . #% That is social policy as a productive factor , contributing to competitiveness , contributing to quality at work , quality jobs , and maintaining people 's active involvement in the labour market . #% Mr President , it is always a pleasure to hear a committed rapporteur and a committed Commissioner speaking on their common concern in this matter . #% However , the arbitrary creation of new projects and organisations to facilitate these goals runs counter to the budgetary realities evident across the EU . #% The final agreement with Council now includes a provision on drawing up pilot studies that will enable Member States to show the effects of tourism on the economy and on employment , which I hope will contribute to a better understanding of the true size and value of our tourism industry . #% It has a clear agenda and is willing to consider novel solutions drawing on sound experience from other countries . #% I happen to believe that despite all these wonderful aspects of modern technology , we will continue to need paper for our reading , because it is the medium that most people are still comfortable with and I certainly am . #% It is true that the EU has been unable to implement human rights and democracy clauses in its agreements . #% How could anybody decide on a strategy for Albania when the Council of Ministers had 15 different briefing documents ? #% I agree that it has the potential to play a role , but only provided any scheme is properly designed . #% Can I be told at whose request , and what reasons were given for withdrawing that ? #% I am pleased that the Commissioner is ambitious enough to say that we must see a significant breakthrough in 2004 . #% I look forward to my new Labour colleagues voting on this particular matter . #% Last night , I understand , the Agriculture Council not only adopted a position on the Papayannakis report resolution , which it was rather beforehand in doing - but it also , I believe , altered the legal basis of the text on which Mr Papayannakis drew up his report . #% Violence affects the victim , their families and children . #% It has been suggested that those who have signed this hotly worded declaration were behaving irresponsibly . #% That dossier makes for some interesting reading . #% However , questions have been raised over whether the Globalisation Adjustment Fund can be used or not . #% In his speech the President-in-Office mentioned that employment is a key goal of the British government . #% You are changing the vote around and reversing it . #% It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the Member States ' annual national plans for employment . #% These diseases are major killers but they need not be . #% Would it not be better to put this proposed European Constitution to a democratic vote in every country in the European Union and let the people , not professional politicians , decide their destiny ? #% It can not be morally sustainable to open negotiations with Turkey and with western Balkan countries and deny such a right to Ukraine . #% I find it very interesting that players now have different rights depending on their age - 23 being the case in point here . #% Why is this so , Commissioner ? #% I should like to propose orally that we delete the word `` Community '' and insert instead the words `` Budgetary Authority '' , so that the amendment would now read : `` The Budgetary Authority shall each year set a global ceiling for funding action under this Regulation . '' #% Mr President , this EU-Mexico agreement gives me an opportunity to say that it makes a lovely change for the European Parliament to be discussing free trade , something to which it usually pays just lip service . #% As my colleague , Mr Wynn , said here on another occasion , being unelected and almost always meeting in secret and therefore not being subject to supervision by the budgetary or legislative authorities , these committees may subvert the legislative process . #% It really is time that we had an answer to that . #% It is within living memory that we have had to fight the battle of the Atlantic and we have had to live on a knife-edge for freedom because continental countries seem to find it impossible to live together . #% The people who are afraid of the problem should be mindful of the fact that this is a much bigger problem than opening up borders at this stage . #% Let those deliberations be thorough and the negotiations candid and well-informed . #% In fact , I am so confident that on 31 December 2006 I shall be buying my ticket to Bucharest in Romania . #% The report calls on the Commission to promote best practice , to encourage the exchange of views and experience , to encourage increased public awareness while respecting the principle of subsidiarity . #% If we stand here and do nothing , we condone these undemocratic attitudes . #% May I ask the President of the Council and the Commission , in accordance with the clearly expressed wishes of this House over a year or more , to insist that sanctions be renewed unequivocally and that the EU measures be extended to include all of those involved in this racket in Zimbabwe and the Congo . #% And all that time I thought the Commissioner was out there trying to save the world ! #% Secondly , if there is to be a financial perspective , we welcome the ideas that the President has put forward today about better flexibility , categorisation and looking ahead to how money will be properly spent . #% If an airport , for instance , is located in the centre of a city , then the limit values that should be acceptable there are completely different to those at an airport located out on a peninsula in a quiet rural area . #% This is essentially a matter of the safety , as well as of the convenience , of the consumer . #% We are no further forward on this . #% How is it that somebody who is not present and has not taken part in the vote can submit an explanation of vote ? #% He is right to say that the coalition against terror would not have been possible without the progress we have made within the EU to bring about that unity and coherence . #% It would be better if the future of Europe was entrusted to elected representatives who can be dismissed from office at elections and not to nominated bureaucrats in the form of Commissioners . #% 
I have a letter from you , Madam President , dated 6 April , in which it was agreed by the College of Quaestors that the area around the Chambers in Brussels and Strasbourg should be regarded as a neutral zone in which demonstrations , exhibitions or similar activities intended to influence Members would not be tolerated . #% The effectiveness of the IPP strategy will be severely curtailed unless the Commission explicitly recognises the reforms that would be needed to the World Trade Organisation in particular , to enable its measures to be set out . #% I would like to congratulate the Commission not only for keeping pace with international maritime law but transposing it into Community legislation to ensure that it is effective throughout our European waters . #% The phrase ` just a housewife ' needs to be outlawed . #% Therefore , we have to accept the Commission 's recommendations that we should proceed with five countries in addition to Cyprus . #% The rules are too often institutionalising the current system of global inequality . #% Certainly , when I try to explain to the small farmers what is happening here , they look at me as if I do come from that planet . #% In 1999 there was a substantial under-spend on that and I am pleased to see that in 2000 it was almost fully committed including the overhang from 1999 . #% Her support has been very helpful during this procedure . #% I joined this Parliament in 1989 and I was Parliament 's first rapporteur , along with Mr Cox , on economic and monetary union . #% In particular in the ceramics sector we have a policy in the European Union of encouraging employment , and having a resolution which will tax one sector unilaterally is going to be very difficult . #% It looks as though North Korea got the blueprints from Pakistan , but the Americans have produced no evidence that it has an ongoing programme . #% I would like to thank him personally for taking on board many of our concerns , not least in the area of safety , which I acknowledge is now the number one priority for him in his report . #% We need a broader-based strategy to cover all renewable and carbon-beneficial fuels . #% I also strongly commend the much larger numbers of staff for their diligent commitment in coping with extensive reorganisation and innovation - much of it very complex and testing - and simultaneously fulfilling the primary tasks of the Commission . #% You will recall that in my report I attached great importance to the need to reform the standing pensions policy to introduce a permanent early retirement scheme . #% What is not normal is the way we do it in the European Union where we set up , alongside the Commission , committees of national civil servants which , in some cases , have the powers to block the Commission . #% I am delighted it is going to be remedied , because if every small - and medium-sized company across Europe creates one more job over the next five years , we will have met that job creation goal . #% These include , in particular : the need for more recognition of the diversity of rural areas ; greater clarity on the activities to which the individual axes are addressed ; fuller attention under Axis 1 to forestry , the fuel chain and renewable energy resources ; additional detail under Axis 2 as to the environmental goods to be promoted , including preservation of the cultural , as well as the natural , heritage ; and a heavier emphasis under Axis 3 on measures to improve the quality of life and social inclusion in rural areas in parallel with , and as an aspect of , maintaining and developing employment . #% There is a window of opportunity there and I very much hope the Council and Commission will use this opportunity to try and do something to alleviate the terrible suffering which is taking place in Sudan . #% That is unacceptable : tiredness kills , and failing to modernise these proposals would be irresponsible . #% - My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments . #% It is said that there is a need for greater competition in this sector to promote growth and job creation , but if this directive is applied , at what expense ? #% We look forward to hearing the Commission 's reply to set the framework for that , but this is just the beginning of the process and I am sure that the new Commissioner will be able to take that forward and work with us to really develop this crucial piece of legislation and make the single market work better . #% What answer do you give him and where can this paragon be found ? #% However , the issue of an absolute ban on the death sentence remains a conscience based issue for individual MEPs . #% I would also like the Commissioner to comment on the effects of the Council 's derogations . #% How can the many people and organizations who have an interest in the outcome of the ICG possibly consider the issues surrounding the draft treaty and give advice to us in this Parliament and to the national governments if there is this stone wall of silence from the Council . #% I wish I had more conviction that within the Commission there was agreement that this really should be considered and done . #% My conclusions , as a result of this , are that ( a ) there should be no immunity for Commission officials ; ( b ) that UCLAF ought to be separated from the Commission completely and made an independent body ; ( c ) the Court of Auditors ought to be ashamed of the two reports it produced on the subject . #% There are tasks that ought to be carried out at national level and some that need to be carried out at European level . #% Surely it would be an improvement to follow the logic of what you propose for foreign and security policy , which is the virtual cloning of Mr Solana and Mr Patten , and to follow that practice in the other two areas where the Council enjoys executive authority . #% It is well known that something that you give but which can not be disposed of has little value to the receivers since they have made no effort to get it . #% If Mr Titford had still been in the Chamber , I would have liked to take him up on his comment that Commissioner Fischler and the European Commission were to blame for the mishandling of the foot-and-mouth crisis . #% I hope that we use our intelligence in this question and realise the importance of these substances in protecting human life as flame-retardants . #% It allows these four countries to have a veto on any changes to the system . #% However , the Bullmann report calls to our attention that all these measures come to absolutely naught if we do not have an educated citizenry that can create , operate and service these sectors . #% This essentially means that there will be no physical costs of actually exchanging currencies , notes and coins , for other currencies . #% This in turn means that all Member States , Britain , France , Belgium and the others alike , must ensure that there are proper systems in place and that the laws are enforced . #% So the Commission needs to submit a full report on maximum permitted levels . #% Also , what happens if a derogation is negotiated within the accession negotiations which the EFTA/EEA countries are not happy with ? #% Many of the diseases and ailments from which people are currently suffering can be cured by various therapies that can be derived from this sector . #% Reducing the EU 's voice to one may , in certain circumstances , have an explicit effect on the weight of international opinion . #% I should like to make clear that the Socialists have tried to be consistent in their approach to this budget . #% I hope we can rely on you . #% This inspectorate will also visit packing stations and build up a database of the processors who use these battery cage eggs in their products . #% As a confirmed philhellene , I believe Greece has contributed massively to our Union . #% We do not consider that meeting the requirements of the ERRF should be the `` absolute priority '' for defence procurement . #% The Nuremberg precedent reminds us that a torturer is a torturer even if you are in a uniform and you have accepted an order to torture one of your fellow men or women . #% I , the PSE Group , the ELDR Group and other Groups will uphold those principles . #% Mr President , I must say to the last speaker that , as somebody British , I can confirm that my ancestors had absolutely nothing to do with the oppression or repression of the people of Zimbabwe . #% Yet in the United Kingdom it was on satellite television , where the majority of people could not even watch it . #% However , we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition . #% The operation of joint investigation teams , say between Italy and ourselves , or with the participation of the French expertise in this area , would help to bring this sort of appalling offence to an end . #% Europe will not truly influence America or world affairs unless we are able to resolve our differences and speak with a common voice . #% I have many Nigerians living in London , my constituency . #% I have been involved in meetings with our UK Government representatives and know they are listening to the concerns . #% We have looked at the impact so far made by the Charter as a solemnly proclaimed instrument and we have found that much use is made of it by the Ombudsman , by Parliament , by the Commission and even sometimes by the Council . #% The impact of legislation , for example , is completely global . #% They have elected governments . #% We need people ! #% The new countries have a right to criticise the European Union . #% Mr President , we return for the second time today to the grave crisis over beef , its safety and circulation within this Union under the rule of law . #% We broadly support this view . #% Opposition politicians go in fear of their lives . #% As fish stocks closer to Europe are depleted , Community fishermen are increasingly looking further afield for new fishing areas , like the Antarctic , to exploit . #% 
The sort of forced displacement that we have seen in Colombia I have seen too in Chiapas in southern Mexico where the presence of international aid workers is essential for the protection of human rights . #% Mr President , before I start on the subject of tyre noise , may I make a more general point to the Commission . #% That is a major step forward , but we need you to go out there and advocate it in a strong and positive way . #% Sadly another minister , the Deputy Minister for Electricity , Mr Raad al-Hareth , was kidnapped this morning with 19 bodyguards . #% I support colleagues who argue that NGOs like the RSPCA could help overcome the budget restrictions which the Commissioner spoke about . #% We agree that the Commission lacks sufficient resources to monitor effectively the implementation and quality of the common asylum policy . #% We all have our voting lists in front of us , we were sent here to vote on these issues , so can we now get on with it ? #% I am sure that the President-in-Office has noticed that five of the first 16 questions on the order paper , the previous question from Mrs Frassoni , and so on , are all about transparency . #% Our group has no problem in supporting the wish for an Arctic treaty , but more in the light of a quest for a new mode of governance . #% We support exchange of information to ensure that we have a true JHA approach to the use of data , underpinned by strong data protection , founded on principles of proportionality , necessity and transparency . #% We are talking here about the donors , the question of screening , evaluation and testing and also the question of research and diagnostic tests . #% So I am in favour of that section of the amendments . #% Also , we should introduce an independent complaints mechanism for individuals or communities who consider that their interests have not been represented . #% That is the answer we need . #% I support the rapporteur 's suggestion that it is now up to Turkey to give us a timetable for concrete reforms to demonstrate just how serious they are with their application . #% The ECR Group feel that this resolution takes a ` victim-centred approach ' which prescribes how Member States should look after victims once they have been trafficked , thus assuming that the incidence of human trafficking is inevitable . #% If the Council wishes to encumber itself with unanimity upon financial questions , that is its own problem , but it can not be permitted to evade parliamentary accountability . #% If the current directive is not being implemented satisfactorily in all Member States , could the Commission please consider taking a bit more time out to understand why ? #% We have a budget system that is overly complicated , but my question is : do we need a budget at all ? #% Let us do more work in sport to bring our communities together . #% If they fail to learn , then I am confident that Parliament will put forward another helpful amendment in due course that will not be voted down . #% So what solutions do we have ? #% The PPE-DE Group has tabled two amendments to the report that was adopted in committee . #% Like every other applicant , Turkey 's candidature must succeed or fail on those same principles . #% We see reports that some countries which claimed a year ago to be BSE-free , now anticipate up 500 cases in the course of the next year . #% I commend him on the amount of work he has put into this . #% It is a challenge that Parliament must rise to , working with the other institutions , Commissioner Prodi and his colleagues , and the Council . #% We must ignore the fact that the Spanish bond market is telling us that they are going to be next . #% Where Europe stops should not be a question of geography but of liberal values and democratic practices , clearly defined and brightly illuminated so that the candidate countries know where the European journey will bring them . #% Works councils should provide a bridge between employers and employees . #% Later in the report , it talks about ` EU-wide coordination ' of ` direct taxation ' . #% This entire Chamber should therefore have no hesitation in condemning those abuses of human rights , as it should condemn the obstructions to free journalism that have taken place since the elections . #% I have an interest here , as my kinsman T. E. Lawrence sought and expected Arab autonomy . #% With this has come press censorship and imprisonment of journalists , including recently a Swedish citizen . #% Further reform of security services and the judicial system and further progress in implementing new human rights legislation are essential . #% Refrigeration permits this . #% After all , a later statute succeeds its predecessors and , if the form of protection the consumer is given needs overhauling , earlier legislators can not and do not stop the draftsmen and their successor legislators . #% My worry is that when we have voted on this , it will remain on a shelf somewhere doing nothing . #% I am rather sorry for him , but he is here to try to convince the House that the Presidency is on top of events . #% By the time that happens there will not be a European civil aviation industry left to put on that level playing field ! #% It is clear that Hizbollah seriously miscalculated the scale of the retribution when it decided to kill eight soldiers and kidnap two from northern Israel . #% They do not visit clients , they just come here to misrule Europe . #% I am also puzzled about the role the Greek air force has reportedly had in reviewing the charges as opposed to an independent prosecutor . #% I also oppose those who wish to make a reference to religion in the Constitution . #% As President Bush said earlier this week in Poland , the common values that underpin that transatlantic relationship are the common foreign policy element that can bring the European Union together with the USA . #% Finally , as other speakers have said , we must take forward the Agenda 2000 proposals because it is very important if we are to keep enlargement on track that we complete the legislative procedures before June 1999 . #% I am also perturbed by the weeping and gnashing of teeth by Members of Parliament over the CFSP . #% He now seeks the right , through the referendum , to become President for life . #% Burma is now the world 's largest producer of heroin and significant parts of the country are controlled by drug lords , and I am concerned at China 's role in facilitating this process . #% Indeed , by 2002 we will have connected every school in Britain to the Internet . #% I warmly congratulate the Greek Presidency on its conference on managed migration in Athens last month , because the statistics are stunning : Europe is set to lose 15 % of its population by 2050 . #% I did not believe that the Council and the Commission could actually be serious about this . #% Funded occupational retirement schemes in the EU cover 25 % of the EU workforce and are currently valued at more than EUR 2 500 billion . #% The Committee on Fisheries would like you to think again about your acceptance of amendments . #% The most important aspect of investment for vessels in the future is not that the EU should provide money for reinvestment . #% For those of you that are not so technologically enabled , Linux is a competitor to Windows that is owned and updated by the users . #% After all , we spent all of last year , 2010 , dealing with questions of poverty . #% However , there is a caveat ; it is contained at the end of the explanatory statement to my report and set out in more detail in our chairman 's motion for a resolution . #% Turkish Cypriots are trapped in a pincer : they are threatened on the one hand by Turkish settlers and on the other by the economic strength of the Greek Cypriots . #% Firstly , I am grateful for the kind remarks by Mr Casaca because they are based on very thorough analysis of everything we are seeking to do . #% Where I come from , the state does not exist in its own right and the government of the day answers to us : those who elected it . #% The first is an important provision that not only benefits citizens , but also encourages in a practical way the development of the single market . #% As I have been saying for the last five years , we have to find better ways of getting ministers who sign up to these agreements to keep to their word . #% The deregulation of financial markets in many member countries has meant that trillions of pounds and dollars can now flow across international borders to seek a return for those investors . #% Mr President , in my country secret cabinet papers are released 30 years after the discussions to which they refer took place . #% This proposal states that its aim is to create a European judicial area which will bring tangible benefits to every citizen . #% 
We need to support our farmers , but not at the expense of Third World trade . #% It also allows for the launch of preparatory actions for the development of a European policy in the area of network and information security . #% The committee also welcomes the possibility of financial assistance being made available where any Community legislation imposes technical restrictions , but feels that Parliament should be kept informed of such cases - that is Amendment No 10 . #% Very few of us wanted to stand up and say anything at the time . #% The committee has rejected some of the key proposals from the Commission on mobile air conditioning . #% If I am wrong , let him put this on the record today , and if I am right let him support our amendments . #% To organise an orchestra which draws its players from the top conservatories across Europe requires a great deal of organisation and forward planning . #% If the European Union can not organise itself to give assistance , or simply will not , why should any other organisation be thinking of doing so ? #% I think if we go on for a few more minutes then these points of order will get Mr Byrne here in time for the debate . #% However , the real issue is , firstly , that we have to get some sort of agreement up and running and , secondly , that we have to move forward . #% Of the two , I am more embarrassed in respect of the assistants ' statute because this is a case where as MEPs we are directly responsible in matters affecting the lives of others . #% We also have to recognize three other issues essential for the effective working of a code of conduct . #% Will you make this a key objective of the British presidency ? #% Ministers are calling for a 2008 date for the UK and some of the other states . #% Well now we are back , offering the Council a clear and acceptable package . #% After all , we all share a common interest in fighting international terrorism . #% In modern Europe , quite simply , they are not . #% It is one factor of deprivation which , along with unemployment , poverty , social isolation and inadequate education and training , blights the lives of millions of European citizens . #% Nevertheless , it may well be that the international cosmetics industry draws back from a WTO challenge if they know that the full glare of public scrutiny is focused on testing ingredients on animals . #% As you know , safety at sea , far from reaching higher levels , is declining . #% Finally , he did not cover my point about twinning . #% That is the area that most perturbs the people of Bulgaria as well as our own citizens . #% The final thing I would just say is certainly from this side of the House . #% That is a tool which has not achieved a great deal of success so far . #% However , we abstained in the face of omissions and many unhelpful elements , for example : #% If we doubt the value of those characteristics we only have to look at the former Yugoslavia . #% Representatives from the two groups -- the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement -- declared on Monday their commitment to a ceasefire and to unconditionally resuming talks with the Sudanese Government . #% Third and finally we want to see swift action to tackle the scandal of flags of convenience which are a disease , a plague , spreading throughout the world 's shipping industries , and here in Europe too . #% I would also like to ask what action has been taken against contractors to secure some damages . #% Of course , the Treaty lacks the simplicity of its late , lamented predecessor , but it preserves all the principal reforms . #% I would like to seek assurances from you today , Commissioner , that in no shape or form can this package be used as a bail-out for the nuclear industry in a way which would prejudice other energy sources and give unfair preference to the nuclear industry in the European energy single market . #% I hope that this report will assist many of my constituents and citizens from across Europe who have been affected by this , in their battle for justice . #% However , if the experience of its predecessor , the EUMC , is anything to go by , this agency will not help in the achievement of these worthy goals , having shown in the past that it is susceptible to political manipulation . #% Even if I do not necessarily agree with all the conclusions he reaches , I pay tribute to all the work he has done and for his understanding of the issues . #% We do not accept the argument that price makes no difference to the amount of cigarettes consumed . #% The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union ' s disputes resolution procedures . #% . On behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party , can I stress that we strongly support human rights and the call for free elections in Zimbabwe . #% All of these institutions are now accountable under Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 . #% I believe we will reach a compromise with the Council , because the Commission has shown that it is willing to try to initiate that compromise . #% Going back to my original point , what this is really about is making sure that the European Union ' s telecommunications industry has a climate in which it can thrive and survive and remain competitive . #% The expenses regime is going to be cleaned up and , while there is not an entirely clean break with the past , the anomalies are such that I do not assess them to be very great and they will of course waste away over time . #% Equally , it gives the right to vote in local elections . #% We shall welcome him here tomorrow . #% As Mr Bowe said , this is a very good and much-needed proposal and I welcome it . #% I would ask the Commission to watch this space very carefully . #% Mr President , Commissioner , the dark clouds of recession are looming in the west , in part due to the piercing of the asset bubble of the US stock market , but further exacerbated by the tragic events of 11 September . #% This would then , hopefully , provide the UK and other Member States with an ideal opportunity to push for broader and further reform of the controversial common fisheries policy . #% Let us subsidise each other ! #% Yet tonight Parliament joins Council and Commission in expressing our deep concern that what is closed instead with December 's Constitutional Court decision is the political party which commands the majority of the vote in the country 's Kurdish majority areas , and is what the country 's human rights association calls the ` natural negotiator ' on behalf of the Kurdish people . #% What justice is there when , under the European arrest warrants , national courts have been stripped of their powers to protect their own citizens from unjust arrest and imprisonment ? #% Because we are coming into this late , there is no excuse for not getting it right . #% However , we can always rely on its cowardice and craven surrender to the EU . #% This is a very good illustration of the inherent link between economic and monetary union and political union . #% I wonder whether the Commission is actually considering a more positive agenda with regard to companies who are making profits out of this at the moment , by perhaps insisting that unless European companies -- and do not forget that Europeans and North Americans consume most of these cocoa products -- can give a guarantee that they are not making their products and profits on the back of child labour , then they can not import them into Europe . #% I ask him to reflect during the course of negotiations on whether or not we should give it a higher priority when one in four poor families in developing countries have a disabled member ; when there are only 3 % of the 500 million disabled people worldwide who are literate ; when the mortality rate for under-fives in developing countries is well under 20 % - it is between 60 % and 80 % for disabled children . #% That is why we have tabled Amendments Nos 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17 , to ensure this measure applies to all the cabin crew . #% If we can establish these minimum standards of donor consent , we will protect the vulnerable individuals who could be persuaded into donating cells under pressure . #% Mr President , this is not the first time this has happened , but it seems to suggest a rather curious practice that we have adopted . #% Does the Commissioner not agree that the problem raised by Mrs Billingham clearly illustrates that tourism ought to have a competence within the European Union - as many of us have argued - in the revision of the IGC , so that in the case of the free movement of people , as is exemplified by this problem , we can have common rules which actually ensure the safety of tourists ? #% ... and as the weakness of the Stability Pact becomes more obvious , the chances of us ever joining are becoming more and more remote . #% I also agree on the public amenity areas ; but we also need to look at private institutions that are caring for people who are socially excluded - such as prisons and private nursing homes - to ensure universal access for these people as well . #% The challenge posed by China raises some fundamental questions about the logic and direction of free trade itself and it demonstrates the destruction that happens when a country has not just a comparative advantage but a more or less absolute advantage in so many areas . #% Just as the last part of the twentieth century belonged to the countries of south-east Asia , the Tiger economies , I believe that the first part of this century can belong to the countries of south Asia . #% It is a different scheme in concept and application from the Commission 's proposal , and we should be able to learn and benefit from it in the long term . #% I apologise for not spotting the technicality in committee . #% Let us not forget that we have to convince the people that enlargement is in their interests . #% 
Therefore , this should not be used as a pretext for pursuing the objective of full communitarisation in this area . #% This proposed directive will also ease the situation with - as the rapporteur explained - the deadline requirements and the penalties for non-compliance with the deadline . #% Mr Prodi , your paper on European governance is an important milestone , but on a technical issue my colleague , Mr Dell ` Alba , pointed out to you in a previous debate that , while the word ` governance ' may be very common in the English and French languages , in Italian political culture it is to some extent opaque . #% Surely it is time for the Commission and the Council of Ministers to do likewise in our common cause of fighting international terrorism . #% For the first time in 25 years of trying , international standards were set on the human rights of those vulnerable to racial discrimination . #% Mr President , since this voting session is a continuation of the lunch-time voting session , would I be correct in thinking that the few roll-call votes in which we have participated this afternoon will count as part of our daily count , and that this has direct relevance to the earlier vote on whether we had a quorum or not ? #% Mr President , it is very important indeed that the Council and the Commission think very carefully about the meeting that is being held and the meetings that will be held in the future on the macroeconomic dialogue . #% We are particularly pleased that the issue of donations has been settled , and that a clear , transparent and limited system where any donation to a political party is limited in level and also has to be registered on a register is laid down in the text . #% EU farmers are required to meet stringent environmental and animal welfare standards , for which they are , in part , compensated through the subsidy system . #% It is also using voucher-for-work schemes , covering activities such as the removal of animal carcasses , drying of slaughtered meat and reforestation . #% Am I the only one here to think that the behaviour in the Commission in relation to transparency in competition cases has been quite odd ? #% I thank the Commissioner for that reply . #% It is estimated that thousands of women and children will be trafficked during that time and used for forced prostitution . #% The chapter on the rights of the child includes a project to promote the rights of children in the New Independent States . #% Could Parliament perhaps consider giving Members detailed instructions on how to use the tram system and the routes that are available , and maybe even give us a couple of complimentary tickets to get us started . #% I am heartened , however , by the lead that the Danish Presidency is trying to give and I would like to thank Minister Frederiksen in particular for a most helpful letter that he sent me on 18 September . #% Should the proposals of the Ecofin Council be allowed to prosper at the IGC , this Parliament will be reduced to a pale mockery . #% I welcome much of Mr Andria 's report , with those three minor reservations . #% I am aware that it is being discussed in the crime prevention network , but it seems to me that there is scope for further action . #% Let the Essex County Council Library Service be a European information centre . #% In fact , they have become accustomed to this . #% Which is the one Member State which we do not need to lobby ? #% Failure to meet the environmental targets that we have already agreed to would fundamentally undermine Europe 's credibility in the area of sustainable development . #% The EU has a record of setting very ambitious targets and a 100 % record of failing to achieve them . #% It will not be a cost-cutting exercise by any means . #% Forced removal of a customer 's Internet connection , without judicial oversight , is not the right solution to combating piracy . #% As a result we now have a situation in which there is adequate protection for the consumer both when dealing with the issue of goods that may turn out to be faulty even if those are in part manufactured by the consumers themselves . #% We want this to be set up without delay . #% You are proposing the atypical workers ' directive which , instead of promoting job flexibility , will help to kill it off . #% We can not expect real lasting peace in the region unless they are able to play their full and proper part in the dialogue . #% Madam President , it is on record that the outline regulations on the common fisheries policy were not agreed until eight hours after the Community had opened the accession negotiations with the United Kingdom in 1971 . #% I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work , but I have to respectfully disagree with him with regard to the two amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs which seemed to me , and to many on my committee , to be pushing in exactly the opposite , retrogressive direction to that of this proposal . #% He set out a time frame and turned that vision into reality . #% This whole business contrasts markedly with my request for restrictions to be placed on the use of mobile phones by young children , in a formal question to the Commission under the same precautionary principle . #% However , as Mr Virrankoski said , there has of course been poor implementation of payment appropriations amounting to EUR 82 billion . #% I have been watching this debate ever since the appalling attacks in New York four years ago , and that is what people in the European Union have tried to do at every attempt . #% Thank you very much to Mr Veltroni for giving us such a valuable report . #% Our group , as we stated at first reading , welcome the Commission proposals which we believe will bring about further liberalization in this sector , in particular simplifying the rules applying to international passenger coach and bus services . #% They can all see that if the IGC discards the outcome of the Convention , then it will fall to them to come up with alternative solutions commanding a greater consensus . #% Pension funds in the private sector have been taxed since 1977 , taking over GBP 5.5 billion every year out of ordinary people 's savings , whilst politicians enjoy privileged pensions at the expense of the hard-pressed taxpayer . #% What benefits will there be to us from their access to it ? #% In that respect , we can point to a considerable success for the mechanisms that we have operating within the European Union . #% Thirdly , the IGC should be convened at summit level , preferably before 1 May , to enable a genuine political debate with a European dimension to be held . #% The Commission has met its obligations . #% The contempt with which our pleadings have met leads me to think that most of the rest of you must inhabit a different planet . #% Whilst I have some philosophical sympathy with Senator Hollings and his colleagues who consider that state-owned companies have some hidden and sometimes explicit advantages over their privately-owned competitors , the way in which Congress in the United States is trying to address this issue is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of US multilateral commitments . #% Can I also say a word about Mr Lange 's other proposed Amendment No 48 on sound level measurements . #% However , if Parliament is determined to have its say , we should remember that the sugar regime has existed virtually unchanged for almost 40 years , and yet here we are trying to introduce wholesale change almost overnight . #% Mr President , Uzbekistan , the land of Bukhara and Samarkand is now in our thoughts as the border country of Afghanistan with Taliban-linked extremists operating in its territory . #% However , we can not support the use of EU money in a civil court case in Northern Ireland . #% Many of these people are not regular business flyers or regular flyers like ourselves , and they do not have the financial means to deal with this sort of upheaval . #% Very little money filters down to the ordinary people who are amongst the poorest in the world in one of the poorest regions of the world . #% Therefore , does the Austrian Presidency agree that any realistic common energy policy should include the use of nuclear power ? #% One has to hope that can be changed rapidly . #% There is no hierarchy of oppression . #% Neither could we support the extension of the scope of this regulation to in-flight security , nor the extension on competence of the European Aviation Safety Agency , at least until it has proven its ability to operate its current safety functions in a competent and efficient manner . #% The time is long overdue for the EU to call Mr Bush 's bluff . #% A second conference is scheduled for next month . #% That is why it is important that social safety nets in those Member States are not ignored . #% Mr President , those who claim -- on one side of the House , notably -- that the French and Dutch have said ` no ' and that this whole debate must therefore come to an end and we should never again consider changing the treaties are guilty of being far too simplistic and of only wanting to hear one answer . #% Nevertheless , I believe that the proposal was a flawed gesture from the EU and not the sort of aid we should be intent on sending . #% It is ` yes ' to debate , it is ` yes ' to cooperation , but it is ` no ' to comitology . #% There is virtually no gain for the environment in this scheme . #% Speed and navigational limits could be imposed , and I entirely support their right to do that . #% Nevertheless , to neglect Latin America would be at our peril . #% This Parliament must register its condemnation of the violent intimidation in Colombia or anywhere in the world against trade unionists simply trying to represent their members according to their rights under international law . #% 
We did not want to send the wrong signal against the strong support we wish to demonstrate for the reform process . #% Many of us also recall that Turkey has been a staunch ally in NATO for some 50 years and that during much of that time the country was subject to terrorist attacks by organisations sponsored by the Soviet Union . #% Mr President , you are obviously in a generous mood tonight . #% They do work together , but this is something which could be improved . #% We have suffered in recent months and over the last year from the global economic crisis . #% There are some who have said that the state of emergency is a technical issue , as it were , to ensure that a government can at least continue beyond the caretaker period . #% The challenge is here to achieve a limit which has never been achieved before , and it is within our grasp to do it . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I , like many others in this House , share the concern for , and the sympathy with , the people affected by the terrible floods in Pakistan . #% We already have adequate laws in the United Kingdom , but want to encourage other states to meet our own high standards . #% In Stockholm , it has already been found that costs are higher than anticipated . #% That opportunity must not be wasted . #% This shows the ` Alice in Wonderland ' level the debate has now reached . #% We welcome the feed and food controls in order to ensure healthy animals and good meat for people throughout Europe . #% We need to make sure that we have proper , concrete measures introduced to help the accession countries find their way around more easily than we were able to a few years ago . #% Fragile public confidence in the technical competence and responsible care exercised by the industry is once again evaporating into thin air . #% Colombia is also a promising example of how democracy can truly flourish in Latin America and it is now negotiating an FTA with the EU . #% That is referred from the Milan court . #% When that ban was challenged by the French Food Safety Agency , as they had the right to do , I guess , in terms of their own remit , it was referred to the Scientific Committee , which unanimously endorsed the safety of British beef . #% It is not surprising therefore that following Pol Pot 's death and the defeat of the Khmer Rouge , there should be a need for some kind of national catharsis through the application of justice and a calling to account of those responsible . #% Having a professional security service enables that to happen . #% Now that is how we ensure safety . #% That might be the most appropriate approach to ensuring tight coordination and continuity within the Council . #% I call upon the European Parliament and the European Commission to give funding for education , basic justice and democracy immediately . #% Frankly , if no group - not even Mr Goebbel 's own group - has been persuaded that a debate is worth having , then clearly it can be left to the committee , which also meets in public . #% Now we learn on top of all that the City of Strasbourg may well have been using the decision to exploit its monopoly to defraud the people of Europe . #% I wish , therefore , to offer a personal apology to anyone who is offended , to every Member of this House . #% We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements . #% The EU has made a commitment to reduce burdens on small and medium enterprises by 25 % by 2012 and this law is a vitally important step along the path to achieving this objective . #% But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used . #% Mr President , may I say I welcome Sir Leon 's remarks on the WTO . #% We are going to see further pressures on this industry unless we can try and devise a plan for the future . #% Just because the cooperation currently is not adequate , it does not follow that a single service would have worked better . #% Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring . #% However , we have long argued for proper assessments of whether some legislation is actually required at all . #% But they do bring benefits to millions who would accept that they are a supplement to , but not a substitute for , a balanced diet . #% I made a statement to Congress on behalf of the delegation which was lodged in the Congressional Records and I hope with your permission it can be lodged in our own Parliament records as well . #% As the Spanish representative said , when joining other countries in registering his country 's dissent from the final text , it is the first time that the entrepreneurial sector has been included in any directive . #% We may be a single market but there is not a market in blood : there is a community in blood . #% This is one of the many questions we must ask President Zardari . #% It meets weekly in my office in the Belliard building , or a room booked in my name , and includes the assistants of Members from political groups other than the PSE , such as the PPE and the EDN . #% Mr President , agriculture , support for rural development and the protection of rural communities are at the heart of Mr Khanbhai 's report and he addresses many of the fundamental inequities which feature so prominently in the lives of the rural poor . #% There is therefore a heavy responsibility on us to provide access to justice when things go wrong . #% We have been promised progress in setting up a network of competent national services in Member States . #% Those of us who have had the opportunity to test those systems will understand their efficiency . #% We can not support calls for exporting the EU social model as a condition of opening up world trade . #% This morning I was in the STOA Panel discussing and voting on a study on inedibles in food product packaging . #% Thirdly , we called on the Member States and the Commission to set targets and precise goals to measure the progress towards the goals that had been set , i.e. to set indicators to monitor them . #% Indeed , the Commission itself is already establishing a European quality shipping information system available to the public . #% Broadly , the Council position has struck the right balance on the charging , licensing , access and separation issues . #% So all the more pity that the rapporteur has let her Old Labour instincts loose to run down and attack her country in this way and to spoil this report . #% I hope that the paragraph will be interpreted in a manner appropriate to these situations . #% The fact is that there is little scope for this , even if it was desirable . #% Quite frankly , we can not run the important issue of asylum and immigration on knee-jerk rhetoric that only upsets and fuels the anxieties of our population . #% Six months after the 30 June deadline , a third of Member States have still not submitted their national energy efficiency action plans . #% Over the last few years , that has changed significantly , thanks to pressure from the European Parliament . #% The Treaty requires the Commission to promote social dialogue , not undermine it . #% We have come together on three important issues : firstly , on the issue of cement . #% Nevertheless , we are not entirely reassured while sentences of death by stoning continue to be passed and while the use of the death penalty more generally continues to grow . #% The EU has a heavy responsibility to get the balance right between encouragement , as in the case of visa facilitation which will be debated tonight , and pressure , for example on delivering war crime suspects to The Hague -- particularly as regards the challenge in Kosovo . #% There again we have an atrocious regime , which in many respects is even more abusive to its people than the Burma dictatorship . #% Half the people of that unhappy country live in Algerian refugee camps because of Morocco 's military takeover . #% We can not risk temporary work being used as a way of bypassing normal employment laws rather than , as it should be , a properly regulated means of satisfying employers ' short-term needs . #% There are three main issues in British agriculture which worry us . #% The one aspect of the European Union for which there is any enthusiasm is the single market , but British farmers and businessmen have always suspected that the odds were deliberately stacked against them because certain Member States simply ignored the rules . #% I have a couple of supplementary questions . #% I also welcome -- as I am sure the President-in-Office does -- the strong reference in the document to the need for innovative sources of finance to be sought in order to meet the MDGs . #% 
It is relevant because of the Lisbon process . #% Incidentally , if Parliament is to do a sequel to Troubled Waters , maybe next time it should also feature our Commissioner . #% That discussion and decision will take place in a different House at a different time . #% I wanted to make those explanations . #% The United Nations Convention in 1951 was clear : it should be applied to the letter but not replaced or surrounded with new regulations which , in my view , could cause even more confusion . #% As coordinator for my Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I want to focus on one crucial priority : the internal market . #% On that basis , the current state of affairs is not satisfactory , but nor is what is proposed . #% People are suffering from hunger and health problems as a result of food and medical aid being withheld from areas that are covered by the opposition parties . #% Does federation guarantee peace ? #% What we need and what this report brings us towards is a ban on the marketing of products tested on animals . #% A war on Iraq in these circumstances would be immoral , illegal , dangerous and wrong . #% I would like to touch on foreign policy . #% Institutional reform of Nato is also something we see as imperative . #% Saudi Arabia is also brutal in its decapitations for misdemeanours , like alcohol consumption . #% This is very important because taxpayers ' money is involved here . #% Tackling these disparities must be a priority . #% We know that two billion a day is still being spent on the military and on arms sales - 40 % of it from Europe . #% Mr President , last week at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation , India and Pakistan announced that they will meet again in a month 's time to take bilateral confidence-building measures , including talks on Kashmir . #% If gender is the only equality objective that stays outside the Fundamental Rights Agency , that will create an unbalanced model as well as weakening the latter agency . #% I just want to add one thought , and I say it with great respect to you , Madam President , as something you can take back to the Bureau . #% I would remind colleagues that the existing instruments covering nuclear safety -- national regulations and the Convention on Nuclear Safety -- are perfectly and wholly adequate . #% There was a formal delegation which I chaired from Parliament to the USA in June and there is an understandable confusion when another group of MEPs some three weeks later arrive in the USA , to all intents and purposes also a European Parliament delegation . #% As soon as the information is available the necessary action will be taken . #% That is why I insist that the Commission exercises its responsibility under the Treaty of European Union so that this Stability Pact is not used by those forces in the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers that want to undermine the development of employment within the European Union . #% There is no evidence to support zero tolerance . #% I have to say that the conclusions say nothing of the kind . #% Mr President , I address my remarks this morning in the main to Mrs De Palacio . #% I very much hope that on this , as on so many issues of common concern , we can find a practical and acceptable solution . #% We support many of the aims of this report and , in particular , we approve the sharing of best practice in construction and technology of housing as a way to encourage energy efficiency . #% Why are so many people , at least in my own country , Britain , so frightened of the word constitution ? #% My last point is on labelling . #% The Commission has worked long and hard on this . #% These are substantial powers . #% In the limited speaking time I have , I want to focus on just one aspect and that is the health aspects of flying . #% No exception has been moved for these under Article 2 ( 2 ) and the closure of incinerators following the entry into force of the directive would pose enormous problems of cost and of disposal of animal waste for UK farmers . #% That is the reason why we are very pleased to support this proposal for a directive on the training of cabin crew . #% My group will vote against this report because it disregards that important principle . #% All I can say is that we will redouble our efforts to try to ensure that we support her in overcoming those obstacles and moving the social agenda forward . #% I call for restraint from any action to distort the true will of the people to elect a president of their choosing . #% I hope the Commission will institute urgent proceedings against the French authorities in order to rectify this situation . #% What do we say to future generations ? #% The losses that they are now faced with and that are , seemingly , forcing them into bankruptcy , occurred under the regulatory regime enforced between 1978 and 2001 . #% The Commissioner himself said that the original proposal envisaged a far lighter-touch approach to natural radiation than artificial sources . #% We need to understand - and I want to make a strong case for this - that capacity constraints are an essential part of how we deal with the ability of developing countries to tackle the trade issues that they face at this time , in bilateral , regional , and multilateral negotiations . #% As colleagues know , I am a fervent supporter of information and consultation but an equally fervent opponent of a one-size-fits-all straitjacket for companies of all shapes and sizes . #% But I am happy to say that some agreement has now been reached with Mr Brinkhorst , the Commission staff and Mr Tillich in the meetings we have had on the future of the health and safety unit , and that is now evidenced in the SAB . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade . - Madam President , I should like to really warmly welcome Mrs Svensson 's report and to congratulate her on her excellent work . #% Parliament should be taking steps now to ensure that the final shape of the legislation places firm obligations on Member States to achieve the objectives they claim they want to achieve . #% The treaties are the constitution of the European Union . #% However , on the point in question , I understand that duty-free helps to provide the services for the flying public in this area . #% In the areas of poultry and rabbit production , there is clearly a demonstrable need for that and there is no serious problem of public health . #% I always argued very strongly against that viewpoint in the 60s and 70s and argued that one of the great advantages of British membership of the European Union was precisely that it would bring the Commonwealth countries into a relationship with the rest of Europe , with all the advantages that could bring . #% I gather that some of the detainees have been tortured , although we do not have the precise details . #% Mr President , you are absolutely right that to amend the Rules of Procedure requires an absolute majority of Members of the House . #% In particular the use of animal testing , which is of great concern to many of my constituents , has been changed to incorporate validation of alternatives . #% What is he going to do -- stand in the middle of the street with a tin hat on his head ? #% Mr President , I wanted to identify the website that I had visited this morning just before this debate . #% In one sense I am almost amused that the resolution welcomes its creation nine years on . #% It also highlights the fact that there is considerable evidence that over many years Pakistan has provided Kashmiri militants with training , weapons , funding and sanctuary and has encouraged militants to commit atrocities on the Indian-administered side . #% But just look around this Chamber this morning , Mr Van Rompuy . #% As we know , most of Aceh 's 4.2 million people live outside the two main towns . #% So , I urge all colleagues to reject the amendments put forward by the European People 's Party and their colleagues on the far right . #% How does the report fit in here ? #% Tomorrow I shall be speaking at a conference in Greece on this very subject . #% 30 years of vicious oppression , marked only by a few bloodied milestones of failed invasions abroad and genocidal assaults at home lie in the past . #% This simply can not carry on . #% 
It is practised in the world 's largest democracies such as the USA , Japan and India and is supported by tens of millions of citizens in my country , the UK . #% It would seem , at least to us in my group , to be a shame to jeopardise a compromise which took so long and was frankly so painful in its birth . #% We remain convinced that that needs to be the case , and I very much hope therefore that the proposal to reject the Commission 's proposal will be agreed in the vote tomorrow , just as it was in plenary last spring and in the Employment Committee this March . #% I need clarification on three things for our committee meeting tomorrow . #% A number of European citizens have petitioned this Parliament about problems with Lloyds of London . #% We can not allow the pilots who are trying to protect humanity to be themselves endangered . #% Parliament has consistently taken the position that no assistance from the EU should go to Zimbabwe other than through NGOs ; it should not be in any way in the hands of government . #% Britain 's own traitorous Labour Government has reneged on its promise to give the British people a referendum on Lisbon and the one person who could hold out the hope of a referendum , David Cameron , does not have the courage , principle or inclination to do so . #% I do not know whether Mr Juncker was being naive or arrogant , but last week he counted the cost of it . #% In this way all perpetrators may be tried by such international panel tribunals which may have jurisdiction with respect to those contracting parties which have accepted its jurisdiction . #% The research which has been done , most of which I am afraid is not within the EU , shows that , if you give children support and what they need when they are young , it helps them in later life : it cuts down on crime , improves health and cuts down on unemployment , therefore benefiting all of us . #% So Commissioner , can you really justify this position ? #% Those are the alternatives which confront us . #% May I just thank the Presidency for its answer and urge it to persevere . #% Indeed we believe it should go beyond the physical limits of the Union since the Net is no respecter of national boundaries . #% Today 's discussions have been entertaining and humorous in many respects . #% I will tell you why ; because there has been a lack of co-ordinated and consistent international approach for fear of offending Mr Putin and allies . #% I ask myself , having listened quite carefully to the Commissioner , whether there is any new information in the statement that he has made . #% This very week a major conference in the United States is expressing fears about the inability of developed and developing societies alike to combat and prevent the resurgence of diseases thought to be beaten . #% The Commission may have some argument , but I would remind the Commissioner of the Zwartveld judgement . #% The other institutions , as Mme Ber√®s has said , have shown not one gram of loyal cooperation but instead have gone out of their way to subvert the very clear Employment Committee recommendation to the plenary : the rejection of the Commission 's proposal . #% The conclusions of this report , as the rapporteur has already mentioned , echo a recently published report from the House of Lords in my own country . #% The problem is that sometimes these judgments are marginal . #% I think that some of the contributions today show that those people who have spoken simply do not understand the process that we have undergone since 1990 when stage one of EMU began . #% There is some passing reference to these matters in the motion for a resolution which contains many useful elements . #% The proposals before us move completely in the wrong direction . #% I pay particular tribute to the Commissioner himself and to his team . #% I would add that Mr Cunha is an esteemed Member of this House ; he is also a personal friend . #% Mr President , as we debate , yet again , this issue of the regulation of Lloyd 's of London , 63 names are currently facing bankruptcy proceedings against them in the English courts . #% However , I reject the notion that this should be done , by the EU on behalf of any one , let alone sovereign Nation States . #% We also support many of the detailed proposals for improving transparency and the rights of stakeholders . #% To this end , the President of the Commission this morning promised Parliament that he would publish the note to Commissioner Kinnock from Mr Jules Muis of the Internal Audit Service . #% I should like to ask you to send a further letter , with much more ferocity , saying that what we look for as Members are short answers , not long rambling speeches . #% The commitment to openness and transparency is , as the President-in-Office mentioned earlier in his speech , an idea whose time has come . #% However , there are a number of elements in the resolution with which many of us disagree , such as : the redefinition of human rights ( paragraphs 50 , 51 and 72 ) ; the unbalanced condemnations of Turkey ( paragraphs 88 and 89 ) ; the misunderstanding of the nature and status of caste in India ( paragraph 106 etc. ) ; the call for legally-binding criteria for arms exports ( paragraph 113 ) . #% Finally , I know that you will work with us to adopt , as quickly as possible , the general framework on information and consultation and the company statute . #% The other issue I want to deal with very briefly is the way in which your presidency will deal with the Essen conclusions and the whole approach to employment . #% Do we have similar estimates from other countries ? #% Bearing in mind the nature of the report , we ought to have it in English . #% Mr President , can I first of all make an observation on behalf of many Members about the gross discourtesy of the Commission in not being present for this debate . #% I welcome that call . #% However , the new Constitution contains a reference to our religious heritage and other heritages , and its values are Christian values and also the values of many others . #% Both I , as rapporteur , and the chairman of the Committee on Petitions have been in regular contact with the Greek authorities to try and resolve these issues and the cases that are currently before them . #% There are still major areas of poverty . #% The rapporteur has steered this debate impeccably through the difficulties that we often encounter with these comparatively small arguments . #% However we face a stark challenge . #% That said , on the issue of maximising the effectiveness of the decision-making process in this field , we underline that , on this issue , it is solely for Member States in the Council to decide . #% I would like to give you a final thought , when we are considering relative risk : that accidents like this put the relative safety of nuclear energy into a different perspective . #% The most useful European Union contribution in a situation such as East Timor is more likely to be civil rather than military . #% The reason why they have not been observed , is that the abuses are carried out by armed groups , especially the political security branch of the security forces , which is responsible only to the President . #% I believe that will be the way forward for a lot of agriculture in the future . #% A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda . #% We clearly need more urgency in this area and we need a single , coherent framework within which the defence industry can cooperate . #% That is the most crucial message that we must all remember . #% I also welcome China and Russia 's belated support . #% On numerous occasions , it was EU reluctance to improve access for South African agricultural goods which nearly blocked the whole deal and to follow this up with yet another dishonourable act would be extremely unfortunate . #% What exactly has he achieved ? #% We warned the British Labour Government months ago about the dangers of an open-ended commitment of British troops to Sierra Leone . #% I am sure that every one of us in this Chamber wants an end to the bloodshed and that we want a peaceful settlement in Sri Lanka . #% . It was with some regret that I voted against this outcome of a conciliation procedure . #% Meetings of all the chairmen of the foreign affairs committees , or all the chairmen of the trade committees relating to the World Trade Organisation , or all the chairmen of environment committees relating directly to the World Environment Organisation or to UNEP could be creative . #% Mr President , we face many myths and red herrings as we try to promote the debate on the EU Constitution . #% The first draft sought - absurdly - to outlaw political party campaigning with public money . #% It must also be made quite clear that Members themselves must hold a certain amount of responsibility for making sure they check that their names are recorded . #% We have to be actively involved in order to improve the implementation of the European strategy . #% We must never again see the mass slaughter of ten million animals - our citizens will not accept it . #% 
The Union has therefore raised with the Chinese Government the cases of Xu Wenli and others who have been trying to exercise basic rights that are specified by the United Nation 's Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , which was actually signed by China in October 1998 . #% We will continue to push EU governments to take more detainees for resettlement , both out of transatlantic solidarity and out of guilt at their own complicity , and we will resist Chinese threats regarding the Uighurs . #% Millions of healthy animals were needlessly slaughtered in an orgy of killing and burning that shocked the world . #% UN sanctions against Iran will only gain real legitimacy in the region if Israel is made to turn around its defiance of Security Council resolutions , a defiance unmatched by any other nation . #% The information which will be provided , which was a vade mecum in this report , to small businesses and which they now have a right to be informed about , will go a long way in helping to change the culture in the workplace . #% It is right and appropriate to show that we are responsible and accountable . #% On the other proposal which the Council has been asking for , namely the audits of our general office allowances , there is no reason why on 20 July , if we do not have an agreement on the Members ' Statute we should not say there will be an annual audit of the general office allowance which must be submitted to Parliament , carried out by bona fide auditors and must be submitted to Parliament for Members to receive their annual allowance . #% Let us hope and believe that in this year 2000 , Turkey 's commitment to our millennium year globally will be the abolition of the death penalty once and for all through the democratic parliamentary process . #% You said : ' the agenda is a matter for the Conference of Presidents . ' #% I know that some want to delete it , but it seems to me that given that the new ` good ' and ` excellent ' standards are much tougher , and that even with investment some beaches may fail , especially after rain , we need the ` sufficient ' category as a sort of probationary category . #% We need to know from which state a product has arrived . #% Mr President , this proposed set of amendments to our Rules of Procedure that has been so ably drafted by our rapporteur is intended to resolve a contradiction . #% We need to de-link issues . #% This House will welcome the announcement that the EU-inspired African Union , still in its infancy since being founded in 2002 , will shortly have its first Pan-African Parliament meeting in Addis Ababa and plans somewhat ambitiously to set up a security council with a standing army to prevent future conflicts on that continent . #% It needs to bed down , and we want to see budget neutrality and more political accountability . #% Mr President , I met both Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat in the Middle East last summer . #% Europe has to negotiate from a position of strength in this global regime . #% The VPAs ( Voluntary Partnership Agreements ) are good for the planet , good for our partner countries and good for the EU . #% In my opinion she has been a model comrade and a model colleague , diligent , direct , dedicated . #% Now they are coming back to translate that into our Rules of Procedure to ensure that our work is transparent . #% Only last week , for example , the government passed a law stating that women would not be allowed to perform music on the radio . #% In a way , they have been the poor relation in these debates because of the immense complexity of the situation with regard to human medicinal substances . #% Obviously following from that , we do not consider that it is sensible or necessary to make what would be a false distinction between urgent and less-urgent aspects of reform . #% The Council deleted the reference to an efficient coordination between the different actors concerned and between countries as essential to ensure the coherence of these policies . #% Mr President , I am grateful to the honourable lady . #% In a number of places , there are implied criticisms of close allies whereas our criticisms should be aimed at those that are a threat to international security . #% This is a codecision dossier . #% Stand up and fight for democracy once again . #% The working group 's proposals , of course , were wide-ranging : only a few of them require adjustment to our Rules , but this is one of them . #% Other Member States use derogations because they have collective agreements . #% Mr President , Parliament can point to some real gains from the deal negotiated with the Council to fast-track this legislation and avoid the conciliation procedure . #% On time , in keeping with the promises we made on 1 March 2000 we have set out the most complex and extensive set of proposed reforms for personnel management and conduct in the European Commission and European public service comparable to the work that has been undertaken in the administrations of Member States over five and ten years . #% The fact that you can actually have rules for Bucharest , London and Paris and consumers in those places is absolutely ludicrous . #% The success of that mission will drag both Islam and Christianity far away from the terrible certainties of the 14th century . #% Madam President , in this week 's European Voice , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is quoted as ` urging Germans to work harder , finish their education earlier and retire later ' . #% When it comes to the votes later on today , I would particularly like to ask Members to support the rapporteur 's amendment which seeks to include the option of including emission trading schemes in the EU and IMO rules . #% The carcinogenic effects of hard wood , as we have just heard , have been of the greatest concern to the European Union 's Member States . #% Campaigners for this so-called Robin Hood tax , including Labour MEPs , now need to expand on their success and continue to put pressure on the global financial sector to expand this scheme to create a worldwide Financial Transaction Tax . #% Nevertheless , there is also an EU-Palestine Free Trade Agreement . #% In this House I am sure we welcome all the new Member States into the European Union . #% This need is highlighted by the success of this week 's common mission to Iran , and is underlined by the desperate need for Europe to maintain pressure through the quartet dealing with the Middle East Peace Process . #% By 2011 , Member States are expected to start consolidation to bring their public deficits within the 3 % limit within two years . #% Where they propose action , they are often vague , and there is virtually no indication of resources or the timing of the strategy 's implementation . #% The one thing that we can be sure of is that there is fat chance that this EU directive will be accepted , as it will derail the EU rail network . #% That will stand this measure in good stead . #% Is the intention to give an enlarging group of European nations a stronger voice on the world stage and improve the coordination and effectiveness of their policies on a range of issues ? #% We all know that what is in the back of our minds , and what we fear , is that Albania will turn into another Bosnia , and if that happens the whole of the Balkans will explode . #% Mr President , before the House today is a resolution on Burma , drafted with the support of all major political groups in this Parliament and therefore backed by representatives of all fifteen countries within the European Union . #% Would it not be handy to have powers to cut that short and make it even sharper ? #% As you can see : at the fifty-fifth minute of this Question Time we are on Question 5 and the honourable Member has asked five distinct questions in his question . #% I would like to address the three key questions that I tried to answer in my report : Why is this so important ? #% Nevertheless , even those of us opposed in principle to a constitution , with a foreign minister , permanent president and binding charter of fundamental rights , accept there is a need for treaty adjustment in order to accommodate future enlargement beyond the Nice formula and to settle the increasing imbalance between small and large Member States in terms of voting rights in the institutions . #% Let me say what an enormous relief it is to have a few minutes of not debating REACH in endless groups around this Parliament -- a few minutes only , I fear . #% Dioxin , and in this case its source chemical PCB , is one of the number of non-biodegradable bio-accumulative chemicals that we know are contaminating the food chain around the world . #% I do not think it is a particular problem for new plants to comply with these regulations though I recognise that there are problems for some of the older plants . #% It needs only one political group to request a debate for that debate to take place . #% At the Egyptian elections , which we witnessed last year , we saw intimidation of voters , including those supporting Dr Ayman Nour , leader of the secular al-Ghad Party . #% Should this happen , will Member States coordinate at EU level in future ? #% What we are very concerned about in this House is the accountability of the European Central Bank , the role after the establishment of the EMU of that Central Bank and indeed of the euro in general . #% We should have some sort of umbrella which links and coordinates them . #% If we continue that process the world will become much more secure because every issue and every crisis will be divisive as we try to gather around separate poles . #% The proposals put forward for a settlement on the basis of the United Nations Security Council resolutions including a United Nations peacekeeping force with Russians should be wholeheartedly supported . #% Vaccination would not have worked in the UK situation . #% There needs to be tough action again on these flags of convenience . #% The directive also places huge new costs and administrative burdens on industry in terms of measuring vibration levels and recording exposure . #% It is not true to say that the banks are operating a price ring and deliberately keeping the prices high because with globalisation there are fewer and fewer banks , which means less and less competition . #% 
This directive will do much to ensure that the single market is not distorted by asymmetric tax regimes and it will create a situation whereby , after a transition period of three years , Member States will exchange information on savings income received by non-residents . #% All this is well presented in the report . #% As Mr Bradbourn has reiterated on many occasions during the formulation of this programme , it must strike a balance , and he firmly believes this common position would do just that . #% This calendar has been introduced without any such debate . #% The Troika often works to promote human rights in an intergovernmental framework . #% The Council meeting could have made clear its determination to fight the protectionist threat to Europe 's prosperity and the functioning of the single market . #% Therefore , we would like those amendments available to us before we come to final decisions on the financial perspective next year . #% We must understand that there are three stages of legislation - formulation , implementation , including transposition , and enforcement - and we have to see the process as a whole . #% The listing of antibiotics and stimulants that might have been administered would , if adopted , create a two-tier beef market . #% But the issue we are debating today is the murder of Robert McCartney , and we need to keep that issue in the public eye . #% Madam President , Commissioner Patten correctly said that we have no quarrel with Islam . #% I could tell you of the vast advantages of EMU but we should recognize some of the problems : fraud practised , say , on older citizens who will be unfamiliar with the euro when it comes into effect . #% If so , with what justification ? #% I wonder whether you will also join me in congratulating our colleague , Dana Rosemary Scallon , on the marvellous role that she played in Ireland in helping to deliver a no vote in the referendum . #% I commend the proposal to the House . #% Madam President , I would like to explain the votes on behalf of the ELDR Group . #% I very much hope that the Commission will be able to make some comment about that . #% The issue is how restructuring should be managed and who should do the managing . #% Interest groups in favour of bio-diesel development should lobby the national government , not Brussels . #% There are reasons for this , but these come into play when we look at future spending patterns . #% I am sure when we come to the vote you will see how impossible that position has proved to be . #% We need a new way , recognizing that in a fast-moving world of constant innovation and technological change , governments can help to equip people to cope with inevitable change . #% Equally , we must remember that we need to be sensible . #% Madam President-in-Office , you have said that this should be something which should be done but in my own country our Prime Minister , Mr Blair , has been curiously silent on this subject . #% The other day when he spoke to the Agriculture Committee I felt very much that he will be a strong leader in his mid-term review and will carry the reforms through . #% The Commissioner mentioned the disease and I would like to ask him another question . #% As the Commissioner said , the electoral roll must not just be above scrutiny , it must be so that people do not feel that they have been left out . #% Mr President , it is with both sadness and frustration that I find myself presenting yet another resolution on Zimbabwe - the sixth within a year . #% It is still a long , slow struggle but progress is under way . #% Of course , in those days it was thought that all the referenda would be won . #% Now there is political , uncivil insecurity for you ! #% Would the Member States -- the Council -- be prepared to consider giving additional money to cover the costs of the OCTs ? #% To take such action would neuter this Parliament . #% These moves will enhance European citizens ' rights vis-√†-vis big banking corporations . #% That is the purpose of the report , and I hope it is now clear . #% In addition , they will invest and expand in the industry because low inflation will breed lower costs of money . #% Similarly , the committee did not support the Liberal position that it would be useful to publish the ECB ' s econometric models of the euro area , partly for fear that they may be abused . #% So , colleagues , let us take an interest again . #% In return for concrete progress , Russia and countries of the Western NIS and the Southern Mediterranean should be offered the prospect of a stake in the EU 's internal market and participation in the so-called four freedoms - in effect , everything bar participation in the Institutions . #% I remind the Commissioner that , despite her comments this afternoon , Parliament is still looking for her support to retain a separate legal base on the European initiative for democracy and human rights . #% . Mr President , I should like to recommend to the House that we split this vote in two and , in respect of the wishes of the House , that we delete the first half of the paragraph and then vote on the second half . #% Mr President , the news that we are seeing at the moment alleging misconduct by the Russian Central Bank comes as very little surprise to many of us . #% In both reports , however , there is still cause for concern and alarm . #% It was disappointing that the summit declaration did not make any reference to parliamentary engagement at all . #% Here I call for a prosecution of Saddam Hussein and his officials under the 1948 Genocide Convention . #% We heard these allegations from my constituent Moazzam Begg , who was released last year , and we have heard them in successive reports . #% Russia also has an important diplomatic role , not only as a permanent member of the UN Security Council but as a major influence on Iran . #% We must be prepared to follow through with that threat if everything else fails . #% It was possible to get some further money as 1 % was levied off all the subsidies for use by the Community fund for tobacco research and information ; and I would hope to apply that to good advantage . #% I am the joint leader of the only Group in this Parliament that has actively been campaigning for ` no ' votes in the Constitutional referendums . #% Indeed , it is the position of one of the largest component parties of the EPP that there should not be an extension of qualified majority voting . #% At a recent meeting I attended in Geneva on the issue of human rights in North Korea , in the presence of the special rapporteur for North Korea , we were told we must have a new resolution next month because there was no dialogue , something we lost with the initial resolution . #% The failure of the LTTE to agree to a second round of Geneva negotiations and its resumption of a terrorist campaign have removed this hope . #% I believe that the Security Council - particularly with the Russian and Chinese veto at stake - may not sanction this issue of a no-fly zone . #% For the above reasons , I voted against this resolution . #% President Barroso has perhaps mentioned one or two of them , but we need to make sure that they flow through in the next mandate , because they are all essential parts of the internal market . #% The vessels up to 12 metres long , which is what we are referring to , are quite large vessels and capable of catching a lot of fish . #% Mr President , I associate myself with everything Mr de Roo has said , and his outrage at these events is shared by many in the United Kingdom , which is the principal destination for these adulterated products . #% I shall conclude with a comment on employment . #% We must have things sorted out by then . #% We have moved substantially in that direction . #% Barbara Weiler says quite clearly and , in my opinion , quite correctly , that we can not afford not to maintain that system and that we should not even want to . #% Indeed , the work we have done has already gained and secured widespread support . #% I agree with the points Mrs Lalumi√®re has made on the current unsuitability of the nature of the partnership and cooperation agreements to be signed by these countries . #% If this is true , it is not a statistic of which any country can be proud . #% The aim is to establish an autonomous European Union military capability to underpin a distinctive EU foreign policy in which the Americans are not involved - in due course , a European army . #% 
That is because we would actually be damaging our ability to support a broad range of socially useful services if we insisted that the delivery mechanism for providing those services remained exactly the same , frozen in time at the very period when all other uses of spectrum are evolving very rapidly . #% I totally agree with the rapporteur that the European Union should offer compensation for those that go out of the industry , and for retraining and re-equipping vessels for different methods of fishing for those that want to carry on . #% It is , of course , ironic , as we mentioned in the Development Committee yesterday , that the Budget Committee voted last week to cut the budget line on reproductive health care and HIV/AIDS work by half from EUR 25 million to 12 million , and that we are now discussing the need for investment in this area . #% The Commission and the European Union could play a significant part in ensuring that the rise of this disease is matched only by the information about how to treat it and how to avoid it in the first place ? #% Please do not let Europe 's consumers down with undue delay in view of what you may have heard today . #% Extraordinarily , it is suggested that WTO members should remove their non-tariff barriers since they apparently hamper market access . #% Unless there is a change , the Indonesian authorities must understand that their total disregard of international standards on human rights will have an impact on economic and political relations between Europe and the Indonesian Government , and the Council and the Commission should give careful consideration to what action can be taken on this forthwith . #% Your people deserve better than that . #% Mr President , I know I have one minute , and you would not let me go over it , would you ? #% I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House . #% At the very least , therefore , this Parliament should pause for thought and refer this legislation back to a committee for a full evaluation of its costs and consequences . #% I know that he shares our deep concern about implementation of legislation by Member States and making sure that it happens effectively so that the internal market , of which we are all so proud , works properly . #% However , I would say to our colleagues on the Bodensee that , if there is a problem in this particular stretch of water , then , firstly , there is no evidence that it is caused by recreational craft and , secondly , that if there is a difficulty it can be solved by local measures in the area of Lake Constance . #% One new element which I welcome very much is the renewed emphasis on the need to ensure that waste management strategy assists and is built around the principle of sustainable development . #% At my meeting with the ECB , I was told that it had solved its problems especially relating to the bonus and this would not happen again and it would send a letter to the Committee detailing its current bonus policy . #% It is vital for the self-employed to be included in any health and safety and employment legislation that emanates from the Commission and this House . #% At the beginning of this year , someone asked me whether there were any problems ahead for the 2004 budget . #% In particular , in relation to monetary policy , we made the point earlier in the debate on economic and monetary union , that under Article 105 of the Treaty when price stability is guaranteed then the monetary authority can address the wider objectives of the European Union . #% I had the honour to lead Parliament 's delegation to the Buenos Aires Conference and the report from myself and other colleagues is available to Parliament . #% But I rise on a different point of order , to ask if you can tell us what has happened to the German presidency . #% The rule would also allow the parties to agree , if they so wish , on more precise arrangements for their cooperation , which opens the door to possibilities such as a joint working group . #% The Bureau has to come and justify before this Parliament the decisions it has taken as they are not in line with our resolutions . #% I suggest that if that proposal is being made seriously , it would be laughed out of court across Europe . #% I would ask you to respond to Parliament 's demands on this matter . #% Everyone must heed what the United Nations says . #% There is only one way to reassure public opinion and maintain the vital goal of EU enlargement . #% It is simply unacceptable that as many as 42,000 people are killed and over 1.7 million injured on roads across the European Union every year . #% In his answer he has given no evidence whatsoever that he is aware of those facts . #% The only way forward is through negotiations . #% We have a situation within the United Kingdom - and , for that matter , Europe - over fibreglass , which has an import duty at the moment of ( and I stand to be corrected on this ) 43.6 % . #% In 1948 , when Sri Lanka obtained independence , it was one of the most prosperous countries in South Asia . #% I understand very well why the rapporteur is proposing slightly later dates than the Commission . #% I shall be raising this with MEP colleagues and may wish to ask you to intervene at an appropriate time . #% We asked for controlled and gradual liberalisation . #% With help from this Parliament , Bangladesh can share in that sense of belonging , in the wealth , the prosperity and ultimately the success that will bring . #% They are also concerned about the level of commitment to development cooperation which they might expect from the new countries coming into the Union . #% Finally , on International Women 's Day , I must pay tribute to motherhood . #% Every one of us would want to welcome the small indication of progress that comes after the meetings with Secretary of State Slater and Ambassador Morningstar . #% The positive steps taken for third country nationals -- Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's report -- are also there and were in the original Commission proposal . #% This is an important venture which we must all support . #% Mr President , I congratulate the Commission and the team led in the Commissioner 's office by Mr Fotiadis and those on the ground for the amazing work they are carrying out . #% We welcome the recognition of the need for a single procedure in all Member States and find it very interesting that we are talking about reviewing the role of the Court of Justice this week . #% Also , we are only getting the German interpretation in our offices . #% This IGC , though , will not be so much about broadening the field of responsibility or the competences of the European Union ; it will be about structural reform , institutional reform , reform that will make the Union more open , more efficient , more democratic and more transparent . #% A new law on the creation of opposition parties requires 50 000 citizens ' signatures before they can be registered . #% I welcome the presence of the Royal Family of Laos , who are here in the distinguished visitors ' gallery today . #% May I just say how appalled I was at the view expressed by Mr Watson , the Liberal leader , that terrorists have the same human rights as their victims . #% I understand the reasons why and would have accepted them had he at least informed us . #% We are not talking about ministers but of a civil servant from the representation of the government holding the presidency at that particular time . #% Over the months and years that followed , the Thule workers began to suffer all sorts of terrible health consequences . #% Finland has a lot to teach us , particularly in relation to the importance of investment in high-quality education and also how to balance economic efficiency and social justice . #% That is not an acceptable solution for fishermen and for the people who are dependent upon them . #% That foundation is clearly the single market . #% To conclude , I want to talk about the International Criminal Court . #% Whatever they say about having had to vote for the report as a whole at the end in the committee , it does not persuade me that some committee members did not also have concerns about the effects of some of those amendments . #% I joined my fellow Conservatives in voting against this report . #% We have 12 000 new notified addicts , 70 000 drug offences and 1 200 drug related deaths per year . #% Mr President , I welcome the statement . #% What utter humbug ! #% Mr Hoon has even said that there is no concept of a European rapid reaction force as such . #% I remain sceptical about neighbouring countries ' concerns about military intervention , as some fear democracy in Iraq and others giving the Kurds autonomy in the north . #% I would ask that in Amendment No 13 - and I have discussed this with the rapporteur and he agrees with me - the English text should read `` without delay '' and not `` immediately '' . #% It has kidnapped innocent Japanese civilians , most of whom have died in mysterious circumstances . #% Introduction of the necessary changes in an efficient and cost-effective way needs a little more time . #% Could you share with us the progress you have made or expect to make , or the timing thereof ? #% I am also quite sure that the Bureau and the chairs of committee and everybody else will want to be as financially responsible as possible when we are trying to meet Maastricht convergence criteria . #% 
The European Parliament has no powers in this area and should not pretend to , but our handling of this issue has been improved by the appointment and work of Mary Banotti who has a serious and realistic approach . #% It is important to emphasise that . #% It was due , in part , to the lack of numbers on my own side that these amendments went through in committee , so I apologise for that . #% Therefore we , in the ELDR Group , will not be supporting the Lehne amendments because we are extremely keen not to weaken the rules . #% So , why do I speak ? #% I am very curious to know what your views are on the preservation of those clauses as the talks proceed . #% If one looks at the monitoring reports issued recently by the Commission , there are only about two or three paragraphs on the telecoms sector in many of these countries . #% Russia continues to be a democracy , albeit an imperfect one . #% The Commission must continue to support our view that without aid and trade preferences to provide the social safety nets there will be never any possibility of delivering equitable growth to the poorest countries . #% Madam President , globalisation is here to stay and it is here to bring benefits . #% The EAS is a direct product of the Treaty of Lisbon , a treaty I do not approve of and one which has no democratic legitimacy . #% I am afraid , therefore , that the British Conservatives will not be able to support this report . #% Mrs Schroedter said that it would protect against liberalisation . #% At his Berlin Summit meeting at the weekend , Mr Blair seemed sensibly to accept the Convention 's proposals for structured cooperation within and outside Nato , allowing a core group of capable Member States to forge forward to build a common European security and defence policy , not as a last resort but as a first call . #% They can not possibly suffer with Parkinson 's Disease or any other disability . ' #% We can support the broad thrust of Mr Maaten 's report . #% I support the proposal to introduce lower stocking densities for broiler chickens and I will vote for the amendments I have co-signed for still lower levels . #% What we are all agreed upon is that the budget procedure needs to be simplified . #% Moreover , there must be safeguards to ensure that we do not encourage the use of marriage as an avenue to gain illegal entry . #% To relegate sporting activities is to deny the host of benefits that sport brings ; it is something at which all people can succeed , regardless of class and race . #% However , we do perhaps regret the lack of integration with other initiatives that she is pursuing , which is apparent if one reads her communication . #% I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their hard work on the amendments on the prospectus directive . #% This is a significant achievement for this Parliament in influencing the final shape of this legislation . #% I certainly intend to be there myself . #% If I were Greek or Irish , where the GDP of my country would be affected by Amendment No 141 which refers to the co-financing of agriculture , I would not want to vote for that amendmen . #% Why does the Commission insist on the word ` possibly ' ? #% If the effect of the 19 % is passed directly on to the consumer , will the 19 % be calculated on the EUR 180 or on the EUR 10 that it costs to bring them in ? #% The remaining part of the report of the committee can be taken - that only requires a simple majority - to annex the Interinstitutional Agreement to the Rules of Procedure . #% Mr President , my group strongly supports the report by Mr Evans and welcomes its call for a high-quality common asylum policy . #% However , we need to deal with the fraudsters who spread so much misery . #% Romania and Bulgaria will join on 1 January next year for political reasons . #% So we need to ensure that there is political control there , unless of course there are strong political or consumer pressures to ensure that industry makes progress . #% It condemns , in the strongest terms , violence perpetrated by any ethnic group and calls for maximum efforts to secure the reconciliation and cooperation which are essential to stability and security for all in the region . #% The solution to all of this is to ensure that sufficient funds are given to meet the demands and to avoid lengthy delays on the waiting lists . #% It seems to me that both the Commission proposal and the Council proposal have certain short - and medium-term disadvantages . #% The last resolution of this Parliament on Burma was very clear . #% I asked the Commission to give me more details about the establishment , the organisation , and the responsibilities and particularly the role of the assistant . #% The car service is often abused and we have to make sure that it is very carefully controlled indeed . #% No doubt the Chinese will again say this is an internal matter for China , but the international community can not sit idly by when peace-loving people are subjected to this kind of treatment . #% Peasant farmers find it increasingly difficult to produce other crops competitively for export under prevailing conditions of structural adjustment . #% So rather than us just forcibly saying ` the directive is the directive is the directive , thou shalt implement it without delay ' , please can we look at listening a little bit more , because I am sure there is something we can learn . #% I salute Prime Minister Howard of Australia 's robust and courageous stance over this issue . #% The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative , but Europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning . #% There is some degree of concern at some of the initial moves the Commission is now making in its information structures which we in Parliament will keep a close eye on . #% Parliament 's joint motion for a resolution expresses revulsion and repudiation of the Kingdom 's values . #% The additional intervention measures which have been taken are helpful , and the funding of research is crucial . #% Soft law is a worry . #% These citizens appealed to the European Parliament and I am delighted to say that as a result of that petition , the winter fuel allowance is now to be paid to British pensioners wherever they live . #% There is distrust of scientific advisers in this area . #% Pressure needs to be put on their governments to translate the rhetoric into action , to achieve progress on fighting crime and terrorism and upholding human rights . #% When references were being made earlier on to hostility on the part of people in the United States towards the European Union , I did not expect to hear quite so much hostility to the United States on behalf of Members of the European Parliament , particularly from Mr Antony who sits behind me and Mrs Ainardi who sits opposite me . #% Thus its objective is that immigrants or refugees who have been legally resident for at least five years should be given EU long-term residence status . #% However , the UN can only do so much in such a complex and difficult political situation . #% Proper legislation frees and liberates ; bad law cabins , cribs and confines . #% Certainly I would wish to explain why despite our reservations about the resolution and its ambiguous character the Liberal Group in the end decided to support it . #% Thank you Commissioner for a very full answer . #% The package proposed by the Legal Affairs committee represents an important step forward in achieving a fair and open system . #% in writing . - The ECR Group are the strongest supporters of measures against terrorists in the EU and especially believe that national governments within the European Union must work together to tackle the constant threat from terrorism . #% Resolution after resolution has been passed . #% But , as he knows , there was a compromise with the PSE Group that stated ` as yet neither necessary nor desirable and practicable to harmonise fully ' . #% Have you considered how we might reach out to citizens with a communication strategy to make sure that they understand the situation -- not the arcane details , but that they understand , for instance , that Member States have not implemented the anti-terrorism laws ? #% Some have suggested having national referendums all on the same day . #% I will vote against this report , mainly because I believe ITER to be an example of ` Big Science ' that wastes money that would be best put to other R [ amp ] D projects that would do far more for EU competitivity and energy self-sufficiency than this enormous ` boondoggle ' . #% We also need funding via the annual bidding process for the special needs of certain Natura 2000 sites , possibly through the establishment of a biodiversity programme within the LIFE + Programme . #% In order for that to happen , the establishment of security , effective policing and the rule of law should be given absolute priority . #% I address this to President Santer and to the Irish Prime Minister . #% 
I hope that the constructive and cooperative attitude to reform that has repeatedly been manifested by this House will continue strongly and consistently . #% The rapporteur has made clear that there is a difference between her view and that of the Socialists on the issue of organisations for and of disabled people . #% An amendment has been tabled and I urge Members to vote - perhaps against their own groups - for Parliament to have control of the political party funding budget . #% Unfortunately , there is evidence that large numbers of asylum-seekers have been waved through Continental Europe with a suggestion that they head towards our Channel ports in the knowledge that we have a permissive policy with instant rights to housing and social security benefits . #% It is tendentious and ill-informed . #% This would , however , be of minor importance and the resulting rights would be limited . #% The easiest thing here would be to attack the government of one of the Member States . #% In a report last month on the functioning of terrorist legislation in the UK , Lord Carlisle said that in some ports there was effectively no security regarding incomers . #% It is our concern . #% As a politician , the Commissioner knows very well the importance of making sure that that information is presented in a way which is easily digestible and understood by every journalist across the European Union and perhaps a few politicians as well . #% Mr President , I welcome the Lisbon conclusions . #% I am glad that the EU has been the biggest donor to North Korea in recent times . #% We in the European Union have to look at ways to compensate those countries that are being so drained of the skills that they need . #% The FSC dispute provides us with the best means by which to inflict the domestic pressure which is absolutely necessary in order to get some change in the American attitude and to reassert the international rule of law , rather than the rule of the law of George Bush 's economic jungle . #% I urge the President-in-Office to take up that offer . #% What fairminded person could think that the Commission should police itself in this regard ? #% But our humanitarian concern must extend to each and every individual refugee as long as their safety is threatened , wherever they may be . #% Of course we want to see the Europeans reforming and enhancing their military capabilities but I fail to see how the continued reductions that we are seeing in European defence budgets , most notably by Germany , demonstrate resolve to make a greater contribution to Western defence efforts . #% We should be encouraging that dialogue , in order to establish greater freedom of the press in Algeria so that we can all become aware of what is happening . #% I want to remind colleagues that three years ago one of GM 's major plants in the United Kingdom was closed . #% Regarding exchange of information , the guiding norm adopted in the Hague Programme is the principle of availability . #% The figures on late payment which Mr Harrison gives in his report pale into insignificance compared with debt payments in Staffordshire which take much longer and which are driving small businesses into the ground . #% As George Robertson has said , being ready for battle is like pregnancy : you either are or you are not ! #% Both countries have recently announced a ceasefire along the line of control in Kashmir , restored airline and bus links and signed a trade agreement . #% I hope that Parliament will vote to support alternative , climate-friendly technologies and take the big opportunity that stands in front of us to do something serious about the environment , rather than letting the single market ride roughshod over these very important concerns . #% Surely there is a certain irony in calling for compulsory and irrevocable solidarity : surely solidarity is something that is offered and not compulsory . #% If we remember the days of Jacques Delors , your predecessor , he had a clear programme , a vision : the 1992 single market . #% I have been privileged to participate in a number of the high-level working meetings . #% The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign . #% It was an undoubted success of the Uruguay Round , but there are problems associated with it . #% Under the Commission 's proposal there was a very complex quota system which looked as if it should start in 2009 . #% We have some fences we need to mend and we need to try to re-establish confidence in what it is that we want to establish in the Arctic . #% Of course NATO should be and is our first port of call when security is threatened . #% The Indo-Fijians , the Indian population of Fiji , are in considerable danger . #% However , in this case I want to say that there are many cases which reveal gross incompetence over many years which was rife in DG VI ( Administration ) . #% I think it is something the Chinese Government will really take notice of , because I believe bear farming in China must be brought to an end . #% It is one that I have been aware of since I was the rapporteur on the interim agreement . #% What are these circumstances ? #% There are , however , some areas in which we continue to have doubts . #% While national governments are still briefing their civil servants , we can not have a common foreign security policy . #% That has led to confusion and a consistent postponement of deadlines . #% It is a very bad trade union habit and one that we should get away from . #% Following this Parliament 's delegation to Peru last September and the very serious reports given to us by Congressman Canseco in Brussels earlier this month , it is right that the European Parliament should today join with the protesters in expressing our concern about continuing and systematic human rights abuses in Peru . #% We want to remind the Council that we are concerned here with individuals who should be able to develop their skills and education , benefit from the social security contributions they make and look forward to claiming their pension entitlements , given , as is recognised in the proposal , that their work supports our economies and indeed our societies . #% We appreciate the exigencies of negotiating a new type of agreement but we on the Fisheries Committee feel that we want to be kept better informed about what is going on . #% We have to recognise the difficulties in obtaining funding for space exploitation , space research , space utilisation . #% Mr President , the recent conference in Vancouver was actually called ` One World , One Hope ' , but it soon became very clear that there are two worlds when it comes to fighting this disease . #% I say to both of them , and in particular to representatives of the Council here , we have risen to that challenge and we now expect Member Governments to behave with the same speed to get this legislation transposed . #% We also share something of the suffering of the political prisoners and their families who have chosen to starve themselves to death . #% Perhaps we should publicise it a bit more , although I suspect that would get us into even more trouble with the electorate . #% We share the rapporteur 's dilemma that we can not provide the resources that will improve the conditions and the lifestyle of our citizen body . #% We know what has to be done , but it is no use standing there saying that until the Commission acts or until Parliament acts , you will do nothing . #% Mr President , I too almost feel that I should be doing something to help Mr Alexander out , but , as a lawyer , it does not appear to me that there will be enough money in the EU budget to pay my fees . #% They are absolutely crucial and we have not sought in any way to alter that part of the process . #% We must welcome the fact that agreement has been reached to lift some restrictions on food aid destined for those in dire need , but all possible pressure must be maintained to ensure that humanitarian aid gets through everywhere . #% If we are honest we all know the problems that long hours of work bring for health and safety , productivity and social relationships , both for the individual and within the family . #% Mr President , I wish to echo the disappointment expressed by Pauline Green when she responded on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists at the beginning of this debate . #% I am proud to have voted for this resolution and very much regret the antagonistic approach taken by some colleagues to its being tabled . #% If there is one across-the-board criticism of the report from the industry , it is that perhaps it does not go far or fast enough . #% I would stress , as the Commissioner did , that this proposal deals with animal health . #% Such matters should be dealt with internally by the individual Member States . #% Madam President , we have heard a great deal over the last few days about some of the values which we hold dear , especially those of democracy and freedom . #% This advantage is at present distorted by the fact that different types of sales promotion exist in member states and therefore cross-border price transparency is effectively distorted . #% It was felt that a young institution should have time to find its feet . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by taking the opportunity of wishing Mr Spencer well in the future and expressing the hope that his considerable abilities can be put to good use . #% That is patently stupid . #% 
We want to get to the bottom of the situation . #% Firstly , looking at the overall relationship , it is quite clear - as our two speakers have said - that since 11 September 2001 we have seen a significant change in the way in which the Americans view their place in the world . #% I am thinking particularly of the European security and defence policy , which is not about security but about the trappings of the EU State . #% Finally , the UK Independence Party , and in particular my colleague Mr Farage , has drawn attention to the criminal activities of more than one Commissioner . #% In these circumstances , does he accept that any impression that the European Union is weakening its approach - and that impression to some extent has been given by withdrawing the complaint in the WTO - will in fact damage our trade ? #% From that a number of things stand out . #% Is this some form of cohabitation √† la fran√ßaise I ask myself ? #% I would particularly like to comment on two of the many good points in this report . #% Since we can see that indeed no such action has been agreed within the IMO , I hope very much that the Commission will go ahead and initiate such actions without further delay . #% I am sorry to have to say that because we have made some progress , but without the commitment to a disability directive we have not gone far enough . #% It is very important that the common EU asylum system - which ought , however , to be a single system and incorporate EU funding - should not be based on the lowest common denominator . #% They want a fair and sensible taxation system and measures that must be taken in cooperation between government and industry . #% This seems odd because they do not have Members in this House . #% I can not add much to what has been said already , except to highlight perhaps two areas of concern . #% In addition , my colleague Mr Eisma who is very involved in environmental issues has tabled an amendment asking for a mid-term review of the Senegal agreement to check whether or not it is working correctly in terms of impact on local fisheries and the state of stocks . #% I have a couple of questions . #% You need to look at all the changes that took place in committee . #% I have met the ambassador and the ministers of fisheries from South Africa on a number of occasions and I hope I can be assured that the Commission will not press the South Africans to open their waters to European Union fleets before they want to or before they decide to . #% Yes , there are issues to be answered on human rights and a whole range of other aspects . #% We also need to ensure that , whatever measures are put in place , our businesses will be left as competitive as possible , both domestically and in terms of overseas competition . #% After an outbreak that brought our rural communities to their knees , we only have four sniffer dogs to try and prevent contaminated meat entering the country . #% It is said that some of these people receive funds from Iran and other fundamentalists centres in the Middle East and that there are people in Europe who are supporting them . #% There is also information about policy development and specific action in relation to 17 thematic issues . #% We have before us an opportunity to concentrate the minds of both the Commission and the recipients - Member States and others - of this valuable EU assistance , on the criticisms identified in the report in many areas concerning the allocation of funds and the lack of monitoring of their use . #% The anniversary of the end of the War should not be used as another opportunity to eulogise the role of the EU , a Project with some profoundly undemocratic aspects and which is heading in the wrong direction . #% With regard to employment in particular , it is essential first and foremost to implement existing legislation , particularly the 2000 Employment Directive . #% Is the House aware that the Strawberry Regulation permits expedited procedures for the owners of goods delayed by this type of action to receive compensation , but does not give the same rights of compensation to tourists and other travellers ? #% And that must be the message that comes from this House in this debate and from the European Union . #% I wish we had more like here and I wish those outside knew the work that really goes on in the interstices of this Parliament . #% As these countries become more developed , more western diseases will become endemic , and a case will be made to extend the categories even further . #% -- Mr President , since you invite me -- and I have been provoked by colleagues -- what is the point in running an assembly which indicates that votes are due to take place at 12 noon , but which then start at 12.40 p.m. ? #% I tend to agree and perhaps there are also certain parallels with the position between Transnistria and Moldova , which we touched on yesterday in Parliament . #% In fact Amnesty International very recently published a report which clearly said that people are being held in leg-irons , in chains and beaten into unconsciousness as they work on the railways and roads of that country . #% It is a pretext for gold plating to allow , for instance , the 15 years storage that Poland wants , a wider list of data used for purposes far removed from law enforcement and access for any public or private agency , and all with a convenient Brussels stamp of approval . #% I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House . #% Well , there might have been agreement between the Quad countries , but it certainly was not endorsed by the African countries , the LDCs , India , Malaysia , Indonesia , the list goes on . #% Madam President , we all welcome that statement and hopefully the Conference of Presidents will address this matter . #% Recently a Commission official said to me that we could not do this . #% These proposals are certainly ambitious but many governments dispute whether they are politically realistic , and having just come from a difficult - albeit ultimately successful - group meeting of my own , I know that many Members have doubts . #% Member States could help by recognising this as a valid reason for unemployment . #% It seems that September 11 has been a catalyst for a cosy relationship between Russia and the US , in which the US turns its eye the other way . #% There are no less than 157 cases still pending and I regret to have to say that in many cases the European Commission has not been able to act , to bring cases to the Court of Justice , because it does not know what is happening in Member States as the countries concerned have not reported back to Brussels on what they are doing about legislation . #% That is one of the problems with Amendment No 12 as it stands . #% Nevertheless , it is clear that an organisation banned as a terrorist organisation , such as Hamas , can not be a legitimate interlocutor for the EU , nor receive a penny of our taxpayers ' money until it forswears violence and recognises the state of Israel . #% This move clearly represents a slippery slope towards a system where the prerogatives of national governments are diminished and those of the regions are enhanced . #% More worryingly , the annex covering the issues which fall outside the priorities runs to 50 pages . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , you made some remarks at the beginning of the debate about free and fair elections and good representative government and you asked us to support the people of Tunisia . #% I was disappointed that the Minister was unable to answer most of my points , saying that this has nothing to do with the Council and is more a matter for Member States . #% I concur with our rapporteur that it is somewhat of a scandal that this report has been sat on for over a year since it was adopted in the committee and is only coming now , almost at the last minute , to plenary to be settled . #% Europe must not act at the level of the lowest common denominator but accept that in politics , as in war , there must be room for leadership . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commissioner 's statement and , in particular , that she speaks on behalf of the Commission in deploring the latest developments in the Council over the CO2 energy tax . #% I shall quote one in his absence on his behalf - ` Just for a handful of silver he left us , just for a ribbon to stick on his coat ' . #% We need to tell the Estonians and the Latvians that , if they continue that treatment , their prospects of joining the European Union will be that much less . #% We can only be held accountable and be effective if people understand what we do for them . #% Despite several years of study and consultation , even the so-called `` experts '' within this field admit that the science involved in so-called social marginal costing - the process by which these charges are set - is untested and uncertain . #% Thirdly , should we consider the interests of small businesses ? #% All this underlines the importance of the Council and Commission expressing the deepest concern about the ruthless means employed to suppress opposition everywhere and seeking to end the export of arms to Indonesia . #% The completion of the internal market is also something we can endorse and the effective implementation of the Services Directive will be an important element in this . #% But it is vital on this occasion that those who committed so appalling a crime should not be allowed to avoid the consequences of their acts . #% Therefore , that particular issue is there because it affects a large number of people . #% And the fact that two or three existing EU Member States will not be part of Schengen creates complications which will need to be resolved . #% Solidarity symbolised then , as it does now , hope in the future , the determination of people to build better lives for themselves and their families and an unshakeable belief in the power of the human spirit . #% Reaching a deal will mean that single farm payments are not delayed , and funding for Structural Funds is not affected . #% We must get the message over that we have to be able to cross those national borders , and the ratification of the Convention clearly is a very high priority . #% The UK , with less regulation , probably has the safest roads in Europe . #% It may be that the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is limited but the hazards posed by radioactive release were all too graphically demonstrated by Chernobyl and the nuclear disaster in the Urals so graphically described by Roy Medvedev . #% 
Parliament has the opportunity , if it is willing to grasp it , to set a realistic timetable for the two-tier implementation of a comprehensive process of labelling for beef and for beef products . #% Parliament wants to help . #% Especially objectionable would be a flight from QMV concerning the provisions on social security for migrant workers ; the suppression of codecision from the clauses on the framework programme for research and development ; the re-insertion of the national veto and the suspension of the legislative rights of this Parliament in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters ; and the unwelcome supplement to the progressive clauses of a right of veto for any single national parliament -- a certain recipe for frustrating the decisions of the European Council and for bringing on the ultimate sclerosis of the European political system . #% Mrs M√ºller has addressed this problem . #% Petitioning Parliament is an essential right for the citizens of Europe . #% Mr President , within our groups in Parliament and within the IGC itself we are still struggling with the problems that proved fairly intractable at Amsterdam . #% Madam President , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report . #% You will recall that this Parliament had insisted that under no circumstances should the Zimbabwean Foreign Minister be invited to the Copenhagen Ministerial Conference , as this would be in flagrant breach of the EU travel ban . #% But it is not at all clear in my mind that caning is illegal under international law , as stated in the resolution . #% The decision of whether or not stem cell research should go forward and the kind of research which Mr Liese was dealing with in his report would be much better dealt with in the national context than in some rather remote European one . #% On the Green Paper on consumer protection , which was first brought to us in October 2001 , we have now finally come to the stage of an ambitious debate on these proposals for a genuine internal market for consumers . #% However , I have to say I am pleased to see that Parliament is addressing an issue which the Commission has failed even to acknowledge : that of vintage vehicles . #% But the formal process of negotiation and the aspiration to take reform forward are clearly not enough . #% It would be helpful to have a longer debate on Wednesday and not take the Ghent Council with the question of terrorism . #% Our culture should allow for a balance between the sexes and people should be able to develop their talents wherever they lie , but our culture and values at the moment do not reflect that belief . #% We spoke to farmers , the tourism industry , people and rural businesses . #% A milestone instrument , it will complement the European Convention on Human Rights now being incorporated by the Labour Government into UK law . #% Only when we have determined this can we begin the process of implementing Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam . #% If we ignore it , then REACH and all future chemicals regulation will be tied to test methods that deserve only to be consigned to history . #% It certainly deserves our full support and it is in line with the sort of comments that you , Commissioner , have just made to the previous report , which shows that the European Union is an organ and vehicle for good and for positive legislation . #% Mr President , a few weeks ago we returned from the Johannesburg Summit with the demands ringing in our ears that fine words should be turned into real action in the knowledge that Europe 's pledges were being greeted with cynicism by journalists and the public . #% What he did not talk about is the future of the UN if we do not take effective action to enforce 12 years of resolutions that have not been followed . #% Of course what it should have said is that it does not intend putting any further money into the European Union budget and , in fact , wants money back . #% We still very much need to push that message home in relation to Bosnia . #% It is linked to drug smuggling , terrorism and forgery of bank notes . #% Mr President , the recent conflict between Israel and Hizbollah is a tragedy for Israel and the people of Lebanon . #% And I would point out to Mrs Scallon that the term `` Family '' has been used politically to exclude more people than it has ever been used to include . #% You only have to look at history , at Prohibition in the USA , when there was zero tolerance of alcohol : what a wonderful success that was in solving all the problems they had in the United States ! #% What will they do in 20 years ' time when they are sitting with their grandchildren on their knees and their grandchildren say : ` What was your real role in the great disaster when Europe failed to grasp its own destiny ? #% The Kurdish extremists must end their terrorism . #% Last night he clearly pointed out that we have the prospect of a successful European economy ahead of us for the next two or three years and quite clearly , if we have unexpectedly higher-than-normal growth , then that will help us in the endeavours of this annual legislative programme . #% A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings . #% More importantly , patients and our constituents in every Member State will be grateful if these safeguards are maintained . #% In that respect I would hope that the transatlantic dialogue will develop a democratic arm and include more and more elected politicians as a small step to getting beyond what is , I repeat , a rather dangerous emerging democratic deficit in this new world trading order . #% My particular role in introducing it today is to look at our strategy as a group , one which we have accumulated over the past couple of years . #% Get this right in establishing Europe 's single market , and we are quids in , or should I say euros in ? #% I thank the President-in-Office for that reply . #% I am pleased to say that so far the European Union has maintained an honourable position . #% I have put down an amendment , our group has put down an amendment , to make sure that we can have a report from the Commission on how far this has gone . #% Today my colleague Mrs Cerdeira told me of the tragic crash last week of an old CN-235 , converted from military use , on a Melilla to Malaga flight , with loss of life . #% If you really want to fire up small business in the European Union , and particularly the United Kingdom , I would suggest that these people here and the Commission get their blasted noses out of everybody else 's business and stop trying to tell us how we should run our businesses ! #% I know that will not please colleagues in my Group , but we have to live in the real world and recognise the limits of our competencies . #% Sadly , of course , it is a mirage , because nothing is ever as it seems in the European Union . #% I conclude , Mr President , on a point for our institution . #% Mr President , in Parliament earlier today there was some discussion about the future shape and direction of the European Union post-Nice . #% Is the presidency aware that there are many EU citizens of Kashmiri origin - not least in my own constituency - who are very worried , and increasingly worried , about the wellbeing of their relations ? #% We have now agreed on a timetable to get the new authority up and running . #% UN member states must declare their readiness now to deploy , equip and support a multinational force under the leadership of the Canadians . #% I have a number of additional concerns about the ICC , such as command responsibility , which blames military commanders even if they had no knowledge of the crimes committed , and also the fact that amnesties and peace and reconciliation processes would become more difficult to achieve between belligerents . #% Mr President , in March I took part in a UK delegation studying human rights violations in Chiapas in southern Mexico and tonight , as we consider the EU-Mexico Agreement with its human rights clause , I want to describe the situation there . #% I close by saying that I welcome this report . #% This Parliament will give them some advice in its resolution today , and I hope they will take notice . #% We have been able to work with the Commissioner - and here I pay tribute to Michel Barnier who seized that opportunity to work with us - to express this as a political priority in the form of the Single Market Act . #% We can never take aviation safety for granted . #% The ELDR has tabled three amendments of its own . #% I know that my colleagues elsewhere in the Commission share this view , which I share with the honourable Member . #% Which Member States have the incineration capacity ? #% I am delighted the Council has knocked that figure down to 46 % . #% The UK Independence Party MEPs will therefore vote against this report in the interests of protecting our borders against further illegal immigration . #% in writing . - The establishment of this office is yet another step towards a common EU asylum and immigration policy , which is a policy I totally reject . #% That , I think , means it is not clear enough , and we have not got to a position where , certainly , a lot of Members on this side and in other groups would like to be , where we can say with absolute certainty that the position Mr Kirkhope hopes he has achieved has actually been such . #% But it is a matter for substantial concern that preamble D actually says that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , in its 53rd session expressed its condemnation . #% Croatia has made good progress in adopting the Community acquis , the anti-corruption body USKOK has intensified its work and legislation has been introduced to reform the Croatian judiciary . #% It could be extended , but our commitment is for three years . #% Secondly , NGOs feel that they are being unfairly denied access to core funding . #% It is therefore essential that we get this methodology right or else all the tests and screening in the world will be simply worthless . #% 
In their own private boardrooms they have looked at the figures and recognised that they could make more profits out of SUVs and four-wheel drives , and they have deliberately decided that they are not going to fulfil that commitment . #% There is a widely held perception in some parts of Africa that liberal democracies are trying to push their own , more tolerant , values on societies with very different and ancient traditions . #% It is against this background that the Joint Aviation Requirements , known as JAR-OPS , agreed by the JAA in 1995 , are now being transposed into European Union law . #% I abstained on some paragraphs in this report that were contradictory or whose implications have not been fully costed or worked out . #% I have submitted just three amendments after discussions with the Commission . #% As I listened , I actually wrote the heading ` Plan ' on a sheet of paper , where I intended to make notes of the information you would give us about what the EU was going to do . #% He wondered to what extent legislation should delve into details and gave an example involving people holding ladders . #% author . - Mr President , I will be talking about Belarus and not Hungarian domestic politics . #% Mr President , as someone who was at the forefront in instigating the setting up of this committee , I would personally like to thank President Cox for his invaluable help and all those Members who have made this report and this committee such a resounding success . #% A few years ago I read the Court of Auditors ' report on a number of these fisheries agreements which raise particular questions and doubts as to whether there are benefits to the countries concerned . #% This morning we have them in four . #% Economically , legally and socially , Poland , and especially the Baltic States still have much ground to make up . #% In particular , I want to refer to the guidelines as approved by the Council . #% This is its most objectionable element . #% The EU is actually part of the problem , not the solution . #% The fly in the ointment is the word ` possibly ' , which is in the Commission 's draft . #% Balancing these pressures has been quite a performance , particularly on behalf of the Commission , and for that we say thank you . #% At least , however , this Parliament is receiving a report , something which the Prime Minister failed to give the British House of Commons in the aftermath of the event . #% We should be clear that the EU must immediately reopen dialogue with the legitimately and democratically elected representatives . #% First of all let me thank Mr Solana and Mr Patten for their statements . #% As they have both said , we have reached a very critical stage in these negotiations . #% Mr President , the enlargement of the European Union - not whether , but how - is the great challenge for Europe in the next decade . #% There are many areas where action really needs to be taken by Member States . #% However , over those lines that we do have supervision we express our concerns and have done so in the past . #% Commissioner , I would first like to thank your staff : Mrs Nikolay was outstanding , as was Mr Trojan . #% Let us be flexible enough to accept what should happen . #% The Charter will , for the first time , set out all the fundamental rights enjoyed by EU citizens on one piece of paper . #% It is important to understand -- wherever we import food from anywhere in the world -- that there is always a risk of bringing a disease into the European Union . #% That is a positive step forward . #% It is , as Commissioner Byrne said , appropriate that we are here just as those long and arduous deliberations are taking place in Johannesburg . #% Mr President , I think Mr Wuermeling is correct . #% The President is looking into the question of complaints to the Commission , but he said clearly this is an issue that Parliament would itself want to address . #% Within the euro zone it is not surprising that constraints have been imposed on public spending decisions because if you have , to all intents and purposes , a joint bank account you are affected by the spending decisions of others and you can expect to want some control over those spending decisions . #% But to pretend , as Mr Stevens did , that to vote against the presidency of Mr Duisenberg helps either the euro or the role of this Parliament is a misrepresentation of the truth and is a deception . #% We must recognise that the way in which we are selling food in the European Union is a problem : supermarkets force down prices , thereby increasing the risk of a dangerous virus spread . #% So did the association agreement of 1961 , but will the European Union , with Turkey as a full member , really be fully capable of acting and democratically accountable ? #% One particular issue is the question of the immunity of state bodies from prosecution and whether this applies to the New China News Agency . #% First , that Parliament is fully committed to the democratic oversight of committees that establish implementing legislation . #% But I should like to make one political point : it is imperative to reconvene the talks between South and North Korea under the copresidency of the USA and China . #% American consumers are in love with larger , heavier and more thirsty vehicles . #% If Copenhagen ends up with endless rows over highly technical issues conducted in ten parallel negotiation sessions , it does not take a brain surgeon to realise the whole process could easily seize up . #% The original clean-up from the original disaster could have been done much better and more effectively . #% These are areas which should remain a matter for the exclusive competence of Member States . #% I really do not think I could do that again . #% We need to be aware of these issues . #% I therefore have an appreciation of the scale of the disaster in Indonesia and the Andaman Islands . #% Do we really want novices piloting the biggest container ships in the world up narrow tidal waterways and trying to berth them safely ? #% Mr President , the European Council should understand that the British people have never voted to be governed by former communists , especially those who helped to enforce the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe . #% I am impatient for further change . #% Yet , for reasons which they both express clearly , the Council and Commission today see everything in the reasonably short term , rather than providing a longer-term vision of our relationship with the United States . #% . -- Mr President , I agree that Commissioner Kyprianou commendably treads the narrow line between effective prevention and pressing the panic button . #% We can afford it and so can the other developed countries . #% What we need is an objective analysis , and I ask the Commission and the Council to come forward with proposals on that basis . #% I intend to disregard half of Benjamin Disraeli 's words of wisdom . #% We must remember the greatest contribution we can make to peace and stability is the enlargement of the European Union . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for her detailed reply but I wonder if she is herself aware that third-country nationals applying for visas in London to visit Belgium have to wait at least three weeks , and all such applications are processed by the Foreign Ministry in Brussels , which leads to quite extensive delay . #% If we accept that the EU can deal directly in any way with the regions , we are compromising national integrity , and the nation as the prime building-block of the EU . #% It is a very balanced piece of work covering quite a wide range of views . #% Bus services in rural areas -- where many people are elderly and rely on public transport -- will be jeopardised due to the inflexibility of this proposal . #% Musharraf stated the militants were linked to al-Qa ` ida . #% Mr President , experience has taught me that when bureaucrats and politicians resort to jargon , citizens should guard their wallets . #% Before I have my minute , could you tell me if the Minister is intending to reply to all the questions separately or is that the complete answer to all ten ? #% Mr President , I wish to express my congratulations to the three rapporteurs whose reports are before us today and to say that we should not be too pessimistic that so much remains to be done fifty years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . #% I am proud that today we are legislating . #% Even the 2000 budget of EUR 1.54 million would not be committed . #% In addition , we are by no means convinced by the health arguments on smoking and tax . #% 
This is not the prerogative of four or five people sitting in a smoke-filled , or any other , room . #% The petitioners were also able to give absolute proof of their normal place of residence by appropriate means , such as identity cards or other valid documents . #% We know that the electoral register has also had a very positive effect already , certainly for a number of women from poorer families and backgrounds , who feel that at last they have an identity , that they can now borrow small amounts of money to set up their own businesses etc. . #% We are dealing with health emergencies that are within the competence of the European Union . #% Our efforts on Thursday and Friday last week , during the hearings , have given both ourselves and others in the wider world a glimpse into the hearts and minds of our future ECB governors , in a way which has never been witnessed before . #% We hope that our political groups will take up that message when looking at the budget and decisions in that area . #% As you rightly say , Commissioner , everything else being equal , EU citizens should be able to move between Member States and the administrative burden should be reduced to that which is absolutely necessary . #% And it will of course make a vital contribution to ensuring that we meet our environmental obligations . #% For years the people of Zimbabwe have suffered under the vicious , bigoted and corrupt Mugabe regime . #% This twinning is an important political and social union and I very much hope you will welcome the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress here in Strasbourg . #% Firstly , it makes the case for a wider IGC than the three so-called Amsterdam left-overs . #% The issues about the role of Parliament have centred around our relationship with the Director in terms of his or her appointment and ongoing links . #% If it is not placed on the agenda this week this is clearly going to cause difficulties for the committee in question . #% The report shows the European union in a very bad light . #% Leave successful islands alone . #% That mystifies me absolutely . #% It is only those of us who still live in the past , Mr Bowe , who find it challenging and ambitious . #% My office will provide details to any Members who wish to attend . #% This is a very important resolution not just for Senegal but because it sets a marker . #% We need to stand very firm on this . #% Israel is diverting attention from the agreement between Fatah and Hamas that recognises the 1967 borders . #% Lithuania has agreed to close Ignalina for good when the pressure tubes need replacing . #% Operation Atalanta was conceived as a political opportunity to add a maritime dimension to ESDP during the French Presidency . #% Nor can we expect sustainability to be achieved through decommissioning alone . #% On behalf of the PPE-DE Group , I welcome the government of Ukraine 's invitation for me to attend -- with six other MEPs -- as an observer in Kiev . #% It has been , at times , as Mr Bourlanges said earlier , rather nerve-wracking . #% I am opposed to steps being taken which will eventually lead only to GMO-free or to non-GMO products being labelled if such a thing is possible , because this will result in normal foods being classified as special and transfer the burden of proof and costs away from GMO producers . #% I believe that this work is best left to national governments , who are best geared to evaluate the needs of their citizens - as , indeed , the report says . #% You have been in charge of overseeing that the Constitutional Treaty was pushed through . #% This should include comparison with other countries , including the United States , keeping our aim of fostering a competitive business and investment environment . #% Finally , I turn to the issue of a referendum . #% The situation in Europe , quite frankly , is an affront to civilised society ; it is an affront to civilisation to have abuse of children and to have , in effect , the return to Europe of slavery . #% So I would , again , ask the Commission to look at this question . #% I hope that we will evaluate the work that was done in the previous programmes to ensure that these are not just another new layer but are actually a new beginning for the programmes that can present us with an educated European citizenry . #% From the UK we have Mr Mandelson , who will take on the trade portfolio . #% I welcome the release of the EUR 450 million of EU humanitarian aid , and do not accept the pleas of innocence and , to date , impunity of the brutal regime in Khartoum , which must be held to account for its brutal crimes . #% The Economic Committee had worked out a timetable that would have taken two or three weeks to give proper consideration to this matter . #% The special message I want to put to the Commissioner is that I hope she will take this forward and become the champion of consumers in the e-world and in e-commerce , because , as she said , it is not just her services that have a share in this - it is also those of Mrs Reding and of Mr McCreevy , and , indeed , of Mr Frattini and of Mr Verheugen , in his role as champion of enterprise , in particular small enterprise . #% Mr President , I do not share the enthusiasm of my colleagues for the results of this conciliation but I am equally warm in my congratulations to both rapporteurs . #% The Bureau requested that Members who were over 60 when they retired , had served at least two terms in the European Parliament and were prepared to pay on the same basis as all the staff one third of the costs of the scheme , would as is the case for every member of staff of this institution be admitted to a sickness scheme if they did not have adequate national insurance . #% So to evaluate these proposals as a whole , we should look at what we are competing against , to see what practice , or what common practice there is in the market-place . #% I was impressed by the way he commented on Parliament 's amendments , and I was impressed by the way he offered talks with Parliament to resolve this matter by the end of April . #% Madam President , I rise to ask you if you will join with me in expressing your concern to the Turkish judicial authorities about the delays in bringing to trial those persons involved in the affray that took place in Galatasaray , Turkey on the occasion of a football match with Leeds United in April 2000 . #% As Mr Harbour and the Commissioner have pointed out , simplification is part of this proposal and that is very important . #% The future of Bangladesh also depends on its youth . #% But it is a further recognition that the EU is well placed to enact measures to protect the health of its citizens . #% I wanted it to go further but what is here is good for chickens and consumers . #% Secondly , on the issue of ` naming and shaming ' , nobody could be against freedom of information -- we are all in favour of transparency and openness -- and not to be in favour of it would be to support secrecy . #% There is a huge gap to the north of London , in Essex , Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire . #% I would like to make two points on behalf of my group , the first relating to competition . #% That is going to cause huge administrative and financial problems for this Parliament . #% Since 1992 not a single one has been proved to be sustainably harvested . #% Turning to the Buitenweg report , I should also like to emphasise the very clear emergence of interinstitutional cooperation in environmental and transport matters and as regards an interinstitutional recruitment office - which I very much hope will soon be up and running , to ensure that European citizens get the best value for money . #% In the United States in 1994 , there was a case connected with contaminated ice cream where nearly a quarter of a million people became ill . #% But I also hope again that you will apply pressure to the Commission to speed up its work on the revision of the European Works ' Council Directive . #% I will support the common position . #% An engine that was made in Brazil is now going to be made in Birmingham , in my constituency . #% Europe needs to play a role in the rest of the world . #% The resistance of these peoples and the brutal attempts of past Bangladeshi governments to crush this led to gross violations of human rights of which the non-combatants were frequently victims . #% So it should simply be common sense to evaluate current policies , assess their effectiveness and consider alternative options . #% It is happening now , away from the guns , bombs and rockets , and that is what we should be involved in . #% Does not everyone realise that small firms throughout the European Union need some extra time and assistance to cope with their full responsibilities and do this job properly ? #% I am pleased to support the rapid reaction facility and I do so as a Member of Parliament 's Development Committee . #% The situation in C√¥te d'Ivoire is primarily about the blame game . #% Can I say that we really do expect progress before the Ides of March 2011 . #% She has done a tremendous amount of work on it . #% 
That reference was deleted and we want to know why . #% There has been no solidarity among European Union countries and that is disgraceful . #% So I am disturbed to find that I missed most of the speech of my colleague Mrs McCarthy , because the debate appears to have started at least ten minutes early . #% If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments . #% I would be very interested to hear from the Commission what plans it has for the long-term future to ensure that this fishery is reduced quite substantially , or at least that it will not have a damaging effect on the marine environment in the long term . #% The European Union destroys jobs -- as Tony Blair said in his 1983 election address . #% On the way to European independence we may have to work with those trying to catch up with the US 's enormous lead . #% The right to property is a fundamental right . #% Madam President , we may be horrified , but we should not be surprised by the nature of recent acts of terrorism . #% Currently , the majority of farms can be identified through their participation in these schemes . #% Only a true partnership will ensure these agreements are beneficial to all parties . #% Very soon now the government is about to raise GBP 16 billion through the sale of the third generation mobile telephone licences as Mr Suominen reminded us . #% I urge colleagues to back the rapporteur 's proposal and I urge the Commissioner to bring forward a very clear timetable . #% Stick to it ! #% The basic cause of the problem is overpopulation in Bangladesh and the settlers often come from very poor families who hope for a better life . #% In response to Mr Harbour 's questions relating to whistle-blowing and to the code of good administrative behaviour , obviously we require changes to the Staff Regulations in order to secure the necessary advances on the existing legislation relating to the duty to report suspected wrongdoing that has an effect on the financial wellbeing of the European Communities . #% We certainly need a framework for the open method of coordination which is clear , is democratically controlled by this Parliament , national parliaments and sub-national parliaments - which in some Member States are those with responsibility for particular issues . #% Mr President , I want to raise with Parliament the deteriorating situation in Darfur . #% We need to work closely with the United Nations and with the special rapporteurs as well as the NGOs . #% We need to discuss whether we should support that provision in the final report or ask the Commission and Council to look at this before it finally comes back . #% On financial matters , we have the situation where Agenda 2000 is linked with agreements on future financing . #% For all of these reasons , I welcome the support that we are giving to culture and to cultural industries , support to small and medium-enterprises , which I think - in the current economic climate - are possibly going to be the backbone of what we will be looking at . #% It was literally only yesterday that I received an e-mail from the Commission stating that there was such information but it had been sent to the Committee on Budgets rather than to our committee - again , not too impressive . #% This is a country which has dragged itself from being one of the poorest and now at least has some sort of infrastructure . #% So , would the President-in-Office please give us an undertaking that he and the Federal Finance Minister and the Federal Chancellor will not be persuaded by the powerful lobbying of what Mr Corbett has referred to as the ` cigarette and alcohol ' lobby ? #% It is vital that this risk-sensitive framework should be potentially applicable to a wide range of credit institutions , both large and small . #% Secondly , may I ask if this report has led the Commission to make any recommendations to change the format of pre-accession aid in order to strengthen the work in one area as opposed to another area ? #% If your comments are true and you can cut a deal by June , then Mr Blair must have agreed in principle to surrender the rebate . #% Nor can we agree with paragraph 10 . #% Without endorsement of this Programme , Europe could never hope to become a world player in the field of research and technology , where we are lagging seriously behind the US . #% Eritrea is a very poor country and alone in Africa -- the other exception being the Democratic Republic of Congo -- in postponing indefinitely the elections promised by President Afeworki 's so-called transitional government under the 1997 Constitution and originally scheduled for December 2001 . #% We agree on the need to ensure stricter adherence to equal opportunities and environmental objectives in all of the programmes . #% That has immense consequences , of course , not only for the fishermen but for all those involved on shore and for the consumer . #% I hope that this Parliament will not accept a situation which jeopardises a European initiative of which we have been justifiably proud . #% Human rights must not become a device that helps give comfort , even financial compensation , to those such as terrorists , themselves the worst abusers of human rights . #% It makes the case that the world ' s 16 000 commercial jet aircraft produce more than 600 million tonnes of CO2 every year - nearly as much as all the countries of Africa put together . #% As with many other areas of business we debate , I fear that this would only be the thin end of the wedge in terms of EU interference with taxation : further treaty creep would most probably follow . #% This is against the backdrop of a suicide bomber in Moscow last week killing six innocent civilians . #% Where it is best used , where its natural properties are best used and need not be modified , e.g. in construction products and in specialist products like blood bags , it is an extremely useful , very important plastic and very difficult to replace . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - President Barroso , I know that the European Trade Union Confederation has already raised very strong objections about the detailed interference by the Commission in the Greek and Irish labour markets , riding roughshod over collective bargaining and social dialogue . #% in writing . - The ECR Group are strong proponents of working to bridge the gender gap for self-employed workers and their partners . #% Mr President , this is the second time that I have spoken in a legislative assembly in support of a British Prime Minister contemplating sending British troops into action in Iraq . #% Of course , we do not wish to mix these things formally ; but let us not be naive . #% I hope that this report will not only be approved but that the Commission will act on its contents . #% This will be the final debate of this cycle , but I am sure we will have many more . #% The proposals being put forward by the EPP have been particularly helpful . #% I will not relaunch that debate , but anyone looking at this splendid Chamber and the palatial public spaces of this building would not believe the cramped conditions in which a backbench MEP works . #% Coordination is just not working . #% We shall not be alone . #% They all lack the financial and human resources to deal competently with applications to stay . #% I hope that one day we will be able to do without them . #% Europe 2020 must not go the same way . #% As Mr Titley said , we will be supportive of a lot of the things that have been mentioned , but the increase of EUR 10 million in the CFSP means that something else in category 4 has to give . #% We quickly discovered a gap between the rhetoric around reducing working hours and the reality of working life for many people . #% It remains a major military power and deserves recognition on the global centre stage . #% This is our support for democratic elections in Africa . #% Presumably if they saw a geological map of Europe , they would claim that Scotland was being merged with Austria because they both have granite , or that the different limestone areas were being merged into transnational regions . #% The second amendment is about the consequences if the conditions of this regulation are not met , in particular as it applies to an air carrier or aircraft operators from third countries , who must be refused access to routes to or within the Community or the right to overfly the territory if they fail to comply . #% We have had over the years a number of petitions from people affected by this . #% It was Pauline 's decision to engage in that piece of street theatre , using the very emotions and concerns of those demonstrators to make a political point at an inappropriate moment in the conduct of this House 's business , which led to the subsequent chaos . #% The report has gained approval from very diverse organizations : from manufacturers and industry , trade union representatives as well as consumer and disability groups . #% I would urge colleagues to vote for the package and against any other amendment , irrespective of its content or merits , because we have an agreement that will enable the Framework Programme to go forward and be implemented in January . #% For the sixth time since President Suharto seized power in 1965 the government-backed Golkar party will win and next year Parliament with other nominees will almost certainly reappoint President Suharto for a seventh five-year term . #% Mr President , my congratulations to Mrs Myller who I know has thought long and hard about this report . #% In any case , if more controls were needed , we should not be looking to the Commission for guidance . #% The Commissioner acknowledged - he is shaking his head now , but I think he acknowledged - that the UK is not in violation of any treaty or legal obligations in terms of requiring imported meat coming into the country from 1 January - which is when the new provision should have come into effect - to be accompanied by certification that specific risk materials have been removed and also to require that that meat , when sold in the shops , is sold off the bone , as is now the case for United Kingdom products . #% 
He has clearly forgotten the deaths of 73,000 French Jews , the concentration camp in nearby Natzweiler-Struthof and the massacre of Jews , Roma and resistance fighters in France during that period , of whom he , at one time , claimed to be one . #% At present our committee is looking carefully at the harmonisation of civil law . #% We also thank Mr Hatzidakis for his excellent report . #% Third , Amendment No 5 , which seeks to give priority to enabling small peasant producers to take advantage of EU trade preferences . #% In addition , we find that part-time workers are dealt with differently in different Member States . #% Go back and look at the report . #% How many qualified inspectors do we have today on our borders , checking the safety and quality of products coming into the European Union ? #% Finally , will there be new money which will go to our towns and cities and which will help them unleash that potential to put people back to work ? #% As always , when you have a heavily lobbied dossier one of the problems is that the lobbies cancel each other out , which demonstrates how Members of the European Parliament have to be able to cope with lobbyists , like they have to be able to cope with journalists . #% It is more useful to look for a pan-EU solution to this problem than for Member States to seek a solution individually . #% I trust that these separate but closely related processes will galvanise the IGC , just as the drive towards the single currency stimulated the Maastricht conference . #% I do not need to tell you that this is a microcosm of your whole action plan for the single market . #% Their lives were malignly regulated down to the smallest detail . #% We must stop this barbaric trade before it is too late . #% With regard to nurse practitioners , nurses should be given more status in developing countries than they now have . #% These people are missing in action and I would hope the Commission and the Council would use this opportunity to get those hostages restored to their families . #% Curiously , the Commission continues to deny Ukraine -- unlike Russia -- market economy status . #% In spite of Article 49 , there is still a serious danger that Moldova and Ukraine will see the process as insufficiently differentiated and as a way of distancing the EU from their just membership aspirations . #% So we will have a chance to go into detail , and I agree with the Commissioner that it would be highly desirable to start the debate in this Parliament . #% In many cases they do not have the civic structures and other organisations in place to properly enforce some of the regulations we would like and some of the monitoring that would take place . #% I can safely say that our experience in Britain , particularly in terms of boosting tourism and bone fide business travel since then , fully indicates that this decision was a good one . #% It seems to me , if one looks at the origin of the coup d'√©tat , that one should follow the money rather than the ethnic relations . #% The first time somebody jumped up and down and the lift started again . #% If we wait for that to happen , I fear the great objectives you have set before us will not be achieved . #% If jargon were the solution , Member State waters would still be teeming with fish , the CFP would be a world-beater . #% Mr President , energy efficiency is arguably the poor relation in the overall supply situation . #% The sum of # 435m was quoted by the regional employers ' organizations . #% I can reassure him that the Commission is very actively engaged in trying to ensure that the best standards are set and maintained and will use all its endeavours to that end . #% This you will have cause to regret . #% Do not make me laugh ! #% However , if a Member wishes to indicate that they are present in the room , despite not wishing to take a view , then they have the option - not the obligation - to press their abstention button which shows that they were there , even though they did not wish to take a position on that particular text or amendment . #% However , I must warn them that this has ended . #% The rapporteur gives the game away when she argues that in the long term it would be of great advantage to approximate the ACT rates -- meaning the same rates of road tax in all countries . #% I would , however , like to thank the Commission for responding in a very positive and constructive manner to the criticisms voiced in this report and , in particular , the exchange of letters between Commissioner Piebalgs and Ms Niebler , which has brought an update to Parliament on the situation . #% Currently the CAP continues to absorb half the EU budget . #% Parliament 's special role inside the accession process is surely to promote the growth of parliamentary democracy in Turkey . #% We note the auditors ' remarks that around 80 % of the transactions of the EU are carried out by agencies working within the Member States under joint management agreements . #% I particularly commend the amendment from the Committee on Budgets that where a film is successful and produces a surplus , then some of that surplus should be paid into the fund . #% It does seem to me rather extraordinary that they are still being held in custody in a fellow Member State , and I wonder if there is something that you can do to bring this matter to the attention of the Greek authorities in order they be released as soon as possible . #% Mr President , when I and my British Conservative colleagues fought the last European elections in 1999 , one of our core policies was that the unsatisfactory character of the terms and conditions which we , as MEPs , enjoy should be revised and updated . #% Can I tempt my right honourable friend to agree that this House was right , and the foreign ministers were wrong , over the decision to permit Burma to attend the ASEM Summit ? #% In this regard we reiterate the need to ensure that each country is dealt with on its own merits . #% Similarly , Amendments Nos 57 , 13 , 46 and 47 have a mistake in the English language translation which renders it nonsensical . #% It will all end in tears . #% Since the advent of DNA testing and mobile communications of a world nature , we have available to us tools for good and for bad . #% A cost must be imputed to those things as well in such a calculation . #% It also gives us a very important opportunity to stress once again in public to Turkey that as far as we are concerned : they are a strategically important country ; we recognise their European vocation ; and they will be treated exactly the same as other countries which seek to join in the European Union in terms of applying the Copenhagen criteria . #% Meanwhile , it is important to note , in order to avoid any misunderstanding , that only the 266 host structures of the first two of these relays and networks -- the IPEs and Carrefours -- have ever received operating grants from the Commission since DG Press started overseeing them in 2001 . #% How am I supposed to justify to my constituents in Leicestershire or Northamptonshire the fact that the admitted level of waste and fraud in the EU institutions at EUR 5 billion is as much as the UK 's annual net budget contribution . #% For instance , there have been references to the national criminal intelligence services of Member States . #% However , I am concerned that Mrs Kaufman 's proposals would lead to the citizens ' initiative process becoming bogged down or hampered by onerous bureaucratic requirements ( like Member States having to check every signature and pre-certification by the Commission that it is legal ) . #% What it does not say is that Members were summoned to vote at noon but that the debate was still continuing . #% For all of the high-minded talk about conservation , the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster . #% Whilst this may be desirable in some areas , cooperation in criminal matters should focus on information sharing , coordination of bodies with some approximation of laws where this is beneficial , but not as a general rule . #% If I understand what is being asked for correctly , the practice already applies in Scotland . #% More important than that in the IGC is a related matter , that of extending qualified majority voting . #% One could find that , as with the car batteries ' recycling - before the EU destroyed it - a new market would be created . #% I would like to see , as Commissioner van den Broek has indicated , us tightening the sanctions and looking to work on a further UN resolution that goes beyond 1199 and makes it very clear that military force could be used if Milosevic does not adhere in every aspect to this agreement . #% I have spent considerable time in Central Europe since the revolutions and I believe that we owe our fellow-Europeans the courtesy of the truth . #% Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on bringing together into his report the different strands of opinion that were expressed in the debate . #% This week , we took a very brave stance on Guant√°namo ; I think we should be doing the same thing when we come to look at what is happening within our own Member States and be absolutely clear that we are not going to tolerate that either . #% These refugees fled acute starvation and utter brutality in Afghanistan to find a haven in Iran and there are huge numbers of new refugees now on the move . #% In Uganda , for instance , the coffee growers are suffering enormously . #% Or we can answer that the EU , through the Commission and Parliament , is about deciding whether or not it should be legal for one person to stand at the bottom of a ladder holding on to it while another person climbs up it . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , the debate we are having about this oral question epitomises so much of what is wrong with the European Union . #% We were particularly pleased in this resolution to highlight the decision of Britain and the other G7 countries to cancel their claims on Haiti 's international debt and to call on other nations to follow . #% 
These guarantees are , of course , echoed in our own Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% There is nothing more important than the safety of the food and the drink that they and their families partake of . #% China naturally rejects further nuclear proliferation and is also worried by its own home-grown Islamist threats . #% They have no guarantee of where the money is to come from in the long term to help them restructure and to diversify both within and outside of sugar . #% I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown . #% This is good news for parliamentary democracy in Europe . #% We recognise that Pakistan is a key ally of the West , as Mr Salafranca S√°nchez-Neyra said . #% It is worth noting that the ten new countries have all had to go through a process of being investigated on a yearly basis by the Commission on their progress towards fulfilling the requirements for membership . #% This sounds fine and I am sure the Member States will welcome that . #% We must have reform before Agenda 2000 runs out in 2006 . #% Strict time-limits would clearly be very useful here . #% I intend to ask questions , Mr President , and I hope we can find a solution to them tomorrow . #% Mr President , Secretary of State Colin Powell and President George Bush are both in Europe this week : Colin Powell to meet with EU Foreign Ministers and President Bush on a state visit to Britain . #% Secondly , there is the importance of encouraging them to have a competitive infrastructure for telecommunications , to bring those costs down , to encourage competition so they can have the same access as us to plentiful , cheap services . #% Please can the Presidency ensure that in future we get our hour of questions ? #% Then we must look to other countries in Africa , Asia and South America to sign up to similar agreements as soon as possible and I look forward to working with you and the Commission to achieve this . #% The proposal calls for improvements to health and safety procedures across the sector and clear declarations of hazardous substances . #% Extremists will and do use the explosive cocktail of terrorism , immigration and asylum and the fear of the stranger to pursue their own agenda , which will diminish the rights of the vulnerable . #% Would it not be a huge , historic mistake to railroad those people into this failing European Union without first telling them the truth ? #% I also accept that the Commission is now making the suggestion that the EU-Russia Summit should be annual rather than every six months , which is a good idea and the way forward . #% The evidence she presented concerns the organisation that Jeremiah was involved in immediately before he met his death and which appears to be a sinister anti-Semitic sect . #% In fact , I believe there are only 90 inspectors for the entire world . #% It clearly says in the document that payments will be restricted , not just for the repayment of outstanding commitments but that payments should be contained elsewhere in the budget so as to make sure we do not go over the ceilings required . #% On the one hand , Mr Corbett wants to give the Parliament equivalency with the Council , suggesting that somehow this improves the accountability of the system and by inference its democratic legitimacy . #% Therefore it seems ridiculous to me to prevent this competition having a team in the UEFA cup when in fact it is the Premier League with whom UEFA has a dispute . #% Therefore , can you reassure us that we will be given the opportunity to receive some answer on this very vital question ? #% Nevertheless , being informed is not the same as being consulted . #% So that Saddam can get his tanks closer to Iran and closer to Kuwait so that he can invade more easily next time . #% As he knows , together with the ELDR Group , we nearly managed to defeat it in committee , but virtually none of our amendments were accepted . #% Is there any sort of timetable within the Commission for looking at these procedures ? #% Madam President , on behalf of the European People 's Party I too am pleased to congratulate Mr S√∂derman on his first report to Parliament and Mrs Ahern on her report . #% Now a new window of opportunity opens , encouraged by the Japanese : a peace plan signed in Manila . #% My view is that the report by our colleague Mrs Wemheuer from the Socialist bench who has not spoken tonight and who resigned in protest at the position of the Socialist Group before Christmas from the Committee on Budgetary Control did indeed examine the institutional questions which were supposed to be examined by the Committee of Wise Men . #% We tried to persuade the Council of Ministers to agree with us and it did not . #% The Chinese Communist Party is a party of murderous gangsters that has no more purpose than the continuation of its own existence . #% This was not the time for us to give our support to this report . #% We must not forget this while we are talking about the crisis in Iraq . #% I welcome the resolution calling for an increased focus on the mobility of citizens and I believe it is also essential that the re-launch of the Single Market focuses on the needs of SMEs in order to provide an environment that will create new , innovative businesses across the EU , and especially in Wales . #% I think that in fact we will see all Member States complying with that section of the directive relating to junior doctors within that nine-year time frame . #% So within the social partners their voice goes virtually unheard , and yet the social partners presume to speak for them . #% This is madness . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , I am very pleased indeed to have this opportunity to discuss this debate . #% Would he also agree that the Cyprus problem will remain intractable and the Balkans fractious and unstable should the Union refuse membership to Turkey ? #% If you read it , it certainly is not . #% He claims that , because Commission staffing has been reduced to some 40 % of its 1992 levels , this indicates much lower priority within the Commission . #% To raise the ceiling in this way is a proper use of funds in the eTEN budget programme . #% I have little to add to his own remarks except to say that I very much support his comments about the need to recognize the merging of the mobile and fixed point telecommunications markets . #% We knew about the problem in January and the Commission 's solution was to send the Info-Points a letter at the end of September . #% The Commission therefore proposes to ensure that staff who do not have access to marriage under the current national legislation are not discriminated against and to provide improved treatment for people who , for personal reasons , choose not to be legally married . #% Experience would suggest that it is not at the level of foreign ministers , still less officials , that the final deal will be cut . #% That surely is not the way to go . #% I am interested to know exactly what we think is possible under the current WTO rules , and whether the Commission agrees with the Vice-President of Levi-Strauss , who was arguing that ILO standards should be part of all bilateral and multilateral trade agreements . #% Too often in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy we ask the CFSP secretariat what the EU stance on a particular situation is , only to be told that we do not have one because the Foreign Ministers have not met yet to discuss the matter . #% Will the President-in-Office make it quite clear to the Turkish authorities that , until some movement takes place on this and other issues , it will be quite impossible for us to achieve any real improvement in the relationship between Turkey and the European Union , which all of us would like to see greatly improved ? #% In a moment I shall refer to some of the issues involved . #% We aim to specify more clearly the other measures that need to taken to protect stocks . #% If no progress has been made by this time , if the dialogue has failed , if we say this is a useless procedure , then at this point it is essential that we adopt so-called smart sanctions . #% I have just seen results from German tests which indicate that the Phase 2 structural standards may not bring about the sort of improvements that we had been expecting . #% Please , Commissioners , do not use the argument that the consumer will decide . #% I ask you to refer this matter to President Prodi as a matter of urgency . #% Beyond this , we have concerns that the `` flexibility '' or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present . #% The competences of the European Court of Justice are undoubtedly a matter of considerable interest . #% My understanding is that if Amendment No 21 is accepted then we can vote for the last sentence of Amendment No 42 which deals with asbestos cement , but we need clarification on that from the President . #% This week we have voted for environmentally-friendly measures designed to encourage more freight on to rail . #% I thank the President-in-Office for doing a sterling job all day here in Parliament . #% If we are then required to move to some kind of satellite system , that really would cause enormous problems , because satellite systems are not designed for urban environments and there would be difficulties of visibility -- of actually seeing traffic in the way that is required . #% 
We now have the ammunition and the tools we need to achieve safety at sea at a much higher and more acceptable level . #% This report wants new criteria which must apply between EU Member States and third countries . #% We have to gain their trust , show our commitment , and then we will be able to keep the terrible disease out of the EU . #% But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing , it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing . #% So the working poor voted with their feet . #% Let us hope that we can continue to work closely with the authorities of Hong Kong to develop a better future for the residents of Hong Kong and to develop Hong Kong 's important status as a keystone in the Asian economy . #% Therefore , it is the responsibility of this Commission to make sure that we promote public investment , that we do not impede it , so that it leads to wider private investment and greater growth opportunities within the European economy . #% However , we need a statement from the President-in-Office of the Council to confirm that the budget is correct and that the Council has no objections to it . #% As draftsperson on the Commission action plan on free movement of workers , I welcome the remarks of Mr De Clercq on obstacles to the free movement of people , such as pension mobility , family responsibilities and the educational needs of children . #% The coalition forces are doing fine work , particularly in the south and in delivering public health to the people of Iraq . #% Whilst I have absolutely no reason to doubt the figure given by the honourable Member , there are different estimates . #% Mr President , the argument put forward by General Pinochet 's legal representatives that his detention in London pending possible extradition to Spain is a breach of certain legal niceties would not have cut much ice with his administration in Chile in 1973 . #% I would say to those who have spoken in the debate - Mr Arroni and Mrs Larive - that we should remember what the market can do . #% The problem is that the process is difficult , complex and very few people understand it . #% But the opt-out is a big issue for us . #% Moreover , this report on distance purchasing ignores the related concept of e-commerce . #% Britain has always felt a special affinity with Poland , and this was evidenced in the early 1980s when Poland was going through very difficult times . #% Action should now be taken to strengthen the EU sanctions with moves to deny Burmese dictatorship the hard currency it uses to fund its repression . #% For example , both the Lifelong Learning and People schemes provide invaluable opportunities to those who want to learn new skills and find new jobs . #% Mr Pirker has spelled out the objections but it is not being consistent when one Member of your group , Mr Helmer , is writing that they should end the automatic rights or end the Geneva Convention and end the automatic right of entry for those deemed to be suffering from persecution . #% The starting point of the Services Directive is the screening of Member States ' laws hindering the establishment of services . #% Firstly , any measures taken must be based on sound scientific evidence ; secondly , they must be proportionate ; and , thirdly , they should not place a further burden of regulation , and thereby cost , on the agricultural and veterinary industries . #% We also need to make sense of often conflicting information on diets and nutrition - I suspect that is of interest to the Commissioner and myself in particular - and to develop coherent new food policies on that basis . #% Concerning Turkey , I would say that we must say to this new government , which is like a breath of fresh air in my opinion : you must meet the Copenhagen criteria . #% Please vote for it . #% Many colleagues propose alternative research methods -- for example , that we should use adult stem cells . #% Every discharge decision is conditional in that it is accompanied by a report with paragraphs of resolution which the Commission undertakes to deal with on receipt of discharge . #% In conclusion , the intervention of the corrigendum , far from making matters easier , makes it worse . #% With the greatest respect to the Commissioner - and I have the utmost respect for his work - to say that everything is in order now is not entirely satisfactory . #% I would like to congratulate him for his U-turn on Russia during the course of the debate . #% Mr President , in every part of the world we see examples of violence and cruelty by individuals and sometimes appalling scenes of mob violence and lynch rule . #% I was one of a number of Members who petitioned the Commissioner to include an assessment in his last report , last November , on this specific issue . #% However , the proposal can and will have real benefits . #% One of the major failures of the Stockholm Summit was in the foreign affairs field . #% Of course we would all prefer all donations to be voluntary . #% However , this evening I would like to pay a particular tribute to the Co-President of the ACP , Glenys Kinnock , who has been away from our circle for some time . #% As Mr Sterckx has said , I was the rapporteur for Parliament 's response to the Commission 's proposals on air transport and the environment last year . #% It is devoid of meaning if you let public authorities off the hook . #% Mr Bourlanges has indicated what we agreed in the committee , indeed amending his own original draft report , but coming to a text which will have a broad majority in this Parliament . #% It is extremely important that the EU does not follow the example of the United States which , in some countries , has unilaterally made drug control assistance conditional on the attainment of crop eradication targets . #% I am delighted that the new Romanian Government has nominated very competent officials to review the problems that these Spanish families are facing . #% Indeed the acting President , Mr Santer , had put out a Code of Conduct for Commissioners and officials but it seemed it did not go far enough . #% We did not make an agreement on what the amounts are for the CFSP . #% The temporary Committee of Inquiry has exercised its powers as it did into BSE as an important new power of Parliament . #% I would like to say to Mr de Roo that no barrier is being put in the way of the advancement of gays and lesbians who are officials by the hierarchy of institutions . #% I have just returned from a visit to Cyprus - one of the accession countries - where I find out that not only is there no fuel duty on the use of petrol but that petrol is actually subsidised . #% Parliament clearly hopes that its views as expressed in this report when voted on tomorrow will be of genuine help to the Commission and the EIF in determining any programme changes for the coming year , in which case the report each year needs to be presented annually in good time well ahead of the year to come so that it can influence what happens in the year to come . #% As MEP for London , I am conscious that many of my constituents originating from places like Grenada , Jamaica and the Cayman Islands have families there who have been affected . #% I hope the Commissioner can confirm that we shall see this directive on the table within this Parliament so that we can expedite the matter early in the New Year . #% Mr President , I visited Iraq 12 days ago . #% Mr President , financial services should be the big winner from e-commerce , because the sector does not have the problems of physical delivery , unlike booksellers or grocery supermarkets . #% We must resist the move to renationalise funding and policy-making . #% My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible . #% I welcome what we have heard about that this afternoon . #% The UK National Association of Pension Funds says that this report will make pensions more expensive - by 90 % according to actuarial consultants Punter Southall . #% There is an issue of proportionality . #% We have had some very emotive speeches on this subject . #% I accept what Mr Kirkhope said a few minutes ago , that there are frictions and difficulties with the system which need to be sorted out . #% I have listened with interest to what Members have had to say and at this stage in the debate I would like to reflect on what this report is really all about . #% We must make our workforce more mobile , and that means more resources at a European level for careers advice and for work experience . #% All we can say is that it is absolutely typical of the way they have conducted affairs over the last five years . #% All EU citizens should have equal rights . #% This device could also be triggered manually and have a voice call so you could communicate with the emergency services . #% Progress on the directive and framework decision setting common penalties for facilitating entry and residence in the EU will be on the agenda at that Council meeting . #% That is something that we have not been able to tackle but that other committees will wish to look at . #% Those are the main points I would like to make . #% 
I am delighted that European scientists in Europe 's regions will get financial reward for their intelligence . #% It is at this point that I wish to distinguish between universal service and universal access . #% Mr President , the proposal for an EU fundamental rights agency is the height of folly , even by the standards of this place . #% Over 120,000 women and children are abducted from Eastern Europe each year to be brought into the EU for exploitation . #% It would be a terrible mistake to entrust this organisation with that amount of information . #% It is also essential to pool and centralise information , and expert analysis when such counterfeiting comes to light . #% I need to correct the record in this regard . #% But we have another task before us and that is to address the reasons fully why 300 000 people chose - in their own time , and at their own expense - to go to Genoa , just as hundreds of thousands have gone to Seattle , to Gothenburg and elsewhere to demonstrate about the continuing debt burden of the poor , about the increasing and grotesque inequalities between rich and poor and about the growing corporate control of many aspects of our lives . #% We also need further action to address demographic change through an integrated approach to safeguard sustainable and universal pensions . #% We must also continue our campaign for a specific disability directive under Article 13 to outlaw discrimination on access to goods and services . #% That has been the central part of our task . #% In fairness , the report is acceptable to all the political groups . #% It is vital that we remember the victims of the current increase in violence and call on the government to protect their rights : human rights , the right of freedom of association and freedom of belief . #% I am sure that this is a point that Mr Colom i Naval would have made . #% But let us remember that there is a significant difference between the depth of sea in which they are operating in the Gulf of Mexico and the depth of the North Sea . #% We agree with the Commissioner that political reasons too often block action by Member States . #% Finally , we should take special measures , as others have said , to preserve rare breeds , an indispensable part of the animal gene pool , so that they are not swept away by some new pandemic . #% Parliament has stuck steadfastly to its view that Member State governments must do far more to prevent this type of pollution , such as arsenic , biocides and cyanide . #% We simply want to know what is likely to happen at New Delhi . #% A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he accepts the legitimacy of the 1990 elections in Burma in which the NLD led by Aung San Suu Kyi were the clear and legitimate winners . #% This is a time when we should be doing just the opposite . #% We have , however , to bear in mind that it is a cheap plastic made from salt and natural gas . #% Thirdly , the Commission has shown a total lack of regard for the plight of these people . #% Worst of all , however , hundreds of local fishermen are being killed each year and , if the excellent Channel 4 documentary on the Mauritanian agreement is any guide , some are being deliberately run down by trawlers engaged in illegal fishing permitted by a deliberately lax , ill-equipped monitoring and enforcement regime . #% This includes EU funding for alcohol and tobacco production , which conflicts with the EU 's health objectives , and EU agricultural export subsidies which harm developing countries , as well as increases in budget lines relating to expenses , travel , publications and other administrative costs . #% We also have the spectacle of the British Government admitting that its hands are tied on this issue because of punitive EU competition law . #% I hope we will vote for the resolution , to demonstrate not only our horror of terrorism but also the desire to find a solution to the tension within this region . #% However , as the report points out , the rises and falls in exchange rates do not necessarily balance each other out and adjustments are necessary to ensure that farmers in one group of countries are not disadvantaged through such monetary movements . #% Omar Deghayes claims that he has been blinded in one eye with pepper spray . #% Could not the principle of the conventional divorce , whereby there is mutual recognition of legal systems in Member States , also be applied in this case ? #% Member States ' intransigence is also highlighted . #% The classic method uses is to shore up the finances and organise a competitive devaluation . #% I simply wish to add a tribute to the members of the emergency services whose prompt and professional actions saved many lives . #% It is true to say that as a committee we found this a frustration . #% On the economic side , the ALDE Group has emphasised the need to avoid regulatory arbitrage in the financial sector and to address issues such as ` too big to fail ' institutions . #% It is some seven years since REACH was first announced to ministers at the Environment Council . #% The thinking behind this report is quite clear because , as everyone knows who has constituents who have written to them and informed them about this barbarous practice and as previous speakers have mentioned , the barbarism which can occur so randomly and leave animals to suffer for so many days is quite clearly unacceptable in a civilized world . #% It is arguable that the European Union is in some ways already more transparent than some of our Member States . #% The central Africa negotiations are portrayed as a model of these regional negotiations . #% The amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets state that the figures do comply with the financial perspectives up to 2006 . #% It is also our duty to be single-minded in our condemnation of terrorism . #% Tonight 's resolution , by regulating the incinerator , relegates it to the option of last resort , and gives hope to 10 000 individual people who have submitted objections in Essex . #% It shows good and effective control of spending and nation-states do not mind passing on that money to the European Union . #% The increasing awareness of the possibility of infringement of environmental law is another instance . #% It is a productive factor . #% But , of course , by 1996 he had been impeached for corruption and the abuse of power . #% There is not one port that welcomes the proposals . #% Regarding TACs and quotas , again I would raise the strategic problem here of ministers debating with scientists through the Commission and coming up with a compromise that allows all ministers to claim victory , while at the same time , scientists are trying to make decisions on the actual scientific state of the stocks . #% They do not actually know what it means . #% The views expressed by those in the House seeking to force early closure and abandonment of the policy in this matter made voting for elements of this report very difficult for pragmatic reasons rather than a particularly pro- or anti-nuclear approach . #% It is unacceptable that for many years many countries simply failed to distinguish properly between professional and consumer investors as is required by the ISD . #% Yet , for a country approaching a fifth of the world 's population , India counts for less than one fiftieth of world trade . #% Previously he had said that the Pact was dead . #% As the author of Parliament 's response to the Commission 's previous waste management strategy I see here a careful development of waste management strategy emphasizing in many ways many of the methods we saw five years ago and helping them to be developed further . #% Indeed the key to reform is ending the war against the Kurds , which gives the pretext for the state of emergency and the repression that goes with it . #% Mr President , bearing in mind , Commissioner , that the WTO referred the US call for sanctions to arbitration and that a panel has been established to determine whether the proposed new EU regime is in fact illegal , can you now assure this European Parliament , as my colleagues have asked you to do , that the Commission will not bow to illegal pressure from the United States . #% I will read the slightly amended wording of the first line carefully . #% We support the emphasis on qualitative value for money , the proposals on cost-benefit studies and agree that the Commission should be providing greater vision on economic reform . #% It is about time Parliament called the Commission to account , and I urge Members to vote to change the agenda to bring Mr Barroso here this very week . #% However , I would like to pursue one or two issues with him . #% It sets out quite clearly and pragmatically the intention to work with the Commission in the new culture which is very evident in the Commission to take the fight against fraud more seriously now than perhaps has historically been the case . #% It is essential that we all pull our weight in the three institutions concerned to make this institutional approach a reality . #% The Presidency in particular should have very red faces now , though I suspect not from sunburn . #% No doubt some Member States were being opportunistic in this respect , but the Commission had had three years to react to SIMAP ; its inaction could therefore lead to the neutering of a central piece of EU health and safety law . #% - The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report . #% 
Europe has to be driven by the moral imperatives which we face . #% But the European Council could , and in my view should , discuss the crisis today . #% We look forward with confidence to a very successful and very effective six months . #% Much of the process was kick-started and propelled by the declarations at the Lisbon Summit , but nothing would have happened if those declaratory statements had not been turned into excellent and workable proposals by the Commission . #% I believe that our constituents have a right to know not only what we pay ourselves , but also the details of the allowances and benefits that we receive . #% This was an issue over which the Committee on Transport was evenly split , with 20 votes each side , so it is perfectly right that Mrs Meissner has brought it here today for plenary to vote on . #% In many ways the European Union already exercises maximum powers in the area covered by my committee : we have codecision and qualified majority voting . #% We have a number of concerns which we have identified via our amendments . #% I call on the President of the Maldives to make sure that she , along with the rest of the detainees , is treated humanely and not subjected to torture . #% Does he specifically exclude any veterinary or pharmaceutical treatment of the disease , either where it occurs , or as a prophylaxis in areas which could in future be affected ? #% Again , many of our questions about how the overriding public interest will come into play in this have not been fully answered . #% We need to somehow get into being a policy which ends the practice of discards . #% Can I ask you to request the Bureau and the Quaestors to review their decision ? #% As Mrs Peijs ' report outlined , these types of contracts were discussed in committee pending this debate and , in essence , what we are seeking to do with the compromises proposed by Mrs Peijs is to ensure that parties can choose their own contract law in relation to these particular contracts , but not their own winding-up proceedings law . #% A recent survey found that 29 % of British adults now have access to the Internet . #% This is most important for us as a Budgets Committee , more important for the substantive committees , and it will be important for the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control when we come to look at the discharge later on . #% I welcome , as others have , his belief that a clear objective assessment should be made on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria . #% There are no witnesses , for the taxi driver ends up dead and you go straight to the first policeman you can find . #% With respect to maternity rights in the UK , all pregnant women are entitled to 18 weeks leave , which may begin up to 11 weeks before the birth of the child . #% The key aim of this proposal is to secure an EU-wide agreement to improve the conditions of maritime cargo transport operations concerning China and the EU . #% We , in the European Parliament , believe in competition as being good for the consumer in goods and services . #% The Legal Service points out that Article 11 of the Directive says that Member States ` may ' restrict equal treatment for third-country nationals in certain cases . #% Such openness should include the publication of minutes of its Governing Council with the reasoning behind decisions taken , particularly over interest rates . #% This particular issue is all the more urgent with the impending enlargement of the European Union and would include matters such as flight and duty time for cockpit and cabin crew . #% Croatian accession is the first crucial step . #% I would be very grateful if the Commissioner could perhaps give us further information on the checks she referred to that the Commission undertook in July , and whether there have been any subsequent checks by the Commission or by Euratom authorities subsequent to the French Government ordering a cessation of the cleaning process at Cap de la Hague . #% With regard to this particular instrument , we were concerned in terms of the budgetary principles of the EU budget and of budget discipline . #% The 10 new Member States are already eager to join , as they voted for in the separate and unanimously positive referenda before accession . #% Mr President , as Mr Lange has already said , we have made tremendous progress in reducing the emissions from road vehicles , by using better technology , using catalytic converters and lean-burn engines and by supplying better fuel - the ten parts per million diesel which Euro 4 would lay down . #% It was my intention to vote for it . #% Congestion charging plays a key role in combating congestion , pollution and global warming . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Coveney on his excellent report . #% I am now astounded that the religious practice of my research assistant and his friends in my office has apparently been subject to surveillance by the Belgian State . #% The agreement is concluded for a period of five years and shall be tacitly reviewed on an annual basis . #% The issue of detention is an extremely vexed subject , to put it mildly . #% Today , Parliament agreed that the Commission 's estimates of ACP needs of EUR 200 million must be met with new and fresh funding . #% The US needs to interrogate these individuals as it is an essential part of the worldwide struggle against terrorism . #% Madam President , I join with others in thanking the rapporteur for giving us an excellent basis for our debate on this very sensitive subject this morning . #% I also wonder how likely it is that the hardliners in the government will call for a severe crackdown on dissent in order to stamp it out once and for all . #% Let me , on behalf of my constituents , send my thanks to the emergency services -- firemen , the police and ambulance crews -- and indeed to local residents , who behaved , as you might imagine , with tremendous courage and dignity . #% I believe that is a practical and sensible approach , one which is showing signs of success and I urge the Presidency and the Commission to proceed on those lines . #% They are crucial to us for four reasons . #% Our resolution reiterates in paragraph 3 our basic expectations about the action that will follow ratification of the protocol . #% What is one supposed to make of the phrasing used to proclaim that one of the aims of the Marco Polo programme is to maintain the module repetition of freight transport at its 1998 levels by promoting a modal shift from road to other transport modes ? #% Mrs Montfort and my colleague from the EDD have spoken under quite unacceptable circumstances . #% But , after all , perhaps I can afford a smile . #% I understand that my amendment would have been passed had I put it to the vote . #% I would like to underline just one point : the importance of the EU policy towards the Ukraine . #% Mr President , this debate , looking at least at the great majority of contributions , has been very valuable . #% However , my concern is over how the rules will be interpreted by a partisan President of Parliament such as our current President , who does not seem to understand the concept of free speech and is very authoritarian in the way in which he deals with Members of the House . #% None of us here should have an interest in maintaining redundant legislation , nor in making legislation complicated rather than as easy as possible to understand and implement . #% I have to say I came back very angry and rather ashamed that the European Union should be represented in quite such a way , should be quite so ineffective in a crisis of extraordinary proportions . #% Our reasons for opposing this Commission are different . #% I therefore welcome the course that the rapporteur has taken with regard to subsidiary protection . #% What I say now is no reflection at all on the Commissioner himself , but I hope that he would accept with me that science must inform our decisions on risk and how to manage it . #% I thank Commissioner Liikanen for the initiatives that he has put forward . #% The new approach in my Amendment 66 , eliminates software claims and therefore the concerns they raise , but extends contributory infringement provisions that already apply within most Member States so as to cover imports from China , Russia or elsewhere . #% The Commission therefore hopes that the Russian authorities will respond to the present situation in a convincing way and it is vital that those authorities cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations in Europe and in the USA . #% We have spent EUR 180 million on the ridiculous pilgrimage to Strasbourg ; we have wasted EUR 60 million on the Committee of the Regions -- a talking shop that nobody listens to ; EUR 5 million have been nicked by corrupt officials in Eurostat . #% But it highlighted to me , in a simplified form , the problem that we are trying to address with this revision : as Commissioner Mandelson said , a revision that goes back some 20 years or more . #% Nevertheless , there is much in this report on which the Commission should reflect . #% One way of improving the situation is to pay reasonable wages to well-trained and qualified staff . #% There is clearly a pressing need for best practice to be spread evenly across the Union into every region and that best practice needs to be built around the European guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis . #% Exchanges are not public utilities and they should not be granted a monopoly . #% One area though is extremely important , and this House must be involved in it : namely scrutiny . #% The Commission must now act swiftly within the WTO to overturn these tariffs . #% 
First of all , I very much enjoyed working on the report with Manuel Medina . #% Mr Gusinsky 's media activities were the only ones permitted to criticise Mr Putin and his government . #% We must all become more competitive and abandon the economic ways of the past . #% Secondly , I very much welcome your announcement today that you wish to establish an interinstitutional working party . #% Any freedom of expression is essential to establishing the truth . #% If we have to adjourn and take up another subject , we should have an urgency debate on transport to Strasbourg ! #% The Committee on Petitions has asked the Ombudsman to report to us on the problems that citizens are presenting to him . #% We have 20 million residents who , by definition , are mobile . #% Later , while under house arrest , she joined the demonstration and was arrested again . #% The result will be that the European public service will have the best and most secure provision for safeguarding the interests of staff and the institutions and the European public of any public administration anywhere in the European Union . #% The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget ; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons ; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself , are now part of European folklore . #% The ability of the West to deal with the threat posed by Iran has been severely restricted by the war in Iraq , a war Britain entered into because of the lies and deceit of our Prime Minister , Mr Blair . #% The Israelis have not quite stopped holding checkpoints - 589 according to the Commission 's latest figures - which impose an economic embargo upon the Palestinians . #% Mr President , one of the issues we are supposed to be looking at is whether the European Union and our own Member States are the good guys in this . #% However , when the Commission cites the volume of justice and home affairs business being done in the European institutions and the regular appearance of such items on the European Council 's agenda as evidence of their vital importance , I fear the wrong benchmark has been chosen , for while justice and home affairs generates 30 % of translation work in the Council , it only produces 5 % of the decisions . #% Since putting this question down I realize that this problem is much more extensive than I had anticipated . #% A third criticism from the Council is that there is no chance whatsoever of spending the money this year . #% Mr President , this is one of the most illiberal and dishonest measures ever to come out of the EU , one with potentially enormous consequences . #% Every government in the world accepts the science and accepts that we are not doing enough to stop world temperatures rising by two degrees centigrade . #% In my own country -- which is not known for its support of anything that might even start to resemble a European contract code -- an independent survey by a big law firm highlighted the transactional costs of an incoherent contract law in the internal market . #% The problem was , they were hatched in Rome . #% However , Conservatives voted against this report as the issue was to make the Charter legally binding ( Justiciable ) across the whole Union , which we are wholly opposed to . #% If , after all , strategies formulated at regional and local level , such as in the Thames Valley , include this factor as an urgent priority , why does the Commission choose to leave it out ? #% Three objectives have been set out : firstly , to promote energy efficiency ; second , to increase the share of production of cleaner energy sources - the target is 12 % from renewables by 2010 - third , to reduce the environmental impact of the production and use of energy products . #% Success will very much depend on enterprises coming forward with their ideas , not those thrust upon them by regulation . #% I do not believe that they are consistent with the general framework that we hope to implement . #% This development in attitudes , which my colleague , Charles Tannock , knows a lot more about , and this move by the centre right are reflected in a quite modest and moderate EPP resolution and , indeed , in Simon Busuttil 's opening remarks . #% Certainly this resolution reflects the wish which I think is there in Parliament to lift the state of emergency and to ensure that civil society can proceed to full , fair , free elections with the support of the European Union , at any rate in its electoral monitoring capacity . #% Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised , I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement . #% I just want to insert a word of caution . #% If this goes through as proposed , to carry out the task that we have set down here , we will be appointing someone who is substantially higher graded and better paid than someone running a major Community institution such as the Trade Mark Protection Office in Alicante - a major autonomous institution . #% I also hope that everyone in this House will join me in expressing our profound hope that we have reached a turning point in the Middle East , and that we have reached a point where the path of peace and dialogue will start to displace that of the bomb and the bullet . #% This is not because we do not sympathise with many of the things contained therein but we felt that some things were in danger of overloading the agenda of this summit and might cause it to fail . #% Formal rights may well be given but they are unlikely to play out in the villages . #% We are looking with keen anticipation to you , Commissioner , to tell us how you think you are going to achieve that . #% Mr President , we are all grateful to Mr Zappal√† who has been our very own service provider on this important measure . #% Mr President , the lawful object of the Charter of Rights is to protect the legitimate rights , expectations and aspirations of the citizen against the oppressive behaviour of government , business or other citizens ; and it is , of course , right that people should be thus safeguarded in respect of the European institutions and their activities . #% I propose that we harmonise our English-language terminology with that of the Commission , which would make things clearer all around . #% Would the Finnish Presidency not agree that there are still a number of Council meetings to be held before the end of its Presidency and that it could use them as a very useful precedent for establishing its credentials in terms of openness - which at the moment , I am afraid , do not exist - by making sure at the very least that when press releases are published at the end of Council meetings , those press releases list exactly how each country voted on each issue on which there was a vote ? #% So I am all for social justice and social inclusion , but the biggest enemy of both is unemployment . #% 14 February is Valentine 's Day - a day for sharing messages between lovers . #% That is about making a political statement to get real action : not just to bring another regulation forward , but to start doing something . #% Briefly , I just want to mention and explain why the Liberal Group is seeking to remove the wording in paragraphs 83 and 84 which urges the Member States and the EU to ensure marriage is open to same-sex couples . #% Together with the agreements that we have reached on restricting the delegation of powers to the Commission - which I also had some concerns about - I am very pleased that first-reading agreement has been found with Council . #% Mr Crowley 's report restores that flexibility to Parliament , to the Conference of Presidents and to the relevant committees and I welcome it on that account . #% After these hearings its first grey hairs are appearing , and in a few months time the √©minences grises of Parliament will begin their historic task of entering into regular dialogue with the ECB . #% At a meeting in Parliament earlier today , the Commissioner reminded Members that EUR 1 billion had been set aside to start projects and she informed us that the Council had blocked the spending of this money . #% Mr President , we are often placed in a dilemma when dealing with evil and repugnant regimes . #% Evidence of complicity by the Colombian armed forces is that the military had forced him to sign a statement absolving them of responsibility for his safety . #% An unstable world to our east and south demands special actions . #% Let me explain that for everyone 's benefit . #% This is a valuable new development in which we are involved and which we are debating . #% We have cooperated closely with the other institutions to complete it all in one reading . #% When it was privatised , it experienced a traumatic time with the loss of plants and jobs , and morale was at rock bottom . #% He is the messenger for a presidency that has run out of ideas , run out of steam and is rapidly running out of time . #% We are aware that this is something which is very controversial in this House but at long last we are beginning to recognise that the nuclear family is not the only model which is applicable . #% I have this morning written to President Borrell , drawing his attention to the disgraceful incidents that took place last night and on Tuesday night in football matches between England and Spain , where there was racist abuse of black English players . #% But if you voted on this then I will not put the question . #% It is also important in my view to take all reasonable steps to prohibit minors from gaming online . #% Let me take you back to an Arctic night in January 1968 , still the era of the Cold War - indeed the facts of this story sound like an international thriller . #% But we may have seen nothing yet , because we are moving into an era of new legislation - the era of co-regulation . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , what is the best way of increasing living standards and human and civil rights in Central American and the Andean Community countries ? #% Come and watch some cricket and , again , meet some real people ! #% I hope the Commissioner can produce that for us . #% Company law still needs to be made a pan-European fact of life . #% Mr President , I want to sympathise with you as I assume that , because of the time of day , you also encountered the problem that I and a number of other colleagues experienced in trying to get to this vote this afternoon . #% 
Mr President , coming from a tourist area myself , one of the things I want to emphasize is that although tourism can be of great importance to the local economy , particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises , it has to be carried out in the right way . #% I am pleased that almost all legislative proposals under the Small Business Act have been adopted but urge Member States to implement the revised Late Payments Directive without delay . #% But it must be said that , as yet , not one single British ski instructor has been allowed to work in the French Alps . #% It is important that this is carried out primarily through organizations actually composed of , and run by , disabled people rather than just those organizations which purport to act on behalf of disabled people . #% Mr President , in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence , coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States . #% I think we have a problem with interpretation , with all due respect to Mr Grosch . #% What is happening now is that the top shelf at the newsagent 's is being brought into our children 's bedrooms . #% I would add to that list Ukraine . #% That question fell because of lack of time to ask it , as was the case with 105 out of 120 questions tabled by Members so far this month . #% They also agree that on the important issue of minimum or maximum harmonisation we should be looking sensibly at a case-by-case basis . #% Mr Rocard also makes it very clear that the best solution is for the options currently on offer to be improved so that the ACP can be provided with real choices when any WTO waiver covering the current trade options expires . #% Finally , I believe that there is a great deal of merit in Amendment No 5 . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , it says this is a contribution , but it is more like a recipe , a recipe for the harmonisation of yet more taxation , which I quote here and there from the report : '27 different tax systems ' are an ` impediment ' ; ` coordination of Member States ' fiscal policy ' ; ` calls on the Member States to ... ensure greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden ' ; ` supports ' the Commission in gearing ` fiscal policy towards ... environmental objectives ' ; ` increase in fuel taxes ' ; ` establish a pan-European ... corporate tax base ' . #% The EU Member States must also accept , within reason , more refugees on a temporary basis . #% We felt that the initial proposal was amended out of sight by the rapporteur and she put in her proposal that the European public prosecutor would lead to Corpus Juris . #% Madam President , I should like to express the Socialist Group 's deep concern about the growing phenomenon of fundamentalist terrorism , not only in India but all around the world . #% Let us do better in the future . #% I hope that you will decide to take decisions by majority voting , both because this would lead to more efficient decision-making and because you are asked to do so in the Treaties . #% I am sorry to say that there are some similarities with the situation concerning Zimbabwe . #% Finally , in the response to paragraphs 19.28 to 19.36 the Commission makes a statement which I seem to have seen now for the third time . #% The only oil on them is the oil you would find in the tanks that fuel them -- they are not petrol tankers . #% Let us remember , above all , that what we must do as politicians is to let the market work . #% We must , for example , be prepared to consider very quickly the introduction of technology transfer to developing countries to ensure that they do not present a new series of CO2 emissions that can not be controlled . #% Will it divert the currently under-funded public services from real emergencies ? #% We need strategic lift . #% The UK Independence Party will vote against the resolution and its amendments , which will damage the interests of British sugar producers . #% I know others have mentioned this , but I would not like it to be thought , if this report is passed , that we want to work towards a one-size-fits-all European social model , instead of respecting the diversity that we have at the moment . #% However , we urge that the report must not be used as a lever to try and harmonise social security benefits across the EU : this has to remain a Member State competence . #% It is prejudiced against the British working fleet and it will now ruin sea angling in Britain if we give this man , and people of his ilk , power . #% Commissioner , would the Commission be able to confirm when this process will begin ? #% This proposed directive is a landmark for Europe . #% The more the single market develops and the more the proportion of cross-border trade develops , the need for consumer protection will also increase . #% One thing I would like to comment on are the obvious problems that we are finding with the economic and political developments in Germany and France . #% That is not fully reflected in the resolution as it stands . #% It is the challenge we must confront at the beginning of the new century . #% You can not embrace globalisation while abandoning large numbers of our citizens . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work on the organisation of working time . #% Suspension of ` use it or lose it ' will not affect London Heathrow , Frankfurt , Paris Charles de Gaulle or Amsterdam Schiphol , but it will affect regional airports serving those hubs , because it is those routes the airlines will suspend . #% Thirdly , it should aim to upgrade the combating of climate change to establish a good context for the reform of the common agricultural policy and the construction of a common energy policy . #% Here we are almost at the end of 2002 before we finally have a revised text . #% This should be the objective , not discussing the feasibility of another WTO waiver , although I appreciate that the Commission is continuing to focus on reaching the deadlines . #% There is an imbalance in the Administration and I would like to be sure that the Administration is seen from the outside as being effective and politically balanced . #% We have improved the comitology proposals , we have improved the proposals relating to craft built for own use . #% It is just a question about airline operators . #% New tasks are continually being delegated to these agencies and it is vital that they are adequately resourced . #% Does the President-in-Office accept that the ` oil for food ' programme , while commendable , has many bureaucratic shortcomings and accompanying sanctions which still stop the needs of children from being met , while their parents can do very little to get rid of the inhuman dictatorship of Saddam Hussein . #% The first three may well be self-explanatory . #% It is good to see that not all of Britain 's traditions and institutions are under threat from Brussels . #% Thirdly , it seeks the close involvement of regional advisory councils . #% It was unnecessary and took the shine off it . #% A theme that my group has consistently pushed for , for many years now . #% There are huge gaps in the budgetary promises that have been made . #% Madam President , I want to address the section on the CFSP . #% For this , I personally thank him . #% Let us show tomorrow that we want it and are going to vote for it too . #% The current systems of air traffic control in Europe are living on borrowed time and the tragic events this summer only go to prove that . #% We have not taken part in the debate and we will not take part in the vote . #% For example , to counter terrorism threats we need to collaborate with those who have the right skills and can help . #% Hiving it off to the private sector will be less effective in terms of meeting people 's needs and also inefficient in purely financial terms - it is more costly . #% Indeed , the final text before us has been the result of a lot of work by many people . #% Finally , let us all make it clear that if we adopt this report tomorrow we are not forcing Member State or local authority to charge motorists or hauliers . #% What more can any of us say ? #% I am told that in the United Kingdom between 1989 and 2005 , GBP 26 billion will be spent on upgrading the water system to deal with this directive . #% It is also vital to preserve the existing zero rates in Member States . #% You only have to look at the immense discrepancy in the cost of water to communities across the European Union to see that something needs to be done about it . #% Many localities and regions have excellent ideas , and that knowledge and information must be disseminated throughout the European Union . #% 
However , even if India did develop nuclear energy it would meet only 2 % of total energy requirements . #% One was the scope , where we found a happy and acceptable solution , and the other was the board , where there was some controversy . #% However , there remains a great deal still to be done to allay the growing concerns amongst citizens across the European Union about the emergence of strains of bacteria resistant to most antibiotics due to overuse both for animals and human beings . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the report describes itself , and I quote , as ` essentially a technical exercise without major political implications ' . #% I would like to congratulate the questioner . #% Even when we have been invited by national parliaments to present our assessment of the Constitution , they have written to them and complained that we have accepted such invitations . #% He talked about the events in Egypt and elsewhere , saying that it is wonderful that people are rising up seeking democracy . #% This is also keeping a ratio between commitments and payments below 80 % in most cases . #% However , we do have a number of problems with the resolution , ranging from our opposition to the Treaty of Nice as a prerequisite of enlargement to rejection of a common asylum and immigration policy , which we believe is a prerogative of the Member States , although we strongly favour bilateral cooperation designed to safeguard the integrity of our borders . #% The position we agreed was that yes , we as a Parliament , are willing - with the Council - to delegate such implementing powers , provided that we have the opportunity to call them back where necessary . #% On the common foreign and security policy , we need greater clarity : we are not clear on who does what . #% That is the importance of third generation . #% Do not place the EFSA in any building or venue that has close connections with the institutions of the European Union . #% Well , of course , the answer is Ireland and the Lisbon Treaty . #% However , we can not support the reference in this report for all migrant children to be taught in their mother tongue . #% The Presidency has a thankless task in trying to reach an agreement in Council on the financial perspectives . #% However , when probed about the EU-Israel Association Agreement , despite Israel 's catalogue of defiance of Security Council resolutions and blatant disregard of the International Court of Justice , as she continues to annex East Jerusalem and deny the Palestinian people the right to self-determination , what is the EU 's response ? #% It appears that the limit set by the directive would restrict a truck driver to six hours work , a tractor driver to two or three hours and a brush cutter to 15 minutes . #% Hopes of further talks have been damaged by the Council proscribing the LTTE as a terrorist organisation on 29 May 2006 . #% So the first point I make is , please , can we ensure that the Council does not adopt in detail this proposal at its next meeting in June , because it is not ready to be adopted ? #% I suggest that perhaps the person whose fingerprints are really on this is not here to answer that tonight . #% There have been well-publicised cases recently in the United Kingdom about the British forces . #% It is precisely to ensure that we can improve the position as regards certainty and clarity that we are seeking its incorporation . #% There are already international structures - the International Maritime Organisation ( IMO ) rules , the International Law of the Sea - but there is a need for something more tailored and more specific . #% We are sure the Member States will note the emphatic majority expressed here . #% We need balanced progress in the internal market , in competition policy and in social policy , but again I do not see much evidence of that in the Commission 's work programme . #% I have sat in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with him for the last year or so and I have heard him make the same speech time after time about de-regulation and too much bureaucracy at European level . #% The Commission must therefore be capable of achieving the highest standards of executive and administrative performance in the discharge of its powers and duties in order to facilitate that massive and welcome development . #% The third-party access guidelines in the Annex have been agreed by Member States , regulators , TSOs and system users . #% For too long coal has been seen as a dirty fuel and scant regard has been given to the possibility of cleaning up coal by use of new technologies . #% Secondly , we wish to change the Treaty revision procedure in those areas where power is already transferred to the European level . #% I would like her to tell me how her position on this directive and those findings square with the report from the Commission and the report that has just come out and which states that ` without additional efforts , the Union looks set to miss its employment rate target for 2005 ' . #% However , we must caution against further changes to the proposed EU constitution ; changes which in our view will not realistically help to achieve our aims . #% They will have until 2003 to do that , but it is a challenge for them and it is a challenge , I hope , that they can rise to . #% 80 % of the budget , as we all know , is spent by the Member State and the incidence of fraud in the Member State is at least as serious as the incidence of fraud in that money which is organized and spent collectively at the centre of the Union in Brussels . #% It is not really in order with our normal procedure . #% Of course that was a disaster , but when we are thinking about general rules against general problems , we must not be too specific . #% What happens in the future when we have a problem in our economy and where there is a serious external shock or a serious internal shock and you have to talk to the social partners and the other economic actors about some perhaps unpalatable measures that need to be taken at a European level ? #% I have to say , however , and it is not her fault , that there are sins of omission as far as I am concerned . #% The jammy dodger is a fine British institution and many in the UK had feared that the directive would result in the outlawing of this biscuit . #% I think that there is a role for the joint parliamentary committees in monitoring programmes such as MEDIA II and other Community programmes where the pre-accession countries are already participating . #% However , we have abstained on this report today because we do not support the principle of arbitrary quotas of men or women in any sphere , including what is suggested in this report . #% Basically , that reaction leads to the position of Mr Lannoye , which really is that he does not want any sweeteners authorised at all at any level and would like them all taken off the market . #% That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide . #% However , failing that , Parliament must reserve its right to have the fullest inquiry into this lamentable case . #% I welcome the opportunity to come back to an oft-repeated subject . #% I would like to concentrate my remarks on the issue of soft law and Mr Medina Ortega 's report . #% The Thai authorities have been found wanting in international compliance . #% Is it that when tasted blind with French wines and others , English wines come out on top for taste , thus our competitors are simply jealous ? #% Mr President , we clearly have a very serious problem with marine life and possible links with naval sonar . #% Nature , by definition , can not be standardised , nor can real human lives , which is why UKIP opposes the dead hand of the EU wherever its grip extends . #% deputising for the rapporteur . - Mr President , I should like to begin by giving the apologies of the rapporteur , Mr Leinen , who could not be here tonight because he has to represent Parliament in a far-away part of the world . #% Does that apply to other public sector organisations ? #% We now have a compromise . #% As I have already informed you by letter , the question arises because members of the Labour Party in this House were issued with what was called a ` code of practice ' which sought to determine their behaviour in ways which seemed to be in conflict with Parliament 's rules . #% Market access is a key issue . #% Finally , I want to return to the obligations of the wider maritime industry to get their act together . #% What is territorial cohesion ? #% Even chess and the flying of kites have been banned as un-Islamic , though there are many Islamic scholars who would contest such interpretations of the Koran . #% You will note from Mrs McIntosh that exasperation is rife , I have to say , on this particular issue . #% Finally , I think this really does point to the acute need to look at how the WTO works and to transform it into a properly democratic body whose proceedings are transparent and whose members are accountable . #% To do that there is a series of specific compromises : 16 new amendments which broadly find favour with the Commission - I hope Mr Byrne will be able to indicate that - and the Council . #% Cooperation , communication between the ombudsman and the Petitions Committee , is also very important if we are to protect more fully our citizens ' rights . #% Firstly , we need to have a much sounder basis for the requirement for a proportionality check , so that minor offences are not covered . #% It is a challenge to all of us - Parliament , the Commission and the Council - to put in place those safeguards , because it is difficult to keep on agreeing until we have them . #% You may have got away with it on previous policies , but on the question of immigration you will not . #% 
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today 's agenda . #% A large part of consumer transactions from Europe on the Web is directed at American sites and in future may well be directed at Asian sites . #% Poverty leads to ill-health and ill-health means poverty for nations , families and individuals . #% The EU must ensure that the benefits of our trading relationship are shared with Indians -- all of them . #% I understand that my speech leaked out to the rest of the Members of Parliament beforehand , hence their disappearance in mass numbers . #% First , I apologise if you feel that I have abused the Rules of the House . #% Those clients had reasons to be thankful for the existence of this rather unknown organisation . #% I am not an expert in marketing ; I know there are no simple solutions ; I certainly know more propaganda leaflets are not the answer . #% We need a decision from the Council of Ministers so that farmers can plan for the future . #% Regrettably perhaps , sometimes the carrot of amnesty is the only way of guaranteeing a lasting peace . #% This will put this category of former Members in the same position as staff with the same length of service . #% But we demand more than that . #% All the crossings , whether they are legal or illegal , will be used by terrorists , smugglers , immigrants , criminals and so on . #% Press reports since then , concerning attempts at compliance , have presented conflicting information . #% We should be preparing urgently for enlargement by solving the Amsterdam leftovers , and reforming the CAP and the structural funds representing 80 % of the budget of the EU , not preparing for grand constitutional reform of little relevance to the concerns and aspirations of the electorate . #% You said the text would be aligned but I am not sure with what . #% We are correct to stress the existing impediments to freedom of expression , but we should not put up spurious blocks to the continuation of the process that we have started . #% We look forward to that initiative appearing at the Seville summit . #% How representative will the Convention be of the peoples of Europe ? #% We believe this makes it much more difficult for this Parliament and my committee to scrutinise the budget adequately and rigorously . #% To conclude , while I welcome the fact that South Africa has won a share of significant European markets , I hope we can also learn from the lessons of this agreement and ensure that in future the timing , phasing and scope of free-trade arrangements will reflect more closely the different needs of the participating countries . #% My final point concerns our engagement as parliamentarians . #% It is true that we lack the monitoring mechanisms to connect the obligation to the powers and that needs to be filled in . #% As the questioner pointed out , music performers have a very strong union which over the years has been able to protect their position . #% Madam President , Mr Moorhouse has made a statement which is about the most offensive statement that can ever be made about a fellow parliamentarian . #% Of course Slovenia must not itself assume that membership of the European Union will stem automatically from this agreement . #% From the point of view of the ordinary citizens of Europe , however , I would suggest that the notion of the victim of a crime is a very simple one . #% Also , in relation to the WTO , I notice the report lays great stress on the fact that the United States makes a major contribution to domestic aeronautical research . #% A country which had the right to import shirts but not piece-good textiles got round the rules by importing shirts with tails 15 metres long - and they got away with it . #% The flasks were unsafe and inadequately tested . #% For example , cassava is a staple food for many people , not a minor substance . #% How much are they looking at ethical investment which might then deal with issues such as quality of work , keeping older people in the workforce , training and a whole raft of measures at the same time as dealing with the pensions question itself ? #% It is this kind of information that , in my opinion , people are getting slightly wrong . #% Private sector estimates put the increase in the return on savings that could result from using the prudent investment principle at up to 3 % . #% The Commissioner referred to the disadvantages of duty-free and he cited a number of areas where be believed there was a negative impact on , for example , the retail sector and the transport sector . #% When the Commissioner says that we are using all the instruments at our disposal to get the Israelis to observe international agreements and obey the law , I do not think that can possibly be the case . #% Can I be assured that if we can not keep order in the streets of Brussels , we can at least keep order inside the Parliament building ? #% I should like to underline what Commission Schreyer referred to this afternoon , which is not often mentioned : we have a budget , a very strictly managed budget . #% That would mean distinguishing between the sale of arms to countries that would use them to abuse human rights and the sale of arms to countries that may have a dubious record but , nonetheless , have a legitimate external security concern . #% Sir Robert was stating that the British Government may well be acting and in breach of Community law as regards a breach of confidence . #% It also rejects the contrary view : the idea that free trade should prevail at all costs ; that the WTO should be an agent for the dismantling of outstanding trade barriers , and should do so to the exclusion of all other political and public policy considerations . #% I would much rather use this summit meeting as a historic opportunity to look at the whole question of employability and how we can boost employability in the European Union . #% Mr President , this report was also voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure which allows for no debate and no amendments to the report . #% However , our new Prime Minister , Mr Cameron , can solve such problems at a stroke as I described here yesterday . #% This approach flies in the face of reality . #% Some of the versions of this report in themselves have been contradictory in the dates that they gave . #% It is a Christmas tree on which we have hung our wish list of expensive baubles . #% Now , it is not the post-Nice debate but the debate on Europe 's future . #% The UK delegation of the EPP-ED reserves its position on paragraph 35 , which calls for Article 151 to be changed to operate under qualified majority rule . #% Could we not perhaps have had one clear , simple report ? #% We should be supporting Amnesty International 's Day of Action tomorrow to remember the political prisoners held in Pakistan , and we certainly need to be looking at aid and the way in which it is spent . #% On behalf of the ELDR Group , I congratulate her on her work and commend the report to the House . #% I would like to thank my colleague , Mrs Ludford , for tabling this question . #% Within the notion of a space to think , that will not be official . #% The Commissioner rightly said that we need to get women out of the recession and back working . #% I have worked on the e-commerce directive , the copyright directive and we are working on the electronic communications bills . #% Other leading opposition figures such as Budiman and Bintang Pamungkas and trade union leaders like Dita Sari and Muchtar Pakpahan are serving long jail sentences under the Draconian anti-subversion law . #% I hope it will go further and accept our call for a comprehensive directive on workplace ergonomics . #% I echo Mr Gargani in saying that all of the issues that have been discussed around the Chamber tonight seek to ensure that culture is seen as a priority ; that it is not just , for instance , the euro or jobs and employment that will bring a successful European project together . #% That figure was not known at the time when the directive was brought through - not in my country and not in any country ; so the question is : can we obtain better , more effective impact assessments ? #% That is why a series of amendments , most notably Nos 9 and 15 , seek to include cider and perry on the standard list with wines , spirits and beers . #% Mr President , there has been some interest in my commitment to Austria . #% Turning to the question to the Commission , I should like to acknowledge from the outset the high level of cooperation and the positive response to our concerns that we have received from Commissioner Piebalgs . #% Furthermore , Mr Howitt claimed I disregarded the plight of Turkish civilian victims . #% We still do not have a full calling to account . #% Parliament felt that the way to deal with this was to take what was originally a recommendation on environmental inspections and use it as a way of enforcing common standards throughout the Member States by upgrading it to a directive which Member States would , we had hoped , want to take more notice of . #% 
If national governments attempt to pass this without consulting the people , it will be a constitutional abomination . #% For example , we do not share the enthusiasm for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% Mr President , as Mr Macartney has just indicated , there are a number of problems in the former Yugoslavia which concern us at the moment but perhaps the most symbolic has to be the situation in Mostar . #% We therefore abstained on this resolution . #% We are now committed to Romania and Bulgaria . #% It addresses the deep frustrations that businesses , particularly small enterprises , have faced in exercising their rights under the single market . #% There has to be , even with the precautionary principle , a substantial link between the assessment of risk and action by the European Union . #% It is appropriate for all central monetary authorities to maintain a vigilant approach to hedge funds . #% There are many examples of that being developed in areas of social exclusion in the world ' s poorer countries at the moment , from which we can learn . #% We had a feeling that the completion of the essential foundation of the EU 2020 strategy for smart growth and jobs and innovation - the Single Market - was not really reflected as a political priority . #% I regret that it has taken until now to get a communication on this issue . #% They were not listening to Mr Martinez earlier on . #% Mr President , the Spring Council will no doubt be dominated by the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda . #% in writing . - I voted to close the accounts for the European Police College as I believe it is important to draw a line under the discharge procedure for 2008 . #% When looking at the developing world , we have to remember that tourism plays more of a role in some regions and countries than in others ; the figures in the report show that . #% It just means that we need to keep negotiations open . #% Mr President , on 9 June 2004 the College of the Commission decided to dismiss 43 language teachers with almost immediate effect . #% We must make sure that area of research forms part of the programme . #% As Mr Kellett-Bowman points out in that report , a single report is a wonderful idea ; themes can be developed across the agencies and horizontal issues can be compared between the agencies themselves . #% However , the rapporteur has gone in precisely the opposite direction , proposing extension of the scope of the framework directive , new legislation on workplace bullying , a new directive on workplace ergonomics , strengthening of the display screen equipment directive and amendment of the manual handling directive . #% But what do we find here ? #% In the United Kingdom , we have already derogated from Article 5 . #% But I believe by working together openly with the common goal of raising the quality of life for the whole world , we can actually confound the critics of globalisation and show that globalisation and liberalisation can genuinely be a decisive force for good . #% We certainly need effective systems of monitoring and evaluation and last , but by no means least , a Community budget . #% No preference on gender grounds was shown towards a man . #% They are good as far as they go , but they do not go far enough , and they have to be obligatory rather than voluntary . #% If there are serious allegations against persons for connections with terrorism they should be charged , but the party itself should be saved for parliamentary democracy . #% I have to say I do not see the same positive approach on the part of the Burmese authorities . #% It is vital , if we are to have a truly sustainable transport policy that this process is reversed . #% I have been very critical of the way the British press has been talking about our partners in Europe in recent weeks . #% We feel that the higher amount of funding proposed is essential if we are to be able to do serious work in tackling social exclusion and poverty . #% What will be the role of national parliaments in this whole new environment ? #% The large amount of cost and inconvenience that would be involved for users to produce even smaller fractional improvements in environmental performance would be very difficult to justify . #% The points that I made in my earlier response related to the natural concentrations of uranium in sea-water of all descriptions and in all locations . #% I would be grateful if he would take us into his confidence along the way so that the committee which has been working very hard can be involved and not have a confrontation about the amendments which are being brought forward . #% That means that the industry must demonstrate to the regulator that it fully understands the hazards associated with its operations and knows how to control them . #% It is becoming ever clearer that the response must be measured and proportionate , and the consequences for all must be anticipated and planned . #% At the end of the day , what is important is that the people of Bulgaria should have confidence in their administration and justice system . #% in writing . - The European Council must turn its attention to Burma , where the situation on the ground remains dire . #% Therefore , many of the tools that we have gradually developed need further refinement , whether life-cycle analysis or some of the other tools . #% The Commission and Council should reflect the impressive cross-party consensus that we have created in Parliament . #% In particular , I am looking to the Council and the Commission , working on the development of the policy planning unit that is an essential part of the Amsterdam Treaty , to ensure there is an effective human rights dimension and conflict prevention dimension in the work of that unit . #% We do not want a European army and we certainly to not want a European police force . #% But if commitment and the strong and active dedication of members of the current College is anything to go by we will achieve success in all respects . #% Indeed , you should rest assured that many in this House support you in this move even if some would perhaps suggest quite the opposite . #% Making up part of the EU 's 2020 strategy , this report outlines 15 ` cornerstones ' of a strong policy which will ensure that the EU can keep up with competitors from the US , China and Japan , who invest heavily in research and development into cutting-edge technology , and countries that are able to cut costs through cheap labour and have less stringent intellectual property rules . #% I therefore have to ask the House to reject those two amendments . #% Each nation 's needs are different and it is about time the EU took that on board . #% It would also apply to the draft legislative resolution and would read : `` The proposal was not foreseen in the financial perspective . #% On the comment that Mr Brinkhorst makes on the question of the decentralised agencies - which Mr Kellett-Bowman has picked up - it is essential that the Council address that question , which both Parliament and the Commission have agreement on . #% Taking EUR 1billion from payments , once again , is just a burden for the future . #% That I think shows that the Parliament , when addressing questions such as these and human rights issues in general , can play a responsible and effective role . #% From my experiences there , I now believe that the uncontrolled movement of people in global terms over the next 20 to 30 years , whether it be based on economic issues or climatic issues , represents a massive challenge to good order and democracy . #% Tragically , only yesterday 34 Hindus were killed by an Islamic terrorist bomb attack on a Hindu temple in Gujarat . #% But blanket controls imposed on every country by Brussels will limit the freedom of Member States to decide the approach most appropriate for them . #% What we need is a genuine single market in defence . #% I am very concerned that , on the labelling of fragrances , aromas and essential oils , Amendments Nos 21 and 28 involve the introduction of unnecessary requirements which may have a very unfortunate effect on the composition of products , their continued availability and indeed the viability of some of the smaller firms that make them . #% As a Member of this House back in the mid-80s , when Japan played out the role that China is playing today , I saw the wrong steps being taken . #% If we were debating that EPA today , we would have to enter our reservations regarding Madagascar . #% In my view these hearings were flawed because there was insufficient time available to the committees to pursue their lines of questioning . #% Perhaps it would be interesting to look at a country outside the EU - Switzerland - in terms of energy policy . #% I was quite shocked to receive the letter to say that ashtrays will be put outside the Chamber , along with no smoking signs , because you have always been helpful in the past on this matter of smoking in this building . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to just take an opportunity to clear up one or two questions which have arisen , although it is a pity that some of those asking the questions are not around for the answers . #% Lukashenko would ideally like to build an eastern pan-Slavic bloc hostile to the West . #% I will support that . #% Many people , myself included , were unhappy about the unreasonably high salary of the supervisor , which will of course be comparable to that of the Ombudsman . #% 
In supporting the reports before us now , I hope that we shall all pledge ourselves to continue and further enhance our work on human rights , which is in the interests of all humanity . #% Even worse is that many of his people are rotting as political prisoners in re-education camps where they are being tortured and beaten . #% Clearly we are getting something wrong and we need to get that put right . #% The question to which my committee failed to receive a satisfactory answer from the Commission , was why do we allow such a situation to develop in the first place ? #% The traditional assumption that the EU and US will keep leading in knowledge-intensive industries , while developing countries will somehow just be left to focus on the lower-skilled areas , is rightly being seriously contested . #% At what point do we say enough is enough ? #% The EU 's role in offering refugees protection has been under assault from some governments , notably the UK . #% However , there are species both in South America and in Africa that can be managed and could form the basis of an organised trade , with the appropriate safeguards . #% in writing . - I feel that this resolution was a knee-jerk reaction to the tragic situation in Japan , and did not allow enough time for debate of the issues surrounding the safety of nuclear power plants in the EU . #% Here it seems clear the European Union is making things worse . #% We need improved access for European Union monitors to make sure that the aid is being distributed properly . #% It is the Member States who must determine what our treatment of gays and lesbians in relationships must be . #% The Lord Mayor of Leicester , Councillor John Allen and the Lady Mayoress , Mrs Allan , are in the public gallery . #% Now is the time for us as a Parliament , the Commission and the Council to work together to ensure that key is turned . #% I should like to raise a note of caution here . #% This is a bad attitude for life , and definitely a bad attitude for work , but these attitudes can be dismantled and reassembled in a progressive and positive way to stop the kind of problems we face at work . #% Romania 's control of its borders and collection of customs dues -- with the settlement of the Snake Island dispute in the Black Sea -- is important , as is improving food hygiene , environmental pollution and intellectual property protection . #% Our leaders pledged to make the European Union the most dynamic , knowledge-based economy in the world , with more and better quality jobs and greater social cohesion . #% NATO 's SFOR was criticised by Amnesty International for human rights violations . #% The abolition of the current restrictions will enable transport companies to optimize the management of their activities and the profitability of their vehicle fleets . #% I myself was the rapporteur for the Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia in 1990 that reiterated that demand . #% The best memorial for those innocent people who died so tragically last week is to take action to prevent its repetition . #% In the last year , as interest rates have been raised from their historic low , the ECB has been under political attack , and an attempt was made to use this report to interfere in its management . #% I am pleased to say that other committees , such as the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , which has a lot of experience with comitology , and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which has begun to deal with the Lamfalussy procedures , fully support the approach that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has taken on this . #% This will be the legacy of this United States Administration unless they are prepared to look again . #% It has already been referred to - and I think this , for us , is the big breakthrough - that , rather than this interinstitutional body that meets as and when , and two to three years apart , we have set ourselves six months to meet again and a much more regular timetable . #% These positions were not staked out by any single government either at the beginning or end of the Convention , or at the beginning of the IGC . #% Other speakers have referred in glowing terms - and rightly so - to the value of the Erasmus exchanges and the school networking which these programmes provide . #% For 12 years I have made the same speech - I did not do it last year - saying that this is a budget for the Council ' s first reading made by Coreper and the politicians have no input into it . #% Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers . #% Although I am sure I would not like a blood bag used for a transfusion I am getting , or a piece of pipe that has been put in my body , to contain poisons , similarly , I would not want a product which did not perform as well to be used in that application . #% I think it is much more sensible that everybody has a role to play . #% We now see words being turned into action , with an emissions trading scheme which may well prove the basis for meeting up to 50 % of the reductions we have pledged to achieve . #% Mr President , I just wanted to welcome Sir James Goldsmith to the Chamber on one of his rare visits to Parliament . #% I would like to hear from the Commission if it is with us emphatically express the view that Parliament has expressed and the Committee on Culture has expressed in this matter , not just over the past months , but over years , whatever the temporary blockage in the Council may be . #% On the basis of the letter from Commissioner Patten , could I ask you to consider the vote on the SAB 4 as an urgency , so that we can adopt it during this part-session ? #% For a start we have a Convention - and I am particularly pleased at this because I think I was the first one to suggest nearly two years ago now , that the Convention method that was used for drafting the Charter of Rights could equally be used to prepare a revision of the Treaties . #% It will not be confined simply to the transmission of surveillance data . #% However , it is essential that a budget ceiling is put in place for the EU 's contributions ; that Member States hosting the schools give a greater contribution towards the local costs ; that there is a realistic contribution from parents of Category III children . #% We are only dealing with it at European level now , but hopefully the world will react , whether it be through the auspices of the United Nations once more or , indeed , through the common sense of other countries . #% President -- in -- Office , what are you proposing to do about improving trust between these agencies ? #% For the wider issue , in terms of the health debate in the European Parliament and measures the Commission is taking to combat tobacco consumption , on which I hope there will be further progress in the Commission tomorrow , there is progress in Member States such as Great Britain , where proposals have been produced by the government to tackle smuggling as a priority . #% I was wondering if you could perhaps expand on what the implications of GATS might be on utilities which have already been privatised . #% In Britain the Liberal Democrats have pledged to reach the 0.7 % by 2011 , two years ahead of the deadline set by the present UK Government . #% There are one or two areas where perhaps there will be difficulties regarding interinstitutional cooperation , not least as regards early retirement . #% But we would ask that when there is space our assistants should be allowed access : it is not always convenient for them to be in our offices if we have visitors . #% Also , when looking at our previous aviation security legislation , we see that problems have developed , especially in the context of implementation . #% It has already signed a legal cooperation agreement with the US , so the Americans can not dispute the Council 's legal status . #% But , if the recommendation does not have a positive impact , then we will all collectively need to come back together to reconsider the legal bases that are available to us and maybe take the route suggested in Mr P√©rez √Ålvarez 's Amendments Nos 7 and 22 . #% Therefore we could put it under a motion for debate at some point in the future . #% Finally , in pointing out some of the practical challenges that lie ahead , I would not and do not want to denigrate the huge achievement of the negotiation and signing of the agreement in the first place . #% In future , the ELDR will therefore insist that there is clear justification for , and specialised parliamentary debate on , all measures announced in the work programme . #% The role of Prime Minister Blair , as a close friend of President Bush , who is tough on Cuba , is a bit of a mystery , unless it is some shabby deal cut over Gibraltar , which is thankfully off the agenda in Madrid right now . #% Why then is this draft worth supporting ? #% I do not wish to delay the House long , but I have to raise this point because it is a serious matter . #% I would also like to thank the President-in-Office for being here . #% One of the colleagues here today told me that Alan is known quite simply as someone who brings stories to life . #% I come from a region where we have a traditional industry , the ceramics industry , that is facing this kind of pressure . #% Their fundamental objection is to the amendments which seek to use this proposal as a vehicle for establishing a `` European Public Security Force '' . #% This is a separate issue . #% The Council representative said that we support steps to sustainable democracy - and of course we do . #% Only this weekend we have seen in London the down-side of the communications and information revolution that the Web has created by putting elements in society in touch with one another , who have then wrought violence on the streets of London . #% Nevertheless , we should congratulate the Chinese authorities on cooperating with an international organisation , the WHO , in its investigations into the specific characteristics of the disease and the particular modes of transmission . #% in writing . - I welcome today 's resolution , which highlights progress in negotiations for an EU trade agreement with Canada . #% At some point we must say no . #% Many small films , and not so much in the English-speaking world but certainly in the smaller countries of Europe , simply do not get off the ground in spite of the immense cultural impact they would have because of the difficulty of financing . #% 
I was deeply impressed by the way that the incoming Chief Justice dealt with those competences and his relationship with the United States Constitution . #% While the lack of health workers is of particular urgency , the overall task is to improve all these aspects simultaneously . #% However , I hope that even if that does take place , we will show by the mid-term review that we are getting excellent value for money and that the budget should be raised in future years . #% It has , however , doubts as to whether fishing effort control should be the sole management tool and therefore also has doubts about Amendments Nos 11 and 14 . #% A vote for this report is effectively a vote to subsidise murder and it creates the very conditions in which terrorism is spawned . #% This , as Mr MacCormick very lucidly pointed out , is the first step towards creating a single market in corporate ownership . #% Mr President , I can not tell you how excited I am to be here this evening to talk on behalf of the PPE-DE Group on this subject . #% The effectiveness of a sensible Carbon Tax Trading Scheme depends upon internationalising the market . #% When I look outside the Chamber today , with the pouring rain , I think we are very close to the end of the summer . #% Yet instead of structural funds being granted to economically deprived areas , the rapporteur proposes that , on enlargement , money should be channelled to disadvantaged mountainous , remote or island regions - a much narrower definition for distribution . #% Pilotage was included in this proposal . #% These murders were the apex of a spiralling campaign of violence against Christians of all denominations . #% I hope that it will enable the European Union to retain its credibility as the world 's leading force in pressing for action to curb global warming . #% That is one of the many reasons why the British Conservatives are campaigning vigorously to persuade the UK to keep its own currency and to keep the pound and to stay out of the single currency . #% I suggest you and your colleagues on the Bureau might like to look at ways in which we can improve the flexibility of this plenary in response to both Commission and Council at moments like this . #% One of our amendments would give greater rights of reunion to unmarried , including same-sex , couples . #% Brian 's family is not alone : there are many such cases in the UK where people have lost loved ones to such violent deaths , yet no one is punished or held to account publicly in a court of law . #% Its only real belief is in ensuring its own survival , and the European Union should not assist it in that aim by lending the kind of support that we have already seen . #% We have to get the right notes between the Council and the Parliament playing in the right order if we are to have this harmonious relationship . #% People here find the atmosphere in this building very dry , not just politically , but in environmental terms , and we would very much welcome that provision . #% I can remember the time when we were taken back to Heathrow via Dublin . #% Mr President , I would also like to compliment Mr Cunha on his report . #% Yet , the good old traditional own resources are the cause of major headaches for control and concern about fraud . #% They have never been asked in honest terms . #% I , and Mr Samland , Mr Colom i Naval , Mrs D√ºhrkop D√ºhrkop and Mr Tomlinson - those who were involved in the negotiations - have to convince our group tonight , when we discuss the issue , that this report is worthy of a yes vote . #% So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success . #% And how will the EU engage with a new unitary Palestinian Authority that has Hamas , a terrorist organisation banned by the EU , as one of its components ? #% In the light of various apparent miscarriages of justice recently in the US , the lack of control on use of data by other law enforcement agencies is of great concern . #% Why is the organisation and the function of Parliament so distinctive from the Commission as to require a different career structure ? #% Liz has outlined some of the background to it . #% With the ACP countries , I acknowledge that so-called Article 96 consultations have taken place with 15 countries over the last eight years , in 11 cases leading to appropriate measures . #% You are going to change your bookkeeping rules , your IT systems and your project management . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , let me say how delighted I am that we are finally discussing the Goldstone report in plenary , because it is a vitally important issue , and to date , the EU has been shamefully absent in these issues . #% Thirdly , given the considerable functional overlap , has the Commission considered merging them ? #% We fiddled at the edges and said , `` Well , we might do this '' and , as Mrs Foster said , `` Well , we said you could pay compensation for the lost days '' . #% There has been great pressure applied by the British Government , but this must not be a case where a big country is let off the hook . #% We have always maintained , and continue to maintain , that the Lisbon Treaty lacks democratic legitimacy largely because a referendum was promised in the UK by all three establishment political parties , and all three establishment political parties spectacularly reneged on that promise . #% I do not think he can just get around that , and I believe the mutual recognition argument has strong force , as in other sectors like criminal law . #% I understand that the Commission proposals did not receive an altogether positive response from Council . #% I should like to tell the Commissioner here this afternoon that last year Mr Qian Qichen , the Foreign Minister of China , said that he could only take the European Union seriously when it had a single currency . #% We are being told , no , no , it is not dead , the patient is still alive , and the ratification process will continue . #% The visit of the President of the United States to Europe last month heralded a new chapter in the world 's most important geopolitical partnership . #% This directive has the potential to be the means to allow our citizens to be investors in the future of Europe 's enterprise and to secure the health and vitality of our economy . #% For the United States and Canada , for example , we see no reason why there should be the further impediments set out in Amendments Nos 7 , 8 and 9 . #% Hundreds of thousands of people have died and millions have been evicted from their homes . #% That is why we must support these proposals . #% It may be that in a year 's time and in a new context it will be possible to retain this text as it stands , or with certain additions clarifying it , or with interpretations , or with additional protocols , or by rewriting Part 3 , as some have suggested . #% It is a remarkable achievement . #% If I can say that in under two minutes , it is not unreasonable to expect the Commission and Eurostat to get their act together in three years . #% We have seen in very recent months and , indeed , over the last year , worrying hate-speak used by politicians in certain parts of the Union . #% That argument was settled years ago when we accepted Turkey 's membership of the Council of Europe . #% Indeed , the British Presidency in 1976 , when represented in the Energy Council by one Tony Benn , took the initiative of saying that Council should meet in public when acting on legislation . #% At the same time , I also recognise that we need a negotiating arena that is both robust and realistic . #% That is a function of the rest of our water quality : if we get that right , then drinking water will also be correct . #% It is unclear whether he had full access to legal advice throughout the trial process . #% You are in a hole of your own making . #% Mr President , I would like to make a short statement - which I had intended to make yesterday - about events yesterday at Charles de Gaulle Airport . #% But now we move on to Mali in April , when we will be looking at serious issues of human rights ; humanitarian aid ; post-tsunami development aid ; working together to defeat poverty , hunger and disease ; and to create the opportunities for achievement and the blossoming of those rich countries which make up the ACP of Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific . #% In response , the OSCE stated that the conduct of these elections overall was not sufficient to constitute meaningful progress in the democratic development of that country . #% To put this in context , we know that many of the countries acceding to the EU in May also still have many problems to overcome . #% Mr President , it was well worth the effort , if only to come and agree with Mr Bangemann - which is a rare occurrence for myself in this Parliament , but I do so very happily on this occasion - and to congratulate the rapporteur . #% It has been good politics , and at the heart of it has been Mrs Gebhardt . #% Mr President , travelling across the Union can sometimes seem like travelling in a time machine . #% It is imperative that the LTTE is held to account for its actions and that further international pressure is brought to bear on it at this time . #% The desperation of those people in Sudan puts into perspective some of the debates that we have in our countries in Europe about asylum and immigration . #% I know that the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs has already raised this with the Swedish presidency and we must hope it bears fruit . #% 
It is an unbelievable situation but it is one in which we can join hands , bring forces to bear upon the Taliban society and free those poor women . #% Please support my proposals . #% The EU 's protectionist attitude is no long-term help , it is just sticking plaster and that always peels off after a while . #% Over one quarter of the Members of this House signed a petition to this effect and this controversial issue , which generated a lot of press attention and outside interest by our constituents , deserves better than to be swept under the carpet with no democratic debate being allowed . #% We also note that despite several requests to visit , the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers has yet to receive an invitation from the Tunisian Government . #% No migration testing is available to test how much of these chemicals enters people 's bodies . #% That is why we need these measures . #% Let us be honest about it , but then honesty , of course , is something that we avoid in this Chamber ! #% By completing the single European market it will give Europe ' s consumers more choice of goods and services , of higher quality and at lower prices and will , therefore , spur greater increases in living standards . #% When will it dawn on you that the European economic mess is precisely because of this kind of interference ? #% I said on Tuesday how important it was , with the new roll-call system and the new proposals coming out from the Conference of Presidents , that Members should understand all the regulations and that we should circulate these regulations to Members . #% The PKK has committed some atrocities but these have been far outweighed by those perpetrated by the Turkish army . #% I saw a small demonstration outside the European Parliament that I would put at no more than 300 . #% That is what the port owners say themselves and these port owners would see their incentive for vital new investments destroyed . #% Some are identical , tabled by different Members ; and there is even a case of two identical amendments being tabled by the same Member . #% Now we know for sure , as we have always suspected , that the rhetoric of the US and its major corporations was a sham . #% Indeed it is a rare budget when we find that we do not yet have some of the programmes in place , because the multiannual programmes are in the process now of being completed as , let us hope , the Financial Regulation will be in place for the beginning of next year to be the basis for our operation . #% Surely an international court which signals that the international community will not allow gross breaches of law to go unpunished coincides with the objectives of the United States global security doctrine . #% Mr President , this is another case where confusion has arisen because the amendments distributed before the vote do not quite correspond to the amendments contained in the report because there was a linguistic correction in between , but Mr Wuermeling is right . #% I understand that the Council has waived the ban for this conference , as it felt that this was necessary in view of its obligations to the United Nations . #% As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders , along with a single currency , organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked . #% We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe , confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation , encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet , show that e-Europe is a good initiative . #% The five plus one option involving early negotiations with Hungary , Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovenia , Estonia and Cyprus is the only realistic strategy . #% Imagine my disappointment after the meeting when an official came up to me and said that while I was making those points on behalf of Parliament another Member also from the UK was busy shaking his head negatively the whole time that I was speaking . #% The roaster companies must take greater responsibility for paying farmers a fair price for what they grow , to enable them to send their children to school , pay for health care and just put food on the table . #% Discarding nearly two million tonnes of healthy fish each year is absolutely ridiculous . #% We strongly support a responsible attitude towards our environment . #% Mr President , this Brok-Wynn report has some fundamental statements in it . #% The headwaters of several river systems are to be found in Kashmir and we are all aware of the security implications of that . #% I speak specifically of the issue of regional management of the common fisheries policy . #% Mr President , I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets has endorsed so many of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , in particular budget line B7-524 - assistance in the nuclear sector . #% Developing a European policy to bring young people into the profession is a vital means of providing both highquality seafarers and helping resolve the problems of unemployment in Europe , not least in our maritime communities . #% But what they really need are banking services for getting that cheaper loan to be able to expand their business and employ more people and create more wealth locally ; insurance services , making sure that when their life or their business is ruined and something goes wrong , they have something to fall back on ; legal services , enforcing those contracts made with partners ; and communications services , knowing the best prices at local markets , deciding when to go to local markets and actually get into local markets . #% The ordinary Iraqi family 's purchase , even of one bar of soap , was politically directed and controlled . #% Mr President , I also wish to thank the Chairman and rapporteur of the committee , Mrs Redondo Jim√©nez and Mr Kreissl-D√∂rfler , who have been excellent in the way they have handled this committee . #% I am proposing that the Council and Commission ' s proposal for a regulatory committee be endorsed . #% We can not persecute our own citizens . #% Mr President , first of all let me congratulate my good friend Mr Laschet on his brave attempt to reform the structures of the UN , which were shown to be sadly lacking during the recent Gulf War . #% I would recommend a positive vote tomorrow and , I hope , rapid action by the Commission to implement the recommendations . #% Normally our colleague Mrs Junker would have replaced him , but she has been unwell and in hospital . #% Mrs Mann said , quite rightly , that we will have new people , both from America and from the European Union . #% He was a highly valued if not slightly boring member , who tried to prevent us going too far in our recommendations and acted as a brake on some of us who were more enthusiastic about pushing forward . #% Mr President , I am pleased to hear that Parliament will be receiving documents before we are supposed to be drawing up our reports - that is something positive . #% All of these will make all of our travel , on coach or bus safer and more risk free . #% So just as when my report , at the White Paper stage , demanded a system based on science and focused on safety , again we say right across this House : keep the food safety authority slim , transparent , independent and dedicated to assessment of food safety risk and to recommendations as to what action , if any , should be taken . #% The ALDE Group also calls for deletion of paragraph 38 , which appears to seek the abolition of intellectual property rights . #% We all accept the need to support farming in rural communities , but we have to find different crops and different ways of supporting them in the future . #% We should welcome , therefore , the expansion of industrial crop activity and the opportunities provided for diversification . #% Significantly , they talk about the unauthorised disclosure of such information not disadvantaging , harming or prejudicing the essential interests of Europol . #% They were cockle picking on the sands , the tide came in and they were all drowned . #% We must have a debate based on the facts and not the myths . #% My own group has problems and will be tabling amendments and requesting split votes on particular points . #% On the other hand , the Parliament , despite its pretensions , lacks the European demos and therefore can not claim to be a democratic institution . #% Can Mr Henderson confirm that , in fact , that is also the common position of the Council ? #% I have to stress this . #% Progress has been made in economic reform and I congratulate President Barroso and his colleagues for the work they have done there . #% On that occasion my colleagues and I were able to obtain her clear support for sanctions against the military regime in Burma . #% We have a strict range of products which can be sold now throughout the single market . #% I want to restrict my comments to Freddy Blak 's excellent report on the Commission discharge for 1999 . #% The Council wanted to exclude them in principle and only consider including them on the basis of a Commission study looking at possible distortions at some point in the future . #% In addition , I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997 . #% And yet despite this no condemnation of the United Nations or the conference for allowing this to happen . #% Projects like this need support , and need financial support . #% It must be said that it is all pretty transparent . #% The previous paragraph , number 48 , makes clear that the largest functioning democracy in the world is India , a country that I much admire . #% This is why I have tabled an amendment , on behalf of my group , which calls for this question to be clarified . #% 
It is also very important that all of us secure the right climate for enterprise , with less red tape and less bureaucracy , to encourage SMEs and risk-takers to actually consider taking out risk capital in the first place . #% I would recommend - although there is a free vote in my group - that we vote in favour of Amendment No 1 and that we start to label wine in the same way as we label other products . #% If , in the future , we want to prevent European Union trade policy being shaped - and sometimes arbitrarily shaped - by both the press and specific campaign groups , we must reassert parliamentary prerogatives in this field to open up the debate to proper , accountable public scrutiny . #% Nevertheless , we are both sincere in our views , opposing though they may be . #% Despite the recent outbreak in Allendale , the average is now two or three cases per day . #% I very much regret too that there are so few British Conservatives here in the Chamber today because it shows , with Greece now the twelfth member of the euro zone , how far from reality British euroscepticism about the future of the currency is . #% Mr President , I look forward with great interest to the Commissioner ' s reply to this debate . #% For some time Mrs Larive has steered the opinion of Parliament in this area on liberal economic principles and the fact that there is a lack of amendments to her report testifies to the hard work she has done and the support she has received . #% On the worsening humanitarian situation , a growing number of places have become no-go areas for NGOs because of the current fighting . #% I was not keen on your enthusiasm for the Iraq war , which I regard as misguided and illegal . #% We have been unable to get clarity ; unable to get answers to specific questions ; and there has been a lack of public response to amendments tabled , not least in our committee meetings , as well as a lack of an effective social impact assessment , which might have gone some way to allaying public fears about what is in this . #% Consumers increasingly demand simple information about their meat , their eggs and their honey and should be able to look for international protection and advice which they can trust . #% Europe and its institutions can only be built with the long-lasting support of its peoples . #% Mr President , I am sorry to sound a note of disharmony in this debate , but this report needs to be taken in two respects . #% Israel allowed through a limited amount of food , some hygiene products , some cooking oil , and some heavy diesel fuel , in all a total of 110 truckloads - although UNRWA tells us that the Gaza Strip needs 500 truckloads of supplies each day . #% Standardisation would be better , but mutual recognition is the easier approach . #% Yes , we have made progress in terms of access to documents and publishing the results of votes in the Council . #% Slovakia , on which I am shadow rapporteur for my Group , has undergone huge changes over the last ten years , with the current government determined to deregulate . #% The latest draft of the code , in addition to defining circumstances of internal repression or external aggression , which would trigger denial of exports , states that consideration would be given to whether ` the proposed export would seriously undermine the economic and social development of the recipient country ' . #% It is clear that in a world of completely deregulated and unfettered free trade the so-called ` China price ' will drag costs and standards down right across the globe , with the harshest impact on the poorest . #% Mr President , organic farming means nature governing food , but the EU wants a law of nature written in Brussels . #% If we simply cut the supply and not the demand , then we will end up with a higher price for the drugs on the street and with more crime being committed to pay for people 's habits . #% US security interests are shifting towards the Pacific , even if NATO and EU enlargements will demand transatlantic political management in the months ahead . #% If they continue to have fears , I shall be very happy to meet them to try to find a solution to any issue they wish to raise . #% They have gone into orbit and landed on another planet like the astronauts for which the HACCP system was devised . #% The social partners may well have a very useful role in some countries and in some cases but , given that the majority of employment growth is coming from SMEs whose employees are beholden neither to big business nor to big unions , it is hard to see how such a move would be positive for job creation . #% Mr President , if the House follows my recommendation - which I hope it will - this will achieve an outcome that was agreed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and can be accepted by the Commission and the Council . #% Mr President , yesterday the Council 's representatives agreed to an effective ban across the European Union on white asbestos and yet there are some concerns that there will be unnecessary delays in the signature of this particular document , which Parliament has played a very positive role in bringing to the fore . #% You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier . #% It is not simple but it has been used and there is no simple solution here . #% One of the benefits of dictatorship , of course , is often that the lid is kept on social , religious and racial tensions . #% Its demolition in my view is very sad and a big mistake , just at the time when it could be needed most . #% So let us have a debate based on the facts , not on the myths . #% In fact the report was called so early that I was not here on time , and I apologise to both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for not being here to hear their speeches . #% We see countries like my own , claiming to have banned animal testing , when all they have done is export the problem to countries where animals are even less respected . #% Firstly , the value of strong regulatory authorities . #% Differences at times are so great between the best and the worst that there is a lack of confidence which can lead to those who try to deliver objective decisions feeling undermined by those who do not . #% In conclusion , I accept our rapporteur 's interesting proposal to create an EU-wide action programme , designed to attract young people to sea . #% Who is right ? #% That fragile nature is , as you recognised , a global concern , not just one that concerns Europe or indeed those nations in the Arctic . #% I listened with great interest to what Commissioner Barrot said . #% I know the Commission is dealing a lot with this , but we also have to look at how we get the Sapard funds into enlargement states to help them build up their infrastructure , including their education systems . #% First of all , I welcome Richard Howitt 's suggestion , and Simon Coveney 's as well , that we should act on today 's useful exchange and hold further discussions on our two reports . #% Similarly , the report rightly calls for restraint by the Indian military , with full respect by the security forces for human rights , the wellbeing of civilian populations and observance of issued court orders . #% First , does he agree with me that we have got to sell enlargement to , in particular , the people of the European Union ? #% Initiatives to benefit towns and cities still have to be made by diverting powers from other headings . #% It is in that spirit that it was drafted and in which I am sure it will be adopted tomorrow by this Parliament . #% In 1990 the Commission refused access to documents because it claimed there might be legal proceedings . #% I have submitted a more detailed question on this matter but would be interested in hearing the Commissioner 's initial thoughts on the issue . #% Terrorists can not succeed unless they have the financial means with which to do so . #% This is not an item of codecision , it is an item where we have an opinion . #% Finally , I would like to refer to the report on the front page of last week 's European Voice , which proclaims that the new EU rapid reaction force is apparently planning to use depleted uranium weapons . #% We should also do things that are proportionate : there is cadmium in our atmosphere but less than 1 % is caused by batteries -- much more comes from pesticides and other uses -- so we must have legislation that is proportionate to what we are trying to achieve . #% Growing population in turn places an increasing burden on food supplies which , if crops fail , leads to crisis and starvation . #% The ELDR would like to thank Mrs Migu√©lez Ramos for her hard work on the dossier ; we find particularly valuable the stress that is placed on the need to secure greater compliance with international law and for improved measures against illegal and unreported fishing . #% Let us be clear , that what we have proposed in these alternative jurisdiction clauses is not something for the larger businesses . #% I hope that in passing in what I think will be a unanimous resolution , supported right across the House , that we can send a message , not to the Turkish Government but to the Turkish judiciary , to be realistic , to get up to date and , for a change , to support their government in trying to restore respect for the Turkish judiciary within Turkey . #% All that range , to a certain degree , is given this treatment . #% As countries with territory in the Arctic , the United States , Canada , Russia , Norway and Iceland all defend their interests robustly and vigorously . #% It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary . #% My final point is that it is absolutely essential that we have European-wide rules that are binding throughout the territories of the European Union , otherwise the Kralowetz case will be just one of many which we will see in the weeks and months to come . #% Mr President , this has undoubtedly been a good debate between the institutions and 2003 will be an important year against the backdrop of enlargement . #% It is better to target pornography which exploits real children , not pretend ones . #% Occasionally we exchanged a sharp word but it was all in the spirit of friendship and cooperation . #% He gave an incorrect date , there was a mistranslation of a question and , in my view , he gave some very misleading information to this Parliament . #% They touch the culture of our different legal systems very deeply . #% 
The second reason is that it makes the case for more democratic procedures . #% All in all , this will make us more competitive and will help in the fight against serious illness and environmental problems . #% Apparently `` maximum possible '' is not quite maximum enough . #% Thirdly , the law itself is cumbersome and will add considerably to the costs of art markets by adding a tier of bureaucracy and expense . #% Mr President , here we have what is basically a good measure . #% Clearly , when market forces of themselves will not provide cost-effective research for drugs for our own children , it is not surprising that there are even fewer resources available for developing and poor countries . #% You can not proceed on the basis , as the Spanish Defence Minister has said , that we are addressing a third of our capability requirements . #% Knowing how much volunteers contribute to our well-being , I sometimes wonder just how much of a society we would have without their efforts . #% Experienced parliamentarians in this House will have no difficulty in understanding the concept of maladministration and will easily know what is the ombudsman 's sphere of responsibility . #% I welcome this report which calls for a consolidation of existing European food hygiene and animal health inspections . #% To be realistic , we need funding from defence budgets for space projects in a number of fields . #% The ECR fully supports this report and I again thank Commissioner Damanaki for committing herself to abolishing discards . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , this is , for us , the final chapter of a very long-running play that started with a Commission proposal in July 2003 , but had a longer period of preparation stretching back beyond that . #% Mr President , I am speaking only to the Fabra Vall√©s report as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% I first report , without any complacency , that in the five months since the Commission adopted the detailed consultative document on reform and modernisation of human resources policy , progress has been sustained and progress has been satisfactory . #% I want to suggest how she could do much better than this . #% All 25 governments and the Commission have indicated that they will accept all the amendments Parliament has passed . #% Mr President , the Visby Summit is a welcome initiative of vital concern to the future development of the Baltic Sea region , discussing as it will security , crime , the environment and EU enlargement . #% In the Wise Men ' s report into the last Commission , it was noted that it is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility . #% On the other hand , as a balance , perhaps we need to ensure that there are safeguards to discourage the small minority who might want to use marriage as an avenue to gain illegal entry . #% So why was this matter allowed to fester since January as the security forces ignored the illegal occupation of land , the stockpiling of weapons and the abduction of women into the mosque complex ? #% Consequently , on behalf of the Party of European Socialists , I am pleased to offer our support to the rapporteur tonight . #% Fourthly , it should speak of the process and threshold of adhesion and flesh out the policy on neighbourhood , which we have in draft form . #% However , we certainly need a Europe of results , as President Barroso has rightly suggested . #% I simply should like to emphasise the fact that the reason the Court of Auditors has found it difficult to sign off the accounts is not because of corruption in the European Union -- as distinct from the Member States -- but because the Member States do not assist the European Union to give the sort of valid accountancy that the Court of Auditors and EU institutions require . #% As Mr Bowis said , just saying ` no ' does not work - it certainly does not work in most of the societies in which we live . #% Had she told me to go the other way , I would have done . #% A lot has been done , but there is still a lot to do . #% I am not arguing that it is necessary , but should it be necessary , could we not expect a view from the presidency over whether this particular case actually causes it some concern ? #% Madam President , I would like to confine my remarks to the Hermange report , and start by saying this is not the speech that I had intended to make . #% This is the only way we can ensure that decent and humane standards are applied . #% The power of the purse is a core function , a most central and long-standing power of the parliaments in all our Member States . #% Freedom of association , expression and of the press must be maintained . #% All in all , we are supporting adaptability in enterprise and we want to see greater employability and to reduce the skills gap which is the main structural deficit in the Union at the present time . #% We also fully welcome the federal trials for people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , but why did it not happen eight years ago ? #% My concern in saying that is that the Commission is underestimating the size of the challenge we face . #% Therefore , Commissioner , when we are looking at professional qualifications and seeking ways of facilitating professional mobility , as we should , we are not just talking about job opportunity or filling vacancies , or even individual professional freedom . #% We strongly support a defence agency , but its focus should be on building military capability across the Member States , not on the procurement of equipment for a separate EU defence force , which has not even been proposed . #% When I chaired a press conference of the ACP Group in Hong Kong I got a real sense of their feeling of frustration and betrayal . #% Second , I look forward to working with your presidency on the implementation of patient mobility . #% Our most powerful weapon is our imagination . #% The sad thing about the report was that essentially it stated in black and white that there should be no opt-out at all under any circumstances and that the UK should be taken to court for alleged abuses , as if to say : my mind is made up , do not confuse me with the facts . #% The UK Government says it is an informal communication and that it does not reveal informal communications . #% We have over 50 signatures , but unfortunately only seven are from Member States and ironically one is from a non-Member State -- Switzerland . #% Not a very creditable reflection on the famous European social pact . #% As I pointed out in that letter to Mrs Gradin , and as the House will be aware , the Staff Regulations applicable to all EU institutions make it clear that the Commission as an institution and as an employer is legally liable to assist employees in defending themselves against attack . #% We do not agree that the General Agreement on Trade in Services will be a job engine , either here or in the developing world . #% I too like many colleagues was interested in the response of many people of Pakistani origin and background to this coup - people who are themselves involved in democratic politics and concerned about good democratic practice . #% I do not want to get too hung up on water . #% However , mutual recognition , whether for family status or status as a person with disabilities , for example , will also continue to be an issue . #% I can only say that , in my view , the gap that exists between the political classes of Europe and the ordinary men and women of Europe has never been wider . #% We see no connection between the need for a resolute response to the recent terrorist attacks and the call for intensification of efforts to operationalise the European Security and Defence Policy . #% in writing . - I welcome the adoption of this report . #% So next year , we want the Commission to come forward with an annual report which ties these policies together , which links it to competitiveness , to see whether or not there is real compatibility between the various directorates-general and the policies that are pursued by the European Union . #% Finally , it means limiting the supply of arms overall . #% That is a case of harassment at the workplace . #% If that were true , why have I and my colleagues been getting increasingly frantic messages from organisations and individual companies of all sizes , in such major industries as agriculture , horticulture , construction , tourism and hospitality ? #% I do not ask the Commissioner to take action against the British Government for any failings in that period . #% It has long been the Commission 's intention not only to maintain such technical assistance but also to increase it . #% Secondly , we need a transatlantic summit which takes a strategic view , rather than looking at particular instances and particular problems . #% I think it is important to say that we very much welcome the progress that has been made on that new electronic register . #% Two-thirds of the young doctors in that country leave the country within three years of graduation , and yet Africa bears 25 % of the world 's health and disease burden , and has only 0.6 % of the world 's health professionals . #% It is very important that we solve this issue . #% The United Kingdom rebate was created because of the inequity of our net contribution compared to our receipts from the Community budget . #% I agree with the Commissioner and the rapporteur that it is very important to remove technical and other barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement in Europe . #% The Breton language exists in Brittany . #% 
We continue our investigation , but we have no magic wand to restore the fortunes of the aggrieved policyholders . #% The fact that President Mugabe wants to stifle inward investment by nationalising the farms , and threatening to do the same with the mines , will do nothing to resolve the economic situation in Zimbabwe . #% The Commission 's overall target , as announced at the beginning of our term of office in 1999 , is to double the number of women in these two grades during its term in office , thereby raising the number of women in A1 and A2 posts to 44 or about 20 % by 2005 . #% We further need a more harmonised system of end-use data provision , certification and enforcement . #% Mr President , I would like to commend Mrs Ahern on the brevity of her report . #% But we are blessed with a truly pluralist procedure - an exciting and novel one - and we retain the freedom within the Convention to ask ourselves questions . #% We have heard about chainsaws , but there are many other examples . #% Would it not be more appropriate to adopt a new mandate and in it make explicit the rights of public authorities and institutions at all levels to regulate public services in order to maintain social and environmental standards free from challenge under GATS ? #% Certainly , at the moment it is difficult to get past each country 's various examination systems and teaching philosophies to reach any objective comparison of the teaching standards of the countries . #% So I am very pleased that the European Commission is tomorrow having a consultation with NGOs in Brussels . #% The great challenge facing us now is to get the Constitution through the IGC without it being dismantled bit by bit . #% We have a duty to India to reverse those trends . #% Those vital elements of liberation still have to be secured in Vietnam . #% Mr President , my group welcomes the publication of the Dehaene , Lord Simon and von Weizs√§cker report because it makes the case clearly , and makes it well , to have an IGC that is not confined to the so-called `` three Amsterdam leftovers '' . #% I would like to ask first of all for some clarification of remarks made by the French Trade Minister , Christine Lagarde , when she came to Parliament 's Committee on International Trade just last week . #% We must try and help find a political solution to the Kurdish problem which in many ways is the cause of much of Turkey 's paranoia and insecurity . #% The EMU , as we know , is the most historic development that will take place in the European Union since the creation of the European Economic Community . #% I do not share Mr Bot 's enthusiasm for the European arrest warrant , for example . #% Costs in the UK should be met where there are reasonable grounds for treatment abroad . #% So the words : ` point to the importance of the cease-fire declared by the PKK on 28 August 1998 and calls on the Turkish authorities to seize the opportunity thus created to seek a peaceful and negotiated political solution to the Kurdish question ' , are to be placed at the end of paragraph 16 . #% Are the Council and the Commission so convinced ? #% I believe also that Parliament 's Budgetary Control Committee ought to be strengthened . #% My final point is about the site of the new authority . #% The European Union has made major efforts over a number of years to ensure this Customs Union is successful , and Turkey herself must now ensure that she fulfils the role that she is called upon to play . #% It started with a visit from a young Zimbabwean with our local asylum seekers ' organisation . #% He should never have been charged . #% I just wanted to follow up on the last common position , where there is a distinct lack of clarity regarding the lists of companies . #% This was not a Community-wide problem , but in countries like the Irish Republic and Britain it mattered very greatly , and much good has been done by the clarification provided . #% Mr President , I welcome the part of the proposed resolution relating to health and meeting health targets . #% If the Rules Committee decides that , in the circumstances , the will of the House was clearly to approve the amendment by a sufficient majority , that should then be proclaimed as the decision and we should not have to come back and vote again on the item . #% We agree very much that internationalism is important , but the current international trade rules favour narrow business interests and not the poor and the environment . #% I would like to thank our fellow rapporteurs , the other two institutions and the Commissioner in particular for their hard and constructive work in achieving the final compromise package . #% The vast majority of our trade with the rest of the world is by sea . #% The Commission is working in a coordinated manner with the Council . #% If we want more money for culture in Europe , let us think seriously about a European lottery to get the money for it . #% As we have just heard , it is not going to be until 11 March that we get further developments . #% I would ask my colleagues on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , the Social Affairs Committee and the Consumer Protection Committee to support the position of the pensioners affected when the new legislation is introduced . #% I support and encourage him to further consider the proposals about service levels and access for disabled people . #% But particularly in the ECB ' s case , as it does not have the track record of the mighty Bundesbank and could quickly lose the confidence of the financial markets if it is reluctant to protect itself through greater transparency . #% Secondly we must make sure that radioactive material should never be transported on ships carrying passengers . #% I particularly want to thank the Luxembourg presidency for the fact that , under the leadership of Minister Kreck√© , it has moved forward with the vital work on the Services Directive . #% The government rightly recognised this as a very serious matter and ordered appropriate investigations . #% Quite regardless of the subject matter , some of which we Conservatives like and some of which we do not , we shall be voting against the report because we believe it looks at its subject matter the wrong way around - in a way that we believe is wrong for Europe . #% Strasbourg is indeed a beautiful city . #% But I am afraid some of the amendments to which the Commission has already made reference take away from the spirit of our initial intentions and the initial way in which we reacted . #% There was general agreement that from 2008 the directive should be compulsory . #% I am happy to accept his compromise wording but I would still like to have seen references not just to the region of Kashmir but also to the sufferings of the people of Kashmir . #% Whatever else is true , it is apparent that the internal checks and balances were not operating successfully between London and Singapore . #% The EPP 's amendments seek to divide families . #% Mr President , first of all I should like to say to the two Commissioners here -- one of whom was in Canc√∫n -- how well and hard they worked to get a solution to the WTO negotiations . #% The previous UDF administration faced enormous difficulties and I wish to acknowledge its success in many areas . #% But what we do not need is two separate and different ways of not expressing a position for or against a particular text . #% We are also concerned , President Prodi , at the lack of proposals concerning the tourism sector , a sector in which so many of our citizens work . #% I rather doubt if many will be , and I do not think that the annexes themselves contain anything like the number of exceptions that we should see . #% The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , when considering this proposal for legislation , sought to make significant improvements and in his speech our rapporteur Mr Castagnetti has already explained some of the thinking behind his very helpful proposals . #% Madam President , even though you asked me to group together my roll-call votes - I was surprised you asked me in this particular report and not someone else in the Fiori report . #% Aviation fuel is not taxed , it is not subject to VAT and it is not covered by the Kyoto Protocol . #% There are needle exchanges , which protect not just the addicts , but also the people with whom they are in contact . #% The reason for that comment , Mr Dell ` Alba , was precisely because there had been parachutages . #% Furthermore , will the Presidency accept that Member States have a duty to condemn such discrimination because they are signatories to the employment framework directive which prohibits discrimination including on the grounds of sexuality and which must be transposed by 2003 ? #% Improving the energy performance of buildings , however it is defined , is the most difficult issue that I have ever had to grapple with . #% All of us realise the importance of these public health measures : we need only recall the terrible food poisoning incident that took place in Scotland owing to the contamination of red meat only a few years ago . #% I am absolutely certain that the speech which Mr Marin is now anxiously looking through rejects what I am about to say . #% Simply raising the targets without any thoughtful consideration of them is not something that we should do on this occasion . #% We have been able to coordinate these reports so that we can have this general debate today on what is an extremely important and indeed a historic issue for the European Union . #% Let us have some determined action for the sake of all the people of Zimbabwe . #% 
Of course nutritional profiling can be done : experts have done it and it is being done in the United States . #% But they are also entitled to ask how their money is spent , including the EUR 5350 million on Euromed in the period up to 2007 . #% We are dealing here with little more than media hysteria and ignorance . #% One of the things that triggered my interest was that the original proposal presented by your predecessor , Mr Liikanen , was significantly flawed . #% It worries me greatly that agricultural and horticultural research organizations and university departments which used to be publicly funded are now increasingly reliant on multinational companies for their finance and are thereby prevented from pursuing basic biotechnological research , independent of the need to make a rapid financial return . #% Meanwhile , as regards the tabling of amendments you have exactly the same right as every other Member to table amendments with 32 signatures . #% Some of these procedures are simply going to cancel that effort altogether . #% I would further point out that there is nothing to prevent the Commission from amending its proposal at any time after the vote tomorrow , except perhaps institutional and political reluctance . #% It is very important at the moment that there should be no delay in driving forward the Lisbon Agenda , the current liberalisation policies or the sustainable development arguments . #% For centuries we accepted people from all over the world , but in small numbers so that they could settle peacefully and productively . #% If he concludes that they are true , the question for us is what is the degree of complicity of EU governments ? #% We are all happy to do this . #% There was no need to start this debate at the time it did start . #% We should be proud and grateful to the Commissioners and the officials , our own rapporteurs and ministers and the campaigners and the doctors who have fought for this moment for their determination and courage to do the right thing . #% It also encourages pioneering activities . #% Recently I was at a nuclear power station where they have a battery the size of a building which provides the back-up power in the event of a power cut . #% The more we anchor our partnership in shared respect for our common values , the more strongly we can act to resonate those values in the wider world . #% I have asked the President to consider this matter . #% There are many other sectors of the economy where the supply chain now is completely different to the way it existed ten years ago . #% What is most disturbing is that the rapporteur and the Commissioner seem to be arguing that if we did not take up these fishing rights some other nation would and that somehow that might be even worse . #% If one of those animals gets a disease , why kill the whole herd ? #% Is he aware that the transit system as it now operates is so porous that billions of ecus are being lost across the Member States and that serious efforts are by the Member States are needed to inject the necessary urgency and political will into the resolution of this problem ? #% I ran a competition in the East Midlands offering a bottle of champagne for the first confirmed sighting of my illustrious but missing colleague Mr Robert Kilroy-Silk . #% In doing so , they massively increased their profits , selling tickets in corporate blocks as small as one . #% I understand that you have written to Mr Coates . #% What swung it for me , when I looked at this for the first time in detail , was that there is an alternative . #% Another thing they want - but do not always get - is follow-through in the area where animal welfare is promised , but not always delivered . #% In his comments , Mr Hoppensted rightly said that the question of the convergence of the technology and the limitless possibilities of the technology were a guiding factor in the drawing up of his report . #% As somebody who is about to go to Poland next week with the joint parliamentary committee , I should also like to emphasize the very high levels of growth being achieved both by Poland and the Czech Republic among the applicant states . #% Nevertheless , the key problem here is that despite massive EU and national governments loans to Airbus , it was run like some kind of Edwardian corner shop with minimum consultation with the workforce . #% We want to know where the safeguards are going to be , what the political oversight is going to be , how that is going to involve the European Parliament and our national parliaments and what redress is available for those who find themselves caught up and on lists that they should never have been on in the first place . #% That accounts for why Amnesty International has called it one of the most compelling cases of innocence human rights campaigners have ever seen . #% Finally , it also has some measures related to digital television , particularly a package of obligations related to `` must carry '' provisions for public service broadcasts . #% It is a debate about the escalating humanitarian crisis . #% In its report a year ago , Parliament sent out an unduly negative message to Turkey and failed to recognise the scale of positive developments that had taken place in the preceding 12 months . #% My Group does not believe that general-interest services can be treated in the same way as companies which produce , for example , plastic key rings . #% The definition of `` serious crimes '' is uncertain , being left to 25 separate governments to each decide in their own way . #% I would say that Mrs Stihler 's very clear and comprehensive report improves on the Commission 's proposal in three major respects . #% It has introduced exchanges of officials ; it has introduced seminars on tax issues of common interest ; it has provided multilateral control exercises , it has developed professional training , such as audit skills ; it has improved language training and it has maintained and developed communication and information exchange systems . #% The annual legislative programme is the most concrete manifestation of the European Commission 's key constitutional and political power , namely the exclusive right of initiative . #% We have all seen what can happen to the meat market when the safety of consumers is neglected , allegedly to protect the market . #% Firstly , there is no doubt , despite all the efforts contained in the Mediterranean process , that unless we guarantee the peace process in the Middle East , everything we do will be undermined . #% Because this law to amend the Italian constitution has been before the Senate three or four times and the left have always obstructed it , although they have paid lip service to the idea that it is possible to make a new law to allow him back in . #% Mr President , I am sure that the Commissioner attends these events with a heavy heart , because he is responsible not just for the food chain and the feed chain but also the worst chain of all , the contamination chain . #% After 11 September quite clearly one partner , America , feels that it is a nation under attack . #% I wish to thank and congratulate the Commission . #% That is why it is important that deadlines are kept , particularly 2 November . #% Where has the GBP 75 billion gone ? #% The Commissioner said quite rightly that new technology is good . #% We all know that groups which indulge in sadistic and paedophilic practices mask their activities and hide behind other forms of identity . #% For these reasons we believe that recital W and paragraph 9 are wrong . #% I welcome Commissioner Patten 's allocation of EUR 300 million in 2003-04 to rebuild Iraq . #% However , I do not believe there is a shortage of small business opportunities , investment capital , or entrepreneurs who would be prepared to take risks in setting up businesses and taking on employees . #% We also note the kind suggestion that Parliament feeds into the European system the views of its own electors . #% That is because they do not want people to know that education has been handed over to the EU . #% We have drafted 60 clauses and provoked 1000 amendments . #% Let us hope that it is carried into effect and is more than mere soundbites and press releases . #% I listened to the list of those who were going to be present and it struck me that the process is actually similar to what happens down the pub on a Friday night where you get together with your mates , then go home and tell people what happened and if you are lucky other people might hear the best stories . #% We need to respect their difference of opinion , not attempt to raise it as a symbol of European moral superiority over the United States . #% As an elected representative , I believe it is my role to support moves to prevent an over-controlling media presence , not only in Italy but across European Member States . #% Of course there is a difficulty with the implementation of a common immigration and asylum policy . #% I believe that consumers have the right to clear identification of products they intend to purchase . #% Because the rapporteur has accepted so much it would probably be churlish of me to lament his non-acceptance of my amendment declaring that secure , inflation-proof pensions for public sector workers , such as Members of this Parliament , are seen as increasingly unfair by those in company schemes that depend on stock market performance in the real world . #% Finally , on the issue of where the joint undertaking should be located , I agree with the original Commission proposal that for practical reasons the seat should be in Brussels . #% This is a very important aim but it is important that all elements of the Water Framework Directive are workable and realistic . #% Europe needs direction on reforming the so-called social model . #% 
Since 1999 the revenues of European television companies have grown by an average of 46.3 % . #% I invite the President-in-Office to do that if he can . #% But we need to see more safeguards for drivers and working time . #% The rule seems to be : another day , another quango . #% Mr President , I wish to endorse all the praiseworthy remarks that have been made about Nicole Pery and to add one more : her experience was very valuable for the Committee on Fisheries because she is also on the Committee on Development and Cooperation , and the two aspects are linked in a report , of which I was the rapporteur , adopted in this Parliament in May . #% There is assumption in favour of access to the public for all documents in all areas of the Union 's activities and access will only be denied to those in areas which directly relate to a listed exception . #% We must all now seize upon this opportunity from the international community to implement this before we have a major Middle-Eastern war on our hands . #% We want to support and thank the Commission for its revised declaration . #% I can not believe the Commission and the Council intend to pursue this damaging path . #% It has nothing to do with enhancing the security of our citizens . #% We were able to fulfil part of our delegation duties , we met members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Congress and had some very useful , although very sad discussions with them . #% The black box will change the culture of shipping . #% Maybe that suits us for what may happen in the very near future . #% It is true that we came away from Pristina in June pretty concerned about the EU 's capacity to take on its future enhanced role in Kosovo and to see it through , because if we look at another territory where the international community took on state-building and reconstruction responsibilities -- i.e. Afghanistan -- we see incipient failure . #% I hope that this makes the PSE 's position on Amendment No 11 crystal clear . #% They symbolized the extent to which President Tudjman is prepared to ignore the Dayton accords and is prepared to fulfil his own agenda in undermining the peace agreement in Bosnia . #% We have tabled one amendment to Article 3 of the Statute , which would bring Members of the Commission and Members of Parliament as well as members of the agencies of the Union , such as Europol , beneath the purview of the Ombudsman . #% Amendments must either be tabled in the name of 32 Members or in the name of a political group and actually represent the position of that political group , not of the individual who happens to table them in the name of the group so as to circumvent the limitation on tabling rules in plenary . #% I hope that the Commission will take note of these points . #% Lastly , we would like to know if the reform of the institutions has continued . #% I , too , wish to speak clearly in favour of the proposal from our rapporteurs , Mr Virrankoski and Mr B√∂ge , but particularly in favour of the mobilisation of the solidarity fund for the UK . #% He may vote for it but the peoples of Europe have not voted for it . #% The NII takes this view on the basis of the robustness of the fuel manufacturing process and the totality of the checks made on the key parameters . #% Does the Minister accept that to be able to look at an example of having spread openness and transparency and having enhanced the ability of national parliaments to hold ministers to account would be quite a significant achievement ? #% I congratulate the rapporteur on the way he has worked with all political groups on this sensitive subject . #% Finally , it seems to me that perhaps the most important thing we have to do - which is a challenge ahead of us - is to influence and change public opinion on the need for conservation and efficiency . #% Madam President , sadly Afghanistan has been slightly forgotten about in the aftermath of the Iraq war . #% This is a matter on which I have spoken on a number of occasions in recent weeks , and one that should be at the heart of the European agenda in the coming years . #% That just does not apply to BSE , or internally , of course . #% That is why we would support the use of the budget line for aid to the victims of terrorism in order to provide finance for any civil action taken by the family -- money , I hasten to add , not directly for the family but money for a court action . #% Commissioner Fischler is sitting patiently , listening to our debate , and half our colleagues have been unable to contribute to it . #% Unless they respect the clauses of the Association Agreement , the Israelis will have difficulty in convincing the rest of the world that they are acting in good faith in issues such as the peace process as a whole . #% However , in the longer term it would be in the US 's interest to do so . #% They name and shame . #% So the Commission proposals are very timely . #% Operational expenditure must come from the Community budget . #% For example , the Scientific Steering Committee has recently established that it is necessary to regard the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglion as specified risk material in the UK only for bovines over 30 months and in Portugal only for those over 6 months . #% Our campaign has placed this question firmly on our nation ' s political agenda . #% They facilitate violent crime and they are used for terrorism . #% There is , as we all know , deep suspicion among Europe 's fishing communities that other countries ' fishermen are getting away with flouting the rules and , therefore , they do not see why they should keep them . #% No-one seems able or willing to find the money to increase the number of troops -- some 40 000 would be needed for nationwide coverage . #% Mr President , when Mr Juncker came to this Parliament in January to set out his presidency 's priorities , the UK Independence Party reminded him that he had spoken about a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget , including the British rebate . #% Who can fail to be moved by the images on the screens outside this Chamber and all the celebrations we have had this week marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall ? #% But they also want to know that they will not be subject to disproportionate and unnecessary restrictions and that includes requiring them to comply with duplicate sets of rules and authorisations when they have already complied with them in their own country . #% Given such reassurance , and on the understanding that both the Commission and the Council will take our reservations seriously , it is possible to support the proposal . #% The chemical industry is focused on as the villain of the piece and the substitution principle makes a well-earned reappearance in the amendments that the committee has asked the House to consider . #% Although discussions with staff representatives are not yet concluded , the Commission wishes to emphasise that as examination of all relevant figures will show - and the relevant figures are in the documents that I have circulated today and in the document adopted by the Commission on 18 July - the increase in yearly expenditure under Heading 5 generated by Commission reform will be modest and temporary . #% Mr President , the worst thing about Mr Bangemann 's imprudent career move is the threat that it poses to the Commission that he served . #% The Single European Sky and the proposals for checks on non-EU aircraft are important contributions to making our skies safer . #% Now I use the word ` ask ' with some care . #% Finally , let us take one of the bloodiest events of 2005 : the massacre of hundreds of people in Andijan on 13 May and the subsequent arrest and torture by the Uzbek authorities of seemingly anyone who might be a witness . #% The army barracks where I once served is named after Wilberforce , the anti-slavery campaigner . #% It has been a long gestation period . #% It is interesting to know that in future we hope it is going to be avoided . #% I would like you to confirm in any future remarks that it will be open to us - that is a critical point for our Group as we wish to see it applied across all institutions . #% Add in winter clothing , snow clearance and all the rest and it is obvious that to pay all workers the same would leave some with more spare cash than others . #% Indeed , the latest figures show that we are on target to reach only 9 % of the projected 20 % by 2020 . #% You can not push on with this project without the support of the people . #% Clearly , some of the people working in those shops will continue to work there ; some will not work there because the profitability is not the same . #% The private sector can not and should not walk away from the consequences of its actions , and the public sector , and indeed society and the public at large can not wash their hands and privatise the responsibilities incurred in regulating the private sector while enjoying the benefits which accrue from their actions . #% Why should young Europeans , properly trained and educated , not contribute to defeating unemployment in Europe as well as contributing to safer seas worldwide ? #% Mr President , I wish to begin by complimenting Mrs Cresson on containing her laughter when she was reading the script . #% The German Blue Angel and the Nordic Swan have led the way in eco-labelling . #% I ask you therefore to investigate whether an attempt is being made to gerrymander the electoral process in Malta and to report back to this House with your findings . #% We tabled an amendment , and so did Mrs Avil√©s Perea of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities , to say that the money that is voted for lobby organisations for women following the Beijing conference should not all go , as it has for many years , to the European Women 's lobby . #% Was it completely unforeseeable that Israel would undertake actions against international law by undertaking a policy of collective punishment ?

Now that we have got it through I want to thank the Council for the decision that they have taken and thank the Commission for their help . #% Mr Aristide took refuge in Africa , another continent sadly ravaged by civil wars , dictatorships and failed states . #% The Taoiseach referred just now to the importance of give and take in these negotiations . #% We must be well prepared and not fall down the same traps as with the foot-and-mouth outbreak , when there was no proper contingency planning in many Member States . #% How else do we explain the missing ballot boxes which suddenly turn up stuffed up with Mugabe votes ? #% We should be trying to encourage China to take its place in the world system , particularly its membership of the WTO . #% But we also confirm our concern to help more women into jobs rather than putting up further barriers to female employment . #% It was some two years ago , in the early months of 1995 that I collected the signatures of 25 % of the Members of this House to call for a Committee of Inquiry into the problems of Community fraud . #% Condoms do work . #% We know that as we soon will have 20-something states around the table of the Council any area that requires unanimity will be an area in which the European Union is likely to be paralysed . #% It is quite right that TB is a significant global health concern and , as we know , is the second leading cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide . #% We want to ensure that we can benefit the processing industry without affecting producers . #% Bulgaria will need assistance in creating sustainable new capacity that ensures security of supply and diversification , so that Bulgaria is not reliant on the goodwill of one foreign power . #% If some countries wish to persist in this , it is of course up to them . #% in writing . - The European Commission 's proposed Single Market Act aims to unlock the potential of the Single Market and put the EU 's economy and competitiveness back on track after the economic crisis . #% We need to support those who preserve on our behalf our rural environment and beautiful countryside , through special environmental payments . #% The authorities in France are not doing anything ; the Commission is not taking action . #% If that is the case , then how can supermarkets chains argue to us that a 0.1 % level is perfectly feasible ? #% It needs to be politically led rather than bureaucracies being left to run expensive programmes which will look like propaganda in the view of our citizens . #% These problems are significant and typified by Eurostat and have failed to be addressed . #% There are largely two approaches to dealing with this sort of issue . #% It will be interesting to see how some who feel free to pick and choose who should have effective limits on working time and who should not can explain that to the workers affected . #% Perhaps we should switch to the new system , but with a declaration allowing states perhaps for a transitional period to invoke the old system if they found themselves in the minority . #% My own committee , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , thought it particularly important that we make sure that the applicant states are aware of the legislation and are in a position to implement it as soon as possible . #% We have the famous review coming in 1999 but we really can not bundle everything into the review . #% I believe that this is a major step forward and that we should have comparative advertising where it can be shown not to be misleading , where there is rapid redress if misleading information does actually appear in the advertisement about which there is a complaint and where there are comparisons between goods or services which meet the same real need . #% The same is true of information . #% Mr President , on behalf of myself and the other Labour Members , I want to point out why we voted against today . #% I think that is an extremely worrying factor . #% Whilst this proposal was submitted in the name of safety and simplification , its contents provide for little more than further bureaucracy and regulation . #% It has to review the activities of Europol in order to ensure that the rights of individuals are not violated by the storage , processing and utilisation of data held . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for that answer . #% As was mentioned earlier today , Veronique De Keyser and I had the honour to meet the President of Palestine last night . #% I am satisfied from discussions I had just yesterday that the 1998 out-turn may be even somewhat stronger than that . #% The proposal from the Council , the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot . #% Many individuals , even in the village down the road from me , are still out of their homes . #% There are many concerns for his safety : some believed he had been kidnapped , others that he was a relative of Lord Lucan . #% I can make this programme available to you . #% That made a very deep impression on me because it made me realize just how important the European Union 's work on human rights is , and the effect of often quite small amounts of money , especially the effect they can have on developing democracy in countries which are suffering from a lack of human rights . #% I have no doubt that an increase would be wrong , but no doubt the Spanish and Portuguese fishing interests would argue the other way . #% But let us never forget that the fundamental right is to live in peace without fear of persecution . #% Exhaustive documentary evidence from Mauritania and Senegal confirms the scale of this tragedy . #% I am very pleased to see that the Presidency is able to be present after all . #% That does not mean , of course , that we should not try as hard as we can to encourage the provision of day care and make quality day care available for those who want to use it . #% Finally , I would like to take this opportunity to repeat my appeal to all parties that support the militants waging a violent Jihad to stop their activities immediately . #% The language on the phasing out of agricultural exports subsidies has been substantially watered down , due to EU objections . #% For its part , the Bulgarian Government must take urgent action to deliver tangible results , particularly in the fight against organised crime . #% The fate of our farmers and meat industry , in terms of getting the market moving , depends on getting this started as quickly as possible . #% It is sowing the seeds of its own destruction , because the legislation will allow us to fund the referendum campaign that many in my country have for a very long time been waiting for - the one that gives us the opportunity to remove ourselves entirely from its control . #% But we risk overwhelming the consumer if we label every foodstuff made from products derived from animals fed on GMOs . #% Therefore I voted against this measure which seems designed solely to create a level playing field for the French auction houses , who have had such a concept in place for many years already . #% Mr President , a week ago I was in the small town of Jogeva in Estonia and I witnessed the EU referendum campaign roadshow . #% Does he agree that , instead , financial assistance to the Palestinian authority should be stepped up and that dialogue with a democratically elected government of Israel and a democratically elected Palestinian authority is the best way to move the Middle East peace process forward by emphasizing the good points in the Oslo peace process to all sides in this sad conflict ? #% Last year , the number of counterfeit 500-euro notes rose by ... #% Our proposals therefore make provision for changes to ensure , first , that officials ' careers depend primarily on their demonstrated abilities , their proven performance and their willingness to accept responsibilities and that they should all have the benefit of objective annual appraisal . #% Mr President , I certainly welcome this report and I gave it a lot of support in the Environment Committee . #% Therefore , whilst we fully support the principle of interoperability of toll systems , it is essential that these pioneering British initiatives are not in any way prejudiced . #% We are convinced that progress has been made but we are not yet convinced that this whole programme of reform is going to be implemented . #% There were also individuals from many groups who suffer individual persecution such as Roma and Dalits , sometimes known as untouchables . #% Ultimately , in order to make it more likely that trade policy enjoys the support of both parliamentarians and the wider public , Parliament should in the longer term have codecision powers , not only on the final outcome of any new trade agreement but also crucially on the Commission 's mandate for negotiations . #% This is the area that any committee of inquiry should , and can , examine : the Commission 's carrying out of its supervisory duty in implementing Community law . #% Voters went freely to the polls , men , women , young and old . #% We must tailor-make policies for different-sized SMEs , whether for the one-person tailor or the larger clothing firm . #% In future , we can have a genuine pension savings market of 377 million people , expanding after enlargement to 450 million people . #% I do not believe we are helping those people who are trying to get out by doing nothing and leaving the situation as it is , so they have to clamber into the back of lorries and suffocate and endure torture and misery . #% While some of the nominated Commissioners are competent , others are not . #% 
We should forget the theory , fellow delegates . #% There are increasing levels of unemployment in Germany and France and their economies are in trouble to the extent that neither are able to meet the rules of the Stability Pact . #% There is real concern for the future of our wood industry . #% Then let me re-emphasise the need for a shift in resources to basic health , if our rhetoric is to be translated into effective action . #% We also need to recognise that carers who are in work need leave provision , not just parents . #% Mr President , we would like to congratulate the rapporteur for having brought together two sensitive issues which many of us would prefer not to see linked since the question of security often provides a questionable alibi , feeding the prejudices of those who prefer to restrict asylum and develop a policy of deterrence towards those needing to exercise their individual and fundamental rights . #% The eurozone is already starting to show signs of fraying at the edges . #% I trust that the Council will continue to show the very greatest concern about that country because it needs our help and assistance . #% Domestically , this is most striking in the case of justice and home affairs . #% Is information needed in the Member States and locally rather than in Brussels ? #% These initiatives concerned three teethers which are made in China , which brought the issue to the attention of the public and the authorities all over Europe . #% It is for Member State Governments to decide , and rightly so . #% Where there was formerly scrutiny by an independent body , there is now scrutiny by a parliamentary body . #% I have myself been approached on similar cases , particularly in relation to the exclusion of pension rights from being fully protected under the Acquired Rights Directive , as in the case of a company in Boreham Wood in my constituency . #% Mr President , our debate today reveals a continuing difficulty at the heart of the European Union 's approach on foreign policy . #% However , as I would like to see this report developed into a successful one , I have to contradict what some of my colleagues have already said about a fair balance of traditions and cultures in industrial relations across the European Union . #% If Pakistan is to continue to receive military aid from EU countries for counter-insurgency operations against terrorist jihadis , and also EU economic assistance , it must give cast-iron guarantees that such aid will not be diverted to strengthening its conventional forces on the Indian border . #% It is not so that you can necessarily represent your own views in whatever manner you choose . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , I find this absolutely fascinating ! #% The ACP Sugar Protocol countries supplied tropical sugar when Europe needed it . #% I strongly support the resolution to provide GBP 150 million of additional funding . #% Commissioner , can you tell the House , has the Commission being putting forward specific proposals for the use of some of this money on projects to improve sanitation in developing nations ? #% Faced with the challenges that we see to our east and to our south , is it really satisfactory that the European Union should not have the same capacity to involve itself in the political process , to reform countries where there is no democracy , that we have given to the United Nations ? #% Until recently the focus has been on ensuring that Muslims behave in accordance with Islam . #% However , if it is handled badly , it will seriously damage the Union . #% What credibility does this give the EU at home or abroad , either for effectively combating terrorism or for upholding human rights ? #% He had lost out on car rental and was forced to use an alternative system , and the car hire company would not participate . #% Throughout this mandate , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has insisted on a proactive approach to the management of industrial change . #% We also have more money in the programme in recognition of its importance . #% Maybe it is still not too late to do something . #% What fellow Members may not know is that the main source of the disease was contaminated pat√© sold from three Belgian plants . #% In Cardiff it is essential that we start the process of building a Europe-wide equity market for venture capital and for investment . #% The reference to qualified majority voting to joint actions under the CFSP goes beyond the position of the Socialist Group and the new British Labour Government . #% Of course it is not an issue without contention . #% We warmly welcome Mrs Gebhardt 's to achieve a compromise , which we will support because it is very important . #% I think that also responds to the point raised by Mrs Morgan on that subject . #% I want to highlight some of the dilemmas arising from this proposal from the Commission . #% The forthcoming municipal elections in March 2003 will be a test of the potential for favourable political developments in Belarus , and we hope that observers from this Parliament will be invited . #% If we do not , we will very soon find ourselves back with this problem again . #% The rapporteur states the case very well in his explanatory statement and I can do no more than commend his analysis to colleagues and make a recommendation to adopt . #% This is an idea which has not so much found its time as found us at precisely the right moment . #% Many quite small companies do engage in significant cross-border business and European Court of Justice decisions make it clear that they can do so . #% The way things stand we would have a different regime applying to a person driving a tram to a person driving an urban bus . #% This does not imply that humanitarian organisations should refrain from aiding such people after their proper entry into a Member State - I would very much support that continuing , and certainly being a feature in future - but rather that they have no more right to participate in any illegal act , in our view , than anyone else . #% I should like to ask you to join me in welcoming into the public gallery Helga Stevens , from the European Union for the deaf , who is observing this vote on behalf of the 500 000 profoundly deaf people within the European Union , as we vote to reaffirm this Parliament 's support for the official recognition of their language - sign language - in every Member State of this European Union . #% IATA lost their challenge and no other referral has been made to the European Court of Justice on this matter . #% I know that Sir Leon in particular has made strenuous efforts to bring a balance to world trade from the Commission 's point of view . #% We all , throughout the European institutions - in Parliament , the Council and the Commission - should be doing our best to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years . #% The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee . #% You are going to have a rather unhappy period . #% Mr President , President Barroso 's final proposal for the 2007-2013 financial perspective contains the following , seemingly contradictory , proposals . #% I agree with the report that Member States should make use of the structural funds to support research , development and innovation ( R&D&I ) objectives that target social challenges , with the aim of increasing prosperity in Europe . #% Some Member States of the European Union seem to have no reserves at all . #% They point blank refused to answer the question , treating this Parliament with contempt . #% The same principles must apply to all the candidate countries and also to the countries such as Turkey which have indicated that they wish to join the European Union . #% It is a plea to this Parliament and to the Commission and everyone concerned that there should be sufficient funding to ensure that the Food Safety Authority can do its job . #% My first point is that we should not waver in our continuing commitment to multilateral trade rules . #% We must have a second UN resolution , we must have a clear timetable in order to say inspectors can go on for so long but no further . #% I should like to tell the honourable Member that in respect to Mr Xu , I will convey what he said about the apparently grave condition of that political prisoner to my colleagues in the external relations area . #% We want to make certain in Europe that is not the case working in the opposite direction . #% To Mr Solana , I ask him to consider how easy it was for the Rafah crossing -- supposedly guaranteed by the EU -- to be closed during the recent Israeli actions , together with the legality of Israel withholding customs payments to the Palestinian Authority , guaranteed under the Paris Agreement . #% In particular I want to refer to two areas of policy : the stability pact , where the French were right to call for a delay . #% We also need to ensure that investors are protected and that the right information is communicated to them in a relevant and timely manner . #% in writing . - Russia has to make up its mind : does it aspire to the EU 's common values or not ? #% Before we ban something we should look at the whole picture . #% It was , however , pointed out to me over the weekend that in fact Mr Bossi was the plaintiff in this action and the action was introduced by the other party as a counterclaim . #% 
Mr President , I am not going to speak about lobsters , but I share the interests of the two previous speakers . #% In Laos , members of the Student Democracy Movement have been in jail since 1999 . #% My colleagues and I will therefore be voting against this agreement on principle , but then we do not believe in the European Union either . #% But the most important thing we can do is coordinate our information work . #% Mr President , today is the first day on which you will be applying our new Rules of Procedure . #% It is simply a question of having this Parliament do its job ! #% However , one of the new Rules is less important within the House than outside it . #% I understand there will be a similar request from the Socialists and they will also be requesting the deletion of paragraph 5 , which we also support for similar reasons . #% None of us here would personally enter into a business or private financial agreement without being sure of how and when that obligation would come to an end . #% Normally , in negotiating FTAs , you name the services that you are ready to liberalise . #% Why has it taken so long for this reform to be introduced ? #% I urge colleagues in the vote tomorrow to give protection to our citizens now . #% The single farm payment requires farmers to produce the goods demanded by the marketplace . #% That would help anchor expectations within the market , as well as fulfilling the important accountability mandate of the ECB . #% Britain under the Labour Government is leading the battle to beat the millennium bug in Europe with its ground-breaking Action 2000 campaign . #% However , the different implementation methods of Member States have made it difficult for the service sector to take full advantage of the directive . #% If they were , they were saying nothing . #% Secondly , we are acutely aware that the results of the financial perspective discussions have left us with fewer resources than we might otherwise have hoped , and therefore lead to the need for prioritisation in the way in which we shape our policies . #% Along with Greece and Portugal , Spain 's membership of the European Community was an early example of the way in which Europe could help encourage and support a new democracy - a path followed successfully by many others since 1989 . #% Some of us live in hope . #% Within the annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice , this particular debate should go forward as well . #% I am sure we will debate this in the future . #% The point that I made to Mrs Gradin , which I am sure she completely understands - especially since I explained in full in my most recent letter , simply relates to that legal reality and the proper discharge of the functions of the Commission as a legally constituted organisation with obligations set down in law in the form of the Staff Regulations . #% From my accent I am sure you will not be surprised by my question . #% Mr President , during our last session , and after depositing documents with the Serious Fraud Office in London , I advised this House that I had called on the British Government to withhold all future funding of the European Union on the grounds that the British Parliament has never voted to pass public money to third parties who can not be trusted to account for it properly . #% We probably are the most Euro-sceptic according to a survey conducted on behalf of the European Union published two weeks ago . #% We should adopt new rules on jurisdiction which trust consumers to make an informed choice about which jurisdiction they want to opt for . #% We call this the `` Whisky and Soda '' reform in Britain , not because it was conceived in some drunken evening in SANCO but because those are the names of Commissioner Patten 's two dogs which for many years he had to leave behind in France when came back to England and he was the principal sufferer - certainly in terms of publicity - who has brought about perhaps a change of thinking in our part of the world . #% Clearly , the construction sector is vital for the European economy , and we have a responsibility to the industry to help support it , especially after the economic crisis . #% So my question is : how can we strengthen policing in Europe in the fight against the use and the distribution of drugs ? #% As always , the Community 's ambitions are bigger than our pockets . #% As far as Mr Coveney is concerned , I would say , on behalf of my group , that we would not like to see a postponement of this resolution . #% It assumes that owner-drivers do not know what is in their own best interests . #% But , seven years on , what has happened ? #% in writing . - British Conservative MEPs fully support a policy of equal opportunity and non-discrimination of women in all areas of public and commercial life . #% I am sure this Parliament will respond enthusiastically to this news as it is exactly what we were pressing for . #% Eurobarometer showed that only 6 % of EU citizens thought they knew a lot about the EU . #% The problem is that the five European Parliament elections that have so far taken place since 1979 have not included one particular part of the European Union . #% I recognise and welcome the Commissioner 's commitment to a subgroup on governance and human rights for Pakistan . #% Also , I was personally concerned to hear last weekend that two serving policemen were found to be part of the mob that physically attacked a pro-Yushchenko rally . #% The outgoing United Kingdom ambassador , William Patey , has indicated that Iraq is already in an undeclared civil war . #% Could the EPP Group please get its act together ! #% The French and Dutch have scuppered the project , yet you go on as if this never happened . #% Above all , with a 36-year phase-in period where there is major investment , I believe that no dockworkers currently working in Harwich , Felixstowe or Tilbury need have their jobs affected for their lifetime . #% Well , I , and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it . #% We also need a stronger emphasis on EU programmes for research and development in these sectors in particular . #% Finally , Latin America is Europe 's strategic partner . #% That was not a bad answer ! #% It should not have happened and the fact that it did did not help Parliament 's budget one iota . #% We need much stronger measures to combat this scourge , and my party , the British Conservatives , will even accept the appointment of a counter-terrorist coordinator if this can be shown to improve security . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , no bilateral relationship is more important to us than that with the United States . #% At the end of the day , we really need to reduce production and sort out the demand for chicken meat . #% But other actions are possible , such as the more general extension of health and safety legislation to the self-employed suggested in Mr P√©rez √Ålvarez 's Amendment No 4 . #% Only with effective , functioning democratic institutions can the Palestinians lay the foundations for their own state , living in peace with Israel . #% After all we have a common foreign and security policy not because we want some sort of status symbol to prove to the rest of the world we have grown up as an organization , but because we believe that our economic and political strength can , through CFSP , produce benefits not only to EU citizens but to citizens of the broader Europe and , indeed , of the world , and it is on providing those positive benefits that we have to be judged . #% I can , therefore , say with some authority that I strongly welcome it . #% We spend so much time dealing with expenditure that we have to prioritize the proper collection of own resources as a major , fundamental and integral part of the budget procedure . #% If anyone is culpable for this morning it is not you , Mr President , it is not the demonstrators , it is not the Members of this House , it is Mrs Green for putting us in an impossible situation . #% The cost of this programme over five years is only what we give as subsidies to tobacco growers in one year . #% This is a good example of the synergy of regional and research funds coming together . #% We must not relax our drive against corruption . #% Of course , I , like all members of my group , call for fair trials for all those detained . #% This again goes to show just how important a role regional advisory councils can play . #% It calls on all parties to respect Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military agreements and undertakings in full and hopes that complete KFOR and UNMIK deployment will be completed without great delay . #% My family has been associated with Lloyd 's for over 200 years in one form or another and I therefore understand the marketplace and how Lloyd 's functions . #% You also say how temporary work is flourishing in the Netherlands . #% 
I would also be interested to have his view on that aspect . #% My sources tell me that DG Development at its highest level -- that probably means you , Commissioner -- is very worried about the capacity of the secretariat of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community in their negotiations . #% Indeed , one of the many reasons why the Treaty of Amsterdam left so much to be desired was its total failure to get to grips with this challenge . #% In that letter I also made clear beyond doubt that my letter of 22 November was not in any way an attempt to limit free comment or to prevent criticism of the Commission either by Mrs Gradin , or indeed by Mr Asp or anyone else . #% The EU 's own social inclusion strategy recognises the links , for example , between poor housing , poor health and poor educational attainment . #% The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that it is imperative to conclude the IGC before the end of 2000 in order to leave the EU fully prepared for enlargement . #% Madam President , this is exactly the same point of order . #% Secondly , that it was up to the people of Zimbabwe , with the support of their African neighbours - and here I name South Africa in particular of course - to bring about the necessary change . #% He is , of course , a victim , but there is another casualty and that is the state of human rights and civil liberties within the EU . #% We feel that this element is too weak in the current proposals . #% With those few comments , I support the Elles report and once again congratulate the Presidency for the work it has done in politicizing this important process . #% We should take this opportunity , and indeed every opportunity , to put into practice our belief that wherever possible we should be applying strictly the principles of subsidiarity and making sure that when we take measures on behalf of the environment at European Union level it is because they will genuinely make a difference to individuals and can not be done by individual Member States . #% Mr President , it is high time that we resolved this complex and long-standing issue once and for all . #% Again , that will be a very demanding challenge . #% It has helped to convince firstly the Commission , and then even the minority on the Council which was reluctant to go along with this . #% It was also regrettable , in my mind , that Turkey recently invited to the OIC Summit in Istanbul President Bashir of Sudan , a man indicted by the International Criminal Court for the horrors of Darfur . #% Mr President , are you telling me that the ruling was that paragraph 89 , as written , was in any event admissible ? #% It seems to be a low police priority in most Member States . #% I would also like to congratulate him on the way he has never failed to take forward the human rights agenda during his term as President-in-Office . #% I know the Commission and the Council have listened and I believe they will have benefited because we are working together on this measure . #% The Commission consequently advised the Council that the suspension of the infringement procedure could no longer be justified . #% We also need to demonstrate that in Vienna there is a commitment to reconnecting the people of Europe with the project of the European Union . #% It has not started well on the institutional front , with Chancellor Sch√ºssel 's quite ill-informed attack on the Court of Justice . #% I have already raised this matter on two occasions on the floor of this House , on 4 February and 11 March , and our urgency resolution reflects the desperate seriousness of the continuing crisis . #% With strength , Madam President , I say yes , yes , yes , to all the questions asked by Mr van Hulten and I say it with joy . #% Concerns are raised about multiannual funding of projects . #% Reform will be difficult and fraught with risk , but as the United Kingdom , under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s and Spain under Mr Aznar in the 1990s proved , a resolute approach to economic reform delivers results . #% Therefore , we need now to look not only at Turkey 's ability to join the Union , but also at our ability to absorb it . #% I have a suspicion that the President-in-Office is personally in favour of transparency . #% He must be given a fair trial in full accordance with international fair trial standards or released forthwith . #% What concerns me is that the former two still have some way to go , in my opinion , before they can join the Union . #% Mr President , I am delighted that this morning we are debating three strong reports on consumer protection and that they straddle so many different committees . #% We must stop claiming that over-regulation means safer roads . #% The same thing applies to travel allowances established in the 1950s on the basis of the first-class rail fare of an official at least once a year , or even twice a year , to their home country . #% We must be self-disciplined and make sure that problem does not arise . #% It was hoped that the low inflation rates and improving levels of growth in Latin America would provide the basis for real progress and , as Mr Bangemann said , in 1997 the average rate of growth was over 5 % . #% In the quite proper debate on concentration , these points must not be lost . #% Let us not add football spectators to those people who do not understand what Europe is about . #% I concur with Mr Lechner that the rules that formerly governed this are some 25 years old ; they are complicated and out of date . #% I am not sure we have exactly the right answer yet , but it is clear that the material holdings provisions need to be altered . #% Parliament is poised to adopt the decisions setting up the network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community . #% Mr President , this really is a very sorry tale , though I want to thank you and the Commissioner for at least allowing us to have that statement before we had the debate . #% That has to be the right way forward . #% India and Pakistan have carried on this conflict for over fifty years now . #% The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form . #% In fact , you resemble Alec Guinness in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai , doing completely the wrong thing for what you think is the right reason . #% Madam President , I support and , indeed , salute Mr Cabrol for the breadth of experience , knowledge and compassion that he has always brought to this subject . #% It is very important that we do this to underpin civil dialogue . #% I thank the Commissioner for that very helpful answer . #% Finally , I have one or two questions for the Commissioner because I am quite sure that you are a wise political manoeuvrer , Commissioner Schreyer . #% The trouble is we do not know how to use it . #% We will have to address this issue . #% Do you accept that for legislation in a democratic environment , in which we are in the European Union , the public , whom the laws affect , should be able to see and hear what their elected representatives are doing to pass the laws ? #% Bulgaria must prove that she is able to implement the requirements the Commission has issued in its progress report in order to avoid any activation of safeguard clauses . #% That worry has been accentuated by the case of Emily Lau , who has been involved in dispute for nearly 12 months with the New China News Agency . #% As others have said , we should recognise the importance of this agreement because it is the first legislative instrument to be passed at European level on legal immigration . #% Mr President , the fight against international terrorism is the EU 's greatest challenge . #% The situation is even worse if you are male graduate of Bangladeshi or Pakistani background ; your employment chances are as good as those of a young white man with no qualifications whatsoever . #% We also have an EU Treaty obligation to better integrate these fields . #% We need to influence and improve the way Egypt operates in this field . #% Since that press release , my office staff have had injury added to insult by receiving a lot of emails from supporters of the UK Independence Party , or its members , which have been frankly offensive and inflammatory in the extreme , including one suggestion that it should have been a bigger bomb . #% We do not blame the Commission for the fact that their consultants failed . #% I am asked to pay the same taxes , to live by the same laws , but both I and my relationship - which can not be recognised in the United Kingdom - are denied equality . #% The British Government , now considering a similar request , should tell the Russians that , on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in the EU , we recognise the considered Danish decision and refuse his extradition to Russia . #% This is so important because today , that is the way in which we fight organised crime . #% If it proposes progressive policies to stimulate economic growth , to deal with climate change , to strengthen individual freedom and responsibility , and to encourage cooperation on the world stage where we share common interests , all of these are areas where Europe can offer a benefit rather than impose a burden . #% 
I was proud of the EU when it imposed sanctions on Austria when the new coalition formed because of the views and actions of the Freedom Party : a party whose policies have xenophobia running through them like Blackpool through rock ; a leader who has praised Hitler and the Waffen SS , refused to condemn terrorist bombings against Roma and congratulates Nazi war veterans for keeping to their principles . #% It is important that the rights of the citizen to complain to the Ombudsman about alleged maladministration should be more widely publicized , as should the right of the citizen and resident to submit petitions to the European Parliament on other matters that concern the sphere of responsibility of the European Communities and the respective responsibilities and duties of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions . #% Now it is the Parliament 's turn to assess the action plan . #% Alongside George Speight and his gang , when the people 's coalition government were taken hostage on 19 May , were members of the armed forces ' counter-revolutionary warfare unit . #% On that basis , we were prepared to accept that the immunity should be maintained . #% We truly live now in an interdependent world and must reform ourselves to meet these new circumstances . #% One might hope that this report will make it easier for that account and similar accounts elsewhere in Europe to be frozen if that was proven necessary . #% It is not acceptable that , for nearly a decade , the EU has failed to produce a budget that is capable of being signed off by its own auditors , and that over 80 % of the EU budget is not properly accounted for . #% So you may have your diversion today , Commissioner , but the EU is failing , public confidence is falling and it will all end in tears . #% I thank everyone for their contributions to the debate , welcoming every single contribution . #% People in recognised stable relationships that meet these requirements will be entitled to the family-related benefits that , under present Staff Regulations , are available only to heterosexual married couples and to officials who are homosexuals and of Dutch nationality . #% The position of the UK Government is sadly both reckless and irresponsible , and it is also illegal . #% First of all , for some of the accession countries , the question of financial provision is a very difficult one . #% What is wrong , I ask , with encouraging trade in these services when it helps the poorest ? #% I am concerned that there is still under-reporting elsewhere in the European Union and we have to make sure that this is seen as a European problem and not just a British one . #% It can meet the standards and it wants a competitive advantage over those who have not done the same . #% It is a question of those who either did not properly participate in the debate , or those who , having participated , found their views rejected , now wanting to have a second bite of the cherry . #% These are not just legal problems , President-in-Office , but a profound political crisis which we must address . #% However , we could not support any extension of Commission competence , which could frustrate the overwhelming case for Member States to determine when there is a need for heightened security measures in their own territories . #% Nevertheless , I am pleased that Hamas is now starting new truce talks with Prime Minister Abbas . #% I am pleased that you explained to us the range of studies that you have commissioned , including impact assessment . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - In March , the European Commission announced it would conduct another review of the Working Time Directive , after the previous review fell . #% Many speakers have commented on how important it is to recognise that it would be crazy to try to implement universal standards . #% In the vote on the previous report you always identified the group which called for the roll call vote , which caused some discomfort for our colleagues in the Green Group . #% The lessons for us are clear and the amendments which Mrs G√ºnther has referred to reflect the concerns we have about our work with South African partners . #% The rapporteur says there is no immediate prospect of therapies being available to patients ; if he gets this restrictive deadline reinstated , he may be right . #% Agreeing a research project , funding it , undertaking it and then having it validated by ECVAM , endorsed by the Scientific Committee and incorporated into Annex 5 requires that sort of timescale . #% I understood that we were looking now at an upper limit of around 20 % , instead of the 40 % and 50 % we sometimes see . #% Mr President , I would like to give colleagues a short update on where we stand on this important proposal . #% I want to remind all of you here , and everyone listening to this debate , that there are hundreds of thousands , maybe even millions of people across the European Union working on inventions that have been protected by patents . #% The next revision of the European Treaty must remedy this deficit . #% We need the progressive forces of this House - and I say this to people like Mr van Velzen and to others - to unite after the vote tomorrow to work with the new European Commission so that we can actually make progress , because we have had nine months of stagnation . #% When I talk about words , I am thinking about words like `` bench-marking '' and `` peer review '' . #% The European Parliament 's report favours unconditional rights for Eurostat to do so-called methodological visits . #% That must be a priority for us , but it must not be a priority which destroys the rest of our health work . #% The NGOs from the EU and African countries took this summit very seriously and it was a missed opportunity not to engage in more meaningful dialogue with them . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , thank you for introducing us to this first budgetary debate for 2007 . #% I wish to point out that subsidies for tobacco production not only go to the very poorest Members of the European Union but also to countries like France , Germany and Austria , which have among the highest income per head within the Union . #% Otherwise it would have the right to choose no option whatsoever and to completely ignore the objections made by Parliament , which would be thoroughly undemocratic . #% I hope this will restore consumer confidence in beef , especially after the BSE crisis . #% Secondly , what is being done to ensure that the staff at Brussels airport does not restrict the movement of those new-slot airlines as a result of picketing and delays at the airport ? #% I hope that my pessimistic prognosis , which echoes that of the Commission 's own , proves to be wrong over time . #% They would prefer to be on the same floor as the plenary session and maybe we could actually look into that . #% Similarly , such an underlying budget balance would discourage finance ministers from fiscal easing in upturns , merely on account of cyclically buoyant revenue . #% The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument -- which will replace the existing Tacis and Meda programmes in 2007 -- is , in my view , essential to budgetary discipline and procedure . #% That is illustrated by those who oppose the supremacy of Union law over the law of Member States , which is after all the current situation . #% I am grateful to the Commissioner for his balanced response . #% We also know that the situation is not as simple as some speakers this morning seem to think it is . #% Perhaps she could withdraw from violence by making her intifada a peaceful one . #% Hopefully the impending referendum scheduled for South Sudan , which will create a new sovereign state in the south , will provide fresh motivation for all the parties involved to seek a final resolution to this long-standing dispute over Western Sahara - a territory and a people which , in my mind , deserve a peaceful and prosperous future . #% It also says that political parties at Union level contribute to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union . #% in writing . - Concerning the vote on the resolution on the Ehler Report , Labour MEPs were happy to be able to give their support . #% This is a welcome step . #% We looked at ways to cover the following important areas : the nature of voluntary work and administrative , financial , linguistic and cultural obstacles to mobility . #% It is simply through the conciliation procedure that a first-class piece of law will be created . #% The progress has perhaps not been as significant as some would have wished , but there are improvements to be celebrated nevertheless . #% Job creation should not be about creating jobs for former Prime Ministers to be President of the Council , or for globetrotting aficionados to be High Representatives for Foreign Affairs . #% I am not aware that Ms Ahern or Mrs Morgantini are members of the PPE-DE Group . #% I hope that all the people who signed up to that agreement , on the Pact for Stability and Growth , will honour it as it is written and that there will be no rearguard action either by members of the Monetary Committee or the Central Bankers or , indeed , any particular Finance Minister from any major Member State in the European Union to undermine the compromise that was reached in Dublin on that pact . #% Mr President , I am going to raise a few points , but my main point is on smoking , again . #% Although politically I have no sympathy whatsoever with Jesse Helms , as an elected politician I do have some sympathy with the rights of people who are elected to put forward legislation which they feel reflects the views of their own voters . #% I am grateful to the Independent newspaper in the United Kingdom for raising this , and it is extremely important that people are made aware of this issue , because of the work that UCLAF is doing . #% Resolutions and words , albeit well-intentioned , seem to achieve little . #% I have two questions for the Commissioner to which I would like , if possible , an answer : if the UK unilaterally bans beef coming into the United Kingdom from which the risk material has not been removed , can the Commissioner invoke article 169 and take it before the Court of Justice ? #% It is going to deal with all the TSEs and that includes scrapie . #% The Allies will install a representative government and must prevent refugees flowing out and instability in the region , as well as facilitating the return of the Iraqi diaspora to rebuild their country in safety . #% 
I understand the sensitivity of it but I am sure you are aware of the mounting concern which this directive is causing in the UK and elsewhere and which has , in fact , been stoked by very critical media and television articles . #% This disease is not only a women 's issue , as Mr Bowis and Mrs Z√°borsk√° have said . #% Reform is not the solution . #% This is essential because , not only is there an enormous music industry and film industry , we must not forget the highly successful computer games industry which is generating a huge amount of revenue in the United Kingdom and in a number of other countries across the EU . #% I very much support those measures outlined in the report which would help prevent any further outbreak of FMD which devastated farming communities across the country and in my own region of Yorkshire and the Humber . #% All we seek in this context is for our islands to enjoy access to the single market on equal terms with mainland regions . #% Those of us who insisted that the levels suggested in the first edition of the report were unworkable won the day . #% She spoke of the scandal of abuse of safety . #% There is a great deal to do , and it will require substantial funding from our programmes in developing countries . #% We see that there is potential for a dramatic renewal of the transatlantic alliance , and here the partnership between the EU and the USA plays the most fundamental role . #% Her mistake was to marry a Frenchman and go and live in France where she has been refused employment as a teacher despite having considerable experience of teaching . #% If tonight you could give a commitment that you are willing to do that then certainly in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy of the European Parliament we will try and take up those ideas and work with you to develop them . #% I would have like to have seen a specific disability directive that outlawed discrimination in access to goods and services and similarly one on age . #% The Commission did their best to make sure that they were not disadvantaged but the tactic that has been adopted by Parliament is to be commended . #% We need to be surrounded by a ring of friends who enjoy free markets , security within their borders and shared values with the European Union , particularly on human rights and democracy-building . #% I would like to return , if I may , to the issue of lawyers as lobbyists , which Mr Turmes has just raised . #% The other issue that this Parliament is working on this week is human trafficking and violence against women . #% Rather , the best solution to the matters and problems he raises is to decide on the particular procedures , processes and mechanisms needed to handle most effectively the particular issues concerned and then to define and describe the workings of the European Union in that way . #% The British Conservatives support the oral question and resolution on the common organisations of the markets in sugar . #% What does concern me in the proposal from the Commission for the office in Ireland was the discovery that the Commission had already leased a working area in Dublin , outside the normal places of work of the European Union , for workers whose recruitment had not yet been approved - a fact made even more reprehensible by the existing agreement to freeze staff numbers within the Commission . #% That meant a lot of us had to fly via Nantes and did not arrive until 9 p.m. . #% This is why such importance has been given to training in this report , to the extent perhaps of widening the framework directive 's interpretation of training and that is a welcome move . #% He faces defeat in the presidential election next year , but is trying to head this off with a savage campaign of brutal intimidation against his political opponents . #% We are already witnessing in European winter resorts in the mountains the effects of the rising snow line , but the long-term prospects are far more frightening . #% Over 20 of these amendments are contradictory , so they can not possibly all be the position of the EPP Group . #% Certainly of the people who took an Erasmus course in 1998 and bothered to reply to the questionnaire 98 % found that the programme was extremely positive or at least very positive . #% It also requires the European Parliament to extend its own scope to the defence field , especially when the Western European Union Assembly is closed down , so that proper democratic scrutiny of this sensitive and controversial field will be provided . #% I would like your assurance that any information that goes out to Member States in which there are going to be referendums presents both sides of the argument , so that we can have a free and fair result . #% I always deal honestly and openly with all my colleagues , but he flattered me privately and failed to act publicly . #% Someone should tell Mrs Wallstr√∂m ... #% Because they have been told this by people who should know better , including some in this chamber who are willing to deliberately mislead the public in pursuit of their political goals . #% Yet , lost at the bottom of the hole , starts Mrs Theato , who declares in her explanatory statement that ` it has long been acknowledged that the Communities ' financial interests require special protection under criminal law ' . #% This is an extraordinarily important report . #% We would like to see that taken forward in a realistic and practical way . #% I also commend that element of this report to the House . #% It we can find that out we are on the way to a better scrutiny of the products themselves . #% I thank colleagues in other parties for working with me to try and ensure that Parliament 's position commands a large majority . #% We can not invite people to the European Union only to say `` pay your taxes here , but do not expect any social services or social benefits in return '' . #% This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war . #% I welcome both the summit and the action plan as a wake-up call to our governments . #% We have a system of own resources that is extremely complex and lacking in transparency . #% I think the presidency would agree that we have made much progress towards a common system . #% Perhaps the Quaestors could take up this issue of why we are getting Fair Trade tea in one case but not in another , and consider what more we can do in this House with regard to buying Fair Trade produce . #% In European waters , 2 000 containers a year are lost at sea , and this figure would appear to be rising year on year . #% I have trees in my garden , I have planted trees in my garden and I like to see trees when I am driving around . #% Mr Ortuondo Larrea and others referred to flags . #% We also know that we increasingly seem to be seeing the development of death squads along the lines we are familiar with in South America . #% Mr President , I rise to speak on the competition report introduced by my colleague , Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen , to whom I offer my congratulations on the quality of her work . #% The answers , in maintaining current security of supply and developing efficient non-carbon based energy , are not mutually exclusive . #% That is the immutable principle in the defence of human rights and universal freedoms . #% That interpretation is shared by the other institutions and has been the practice for a number of years . #% To ensure that people could not vote twice - because they could vote , in most cases , anywhere - there was a magic marker put on their finger . #% Yet if they pause to think for one minute they would soon realise that their own country , every country , probably loses more from the vetoes cast by other countries than they gain in using their own in many areas of European Union responsibility . #% We are thinking in the old world here - some of our colleagues are thinking in the old world . #% It refers to an incident where Mr Bossi actually used physical violence . #% Realism is necessary today to prevent bitter disappointment and disillusionment tomorrow . #% A decade ago , everybody said that once we had the euro currency , it would bring us stability . #% However , we can not support the calls in this resolution for the implementation of the EU Constitution , the calls for a Common EU Immigration , Visa and Asylum Policy or the assertion that the EU has insufficient funds to deal with future challenges . #% Here we welcome the setting up of the European Coordination Centre for Aviation Incident Reporting . #% I have been criticised by allegedly greener Members for doing this and for not being sufficiently ambitious by supporting the target limits proposed in the Annex . #% We must be outward-looking in this Parliament . #% To that effect , I ask that a suitable definition be inserted into or attached to the regulations so as to ensure that this lifeline , along with many others , is not forced out of business . #% With regard to the European Parliament 's lease of the Strasbourg parliament buildings , we acknowledge and approve the fact that the report states that the parliament authority behaved correctly but that the City of Strasbourg had failed to act in good faith . #% They only had four days notice and asked for it to be postponed until a later date . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by paying tribute to Commissioner Verheugen , because it is down to his industry and determination that we are so close to grasping the prize of the reunification of Europe . #% Maybe you can help to fix some of the criticisms of EPLA . #% 
Mr President , we are surrounded by chemicals in our everyday lives . #% Mr President , for more than a year we in Parliament 's negotiating teams , together with the Commission and the Council of Ministers , have been struggling with a puzzle . #% Mr President , the tragedy of the Arab-Israeli conflict is never too far from our minds or TV screens , and the carefully constructed roadmap now seems to have virtually imploded . #% Why is the Commission giving Spain such an easy time ? #% Romania continues to comply with the criterion of being a functioning market economy , but there are still concerns on state aid and bankruptcy laws . #% Mr President , I would like to start by adding my thanks and congratulations to the rapporteur . #% I understand that at some stage the Commission will be coming back with proposals on that . #% Those directives reflect the more positive dimension of the European Union and people need to be aware of their rights . #% It is not accurate or helpful , therefore , to describe their difficulties with the USA as a transatlantic rift between the EU and the United States . #% There must be a European Parliament delegation to Northern Cyprus . #% We are reasonably and sensibly seeking to ensure compatibility between schemes . #% We understand that we can not accelerate the procedure so that we come first on the list of subjects for debate , so we will debate this , as usual in a crowded House , at about 11.15 tonight . #% Reform is not something that can be simply addressed as one issue among many in a new multilateral trade round where it risks being traded off against other interests and demands . #% We want a Commission which works , which really does less better . #% That means that civil society and Members of this House and other elected representatives need to be properly and fully involved . #% Does that mean that there is no legitimate interest in members from other countries participating in those national debates ? #% Just as a quick reminder , the batch that was brought forward last year by the Commission included first of all an overall amendment of the 1993 directive , that is the subject of Mrs Smet ' s report ; a directive on road transport , sadly that one is totally blocked in the Transport Council at the moment I understand it ; the third , a directive implementing the agreement between the social partners on seafarers , was adopted in the form of a directive in June this year so that element is taken care of , and then finally the proposal that I am speaking on today , a directive on the enforcement of working hours on board ships using Community ports . #% People in the United Kingdom are particularly interested in fuel economy because of the punitive fuel tax levels set by our Labour Government , which particularly pose problems for people living in rural areas like my own where public transport is often non-existent . #% How many of you realised that you were accepting them ? #% Today , under the different heading of reform of competition policy I find that I am confronted with exactly the same thing - yet another attempt by the Commission to achieve the gradual integration of national systems . #% Here again we welcome the action being taken by the Secretary-General . #% There are different , innovative ways to face the challenges of increasing global competition . #% This development has been facilitated by the lack of any permanent settlement in the Gulf to guarantee Kurdish rights in the long run . #% So I feel I need to respond by making it clear - as I did in my speech - that I have always supported diplomatic solutions to this problem . #% As a past Minister for Immigration and Asylum in the United Kingdom , I am well aware that the confusion with regard to determining which country should deal with any particular application has been an immense problem and one that has created a considerable level of friction between Members of the European Union . #% The greatest fear has to be long-term destabilisation , not just in Montenegro , not just in Macedonia , but further abroad , including the effect on Greece and Italy for example . #% I am , of course , delighted on behalf of our group to welcome the fact that Taiwanese citizens will soon be able to enter the Schengen zone without needing a visa - also known in EU jargon terms as a visa liberalisation for Taiwan . #% The British Conservatives voted in favour of the Watson report in order to underline our continued ongoing support for the war against terrorism , and to confirm our determination to ensure that the European Union presents a united front against those who seek to undermine our values and our way of life . #% Are you going to interfere with Great Britain ' s Parliament if we are elected ? #% The whole thing is fatally flawed , is it not ? #% Where is the call for political solidarity and enhanced cooperation among all the democracies ? #% In recent weeks , I have been impressed by the statements by the President of the Commission and his clear aim of putting growth and prosperity at the heart of his strategy for the period ahead . #% The particulate limits are as tight as is feasible and will require the fitting of diesel particulate filters across the range of Euro 5 diesel passenger cars , and that will deliver major air quality benefits . #% Here we are half way through the programme and we see high unemployment , sclerotic growth and not a cat 's chance in hell of any of the Lisbon Agenda being realised . #% It is a huge compliment to the EU that its achievement in evolving from a Common Market of six countries to a Union of 15 democratic states is such that the states of Central and Eastern Europe , having acquired the freedom to choose , have chosen to apply for membership . #% As soon as possible that aid needs to be delivered on the ground . #% Restoring public confidence means getting security screening right and improving the quality of staff , training , job procedures , pay and conditions . #% We have already had a hearing on this and we have our research report . #% It really is about time that the people of Brussels discovered how irritating this interfering trivia could be . #% We have been told the Commission has a legal obligation to press ahead with this legislation . #% This has to be addressed and I am sure Mr McCartin appreciates that . #% Compare this with 1992 : the years of preparation , the number of separate pieces of legislation , the final and general excitement to welcome the free market in goods . #% We will publicise the EPP position and their amendments whether they are passed or not . #% But I seek clarification on Amendment No 1 . #% The Belgian police confirm that it was not the Commission but myself who called in the police . #% We know that the government is struggling , but we also recognise that it needs our support in terms of developing democracy within Pakistan , not least in the political battle against extremism and for universal human rights , and it is our role as democratic parliamentarians to support all those who are working for positive change and to give them the voice that others would deny them . #% Mr President , of course this resolution speaks for itself . #% I was looking only this morning at recent reports by NGOs about how banditry continues and how the difficulties of delivering humanitarian aid are exacerbated by this situation . #% It proposes that we establish for ourselves our fundamental rights regime at the centre of the integration process so that it will stand as a jewel in the crown of our future constitution . #% Therefore the minimum that we want , if we are to accept this flawed concept of safe third countries , is a unified list decided under codecision with Parliament , which would be a step towards a common asylum policy . #% The Member is quite right , it is a question of moderation . #% Madam President , no one with the slightest concern about human rights can possibly be other than horrified by the savage murders and devastating atrocities perpetrated in Algeria over the course of the last five years . #% We all very much hope that in six months ' time in Gothenburg , once again , it will not only be Sweden 's day , but Europe 's day . #% There are some in the Council who think that we are not being particularly generous in leaving it at a cut of 50 % . #% Madam President , this proposal will probably succeed as a transitional measure to regularise what is at present a flawed system of financing our fledgling political parties . #% Secondly , we appeal for free access to the ICTY 's archives by prosecutors , defence counsel and , eventually , historians and researchers . #% We are not talking here about something being forced on people , we are talking about something being requested because there is a clear need and demand for it . #% in writing . - British Conservatives have been unable to approve discharge of the 2007 European budget , section III , European Commission . #% My strong advice to the presidency would be to reject such superfluous complications . #% We all know that Hungary has been seeking membership of the European Union since 1989 . #% I also wonder whether the Council and Commission have considered revisiting last year 's decision to grant Albanians visa-free travel to the EU in the light of the bloodshed , which may , of course , generate more economic emigration to the Schengen area if foreign direct investment dries up . #% The humanitarian motives referred to in many of the amendments of Mr Ceyhun are , again , very difficult to define or to interpret in a fair and proper manner in a court of law . #% The new cigarette health warnings will cover half the surface of cigarette packs , with warnings 40 % of the packet size on the front and 50 % on the back . #% We have no EU-wide stock of vaccines , and in most countries our quarantine laws are outdated . #% Also , he was kidnapped from an EU country , Italy , against international law . #% That is why my group will be recommending that this is rejected tomorrow . #% 
Zanu-PF has the government resources , and the MDC supporters are too afraid to donate money . #% This report shows the value that a parliamentary committee can bring to a complex issue , particularly one that cuts across so many policy areas . #% Some sort of route map or check list is helpful and desirable . #% But we must not mistake a waved piece of paper for a proper peace . #% It builds on the right to petition , but more than that it is a positive right that allows our citizens to begin to set the agenda . #% You said that under this Presidency legislation in 18 new areas had been worked on and you seem to be proud of that . #% I know colleagues feel very strongly about it but the market will actually cure those issues . #% Secondly I would like to place on record the apologies of our shadow-rapporteur , Mr Rothley , who is unfortunately engaged on other important business . #% We need to raise standards , and we raise standards in the European Union by describing good standards , not prescribing them . #% No aircraft must be allowed into the European Union unless it meets all the safety requirements , and this must also apply to crew . #% The fly in the ointment is the curious decision on the choice of the troika for the praesidium of this Convention . #% That is the language of the Royal Society report in the United Kingdom . #% That had nothing to do with a spirit of cooperation and it certainly did not breed mutual trust . #% You have the overall responsibility for external relations from the Commission 's point of view . #% This is a question that we need to ask . #% Three specific points in the employment and labour market area : first , in relation to quality of work , it would be very useful if you could work with us in Parliament to incorporate amendments on quality indicators into the employment guidelines for 2002 to jump-start the Commission ' s communication on that subject . #% They must pay heed to the work of the Davignon report experts and also the work of Mr Menrad . #% When UKIP vote on this report , it will vote in accordance with the wishes of UK citizens . #% Hizbollah itself makes no such distinction . #% Mr Mitchell 's report draws our attention to the rules that give Member States the responsibility for exchange rate policy , and calls on Eurozone finance ministers to coordinate their influence on the exchange rate with the European Central Bank . #% I hope that this House and the Commission will support the call of the Committee on Women 's Rights for a Europewide campaign against violence to women . #% My concern was to make sure that we respect our Rules of Procedure because they are the foundation of the powers and privileges of this House . #% In Hargeisa unskilled wages are now twice the rate they are in Nairobi . #% I am reminded of a story I once told Mr Liikanen . #% On the basis of what we have seen today , we do not believe that to be the case . #% It inevitably led to misgrading . #% It could be a model for surrounding states like Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan and Tajikistan which maintain authoritarian systems that are only in partial transition . #% We are in a slightly sensitive position in terms of telling them or asking them or assisting them to do things that we want to do , but that they may not be enthusiastic about doing themselves . #% It was in no way because of the resolution presented to this Parliament by Mrs Jackson , which we fully supported . #% If this Parliament decides to go for the soft option we have to follow through if those targets that we set are not actually met . #% So national parliaments are greatly affected by the changes afoot . #% The reasons are obvious : price , competition and the desire to lower the cost to industry , so as to make Europe more competitive against our competitors , both in North America and in Asia . #% We should keep this perspective in mind . #% We are urging the Commission to revise the EU strategy on defending by all means FMD status and to recognise that the culling and destruction of healthy animals is both inhumane and ineffective . #% We have centuries of company law in the UK , thank you very much . #% I absolutely agree that Iraq must observe the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of war , but how hypocritical it is for Rumsfeld to insist on this while denying such protection to those prisoners illegally detained in Guantanamo Bay . #% We must take into account the Scientific Steering Committee ' s review , but surely if the spinal cord is removed adequately that should be enough . #% Ensuring that the PSCs provide a human as well as an electronic contact point is also vital to ensure that users receive all the relevant information and that questions are answered . #% Turkish Cypriots , fully backed by Ankara , supported the United Nations plan which , among other features , would have phased out the non-Cypriot forces from the island , both Turkish and Greek . #% Mr President , I would like to address my remarks primarily to Mr Kellett-Bowman 's report on the satellite agencies . #% 70 % of the population of Rwanda currently are women . #% Equally , lesser clubs in the football league , for example Bury Football Club in my constituency , depend on having matches played against the glamour clubs as well as on the prospect of themselves getting through to the final . #% This certainly leaves the UK lacking credibility in a campaign for mutual raising of standards in the EU . #% We now need minds to open , but , above all , we need action to follow these ideas through . #% They do not accept that everyone has a part to play in the electoral process . #% We have decided to abstain on this report as we are concerned that the long list of demands in it will be used politically by those opposed to Turkey 's membership of the EU . #% I do not want to be too critical , we know only too well as parliamentarians about electoral pressures , but it is worth saying that the pressures in the United States are not so much from the citizens , from the voters , but from the big business backers of both parties and both campaigns and that makes an enormous difference . #% A 40-tonne heavy goods lorry is fully interoperable . #% One of my colleagues , Mr Moreira Da Silva , who will be leading Parliament ' s delegation to Bonn , wishes to move an oral amendment on this point to the resolution we have tabled , since the problem with Japan has really only come to the fore in the period since we tabled it . #% I contributed to the 2001 report and am delighted to say that a number of the ideas that flowed from that are now incorporated in this very welcome Fifth proposal from the Commission . #% Are they going to support the budget line issues ? #% We must have genuine democratic safeguards for Europol . #% Very finally , I fully support what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said about visa-free travel for all EU citizens and we are very critical of a ` visa lite ' fee for the ESTA . #% Almost five years after agreeing on an EU anti-terrorism law , some Member States have still not implemented it . #% Why not tear that one down , replace it with the European flag and see what the Belgian people say ? #% If this information was to be shared across the EU , many third countries would refuse to sign similar agreements in the future . #% Although there were high hopes in the aftermath of the resignation of President Suharto that the way would at last be open to a peaceful resolution of the problems of East Timor , after a quarter of a century of bloodshed in which a third of the population has died as a consequence of the Indonesian invasion of 1975 , those hopes have not been fulfilled . #% It follows that the UK Independence Party regards this report with suspicion . #% On account of the above-mentioned agreements , the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his country of origin results in much more complex procedures , a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place , and higher costs than if the death had occurred in the deceased person 's country of origin . #% On the other hand , the possibility of having nationally based courts of first instance and a panel of judges , with at least one who is technically qualified and at least two who are legally qualified and from different Member States , might be superior to the current ECJ arrangements , were they to apply to a Community patent . #% We will be voting ` no ' tomorrow . #% Our role is , therefore , to flank the WTO with other supporting agreements in other fields , notably the environmental field . #% This report goes some way towards that , but it is part of a much wider picture working towards a common European asylum system with a separate immigration system alongside it . #% . British Conservatives sympathise with the victims of the summer forest fires . #% We have to move on from the old excuses , the legal challenges mounted by IATA and the opposition to even modest voluntary agreements which we still hear on some sides . #% The problem is that the report disappoints with sins of both omission and commission . #% 
Madam President-in-Office , you reminded us of those areas where we did get agreement in the trialogues , about the letters of amendment in the autumn , about the commitment appropriations in the Structural Funds and about what our clear priorities should be . #% We will make that positive case , because we want the jobs and the new business start-ups . #% Finally , I welcome what might be called the holistic approach of the Barcelona process - its multidimensional nature . #% That is the key point . #% In these circumstances , will there not come a time when , although no deadline has been set , further action will have to be taken to protect European businessmen from the effects of this situation . #% What is now known as the disability movement is building across our continent to work for the day when the 37 million disabled Europeans are able to enjoy full rights of citizenship within our European Union . #% I rise to propose , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , an amendment to our Rules of Procedure , which would see a fourth vice-chairman elected in each parliamentary committee , a bureau of four instead of three , and a College of Quaestors comprising six members instead of five . #% Russia must nevertheless take whatever action it can to put its own house in order . #% We have also got to make sure there are safeguards , because in encouraging third country nationals into the EU we must also make certain that we are not depriving those countries of the very important key workers that they need to help them develop . #% On services , the Commission has completely discarded its former promises about service negotiations being voluntary , and is now demanding a mandatory minimum opening of the market . #% Will you commit yourself specifically to addressing that problem ? #% Of course , this issue of bluefin tuna , which no doubt will dominate the debate , really highlights the issue , it focuses it , and it is , of course , a species purely in European waters . #% Secondly , Wim Duisenberg placed on record , as did Mrs H√§m√§l√§inen and Mr Issing , that in accordance with Article 105 of the Treaty , once the overriding principle of price stability has been secured and established then it is an obligation not just an option - wisely exercised using all instruments available to it - for the ECB to support the broad objectives of the European Union to promote growth and employment . #% In the meantime , we could surely restore the working party on human rights and democratisation within the Foreign Affairs Committee to maintain the oversight that this Parliament should now have on the EUR 100 million being spent annually under the Budget . #% Now we come to the issue of globalisation . #% Even the US National Academy of Sciences advising President Bush largely concurs with this finding . #% There seems to be some sort of abstract concept here of renewable energy . #% It will become increasingly difficult for us and for many Member States in the Council to act as if this is an issue that can be set to one side for many months and years . #% I want to draw his attention to another crucial machinery category , which is also partly affected by this directive , which is the whole issue about road-going machinery . #% Whatever happens , all these safeguards must be monitored carefully . #% Madam President , I am very sorry that Ms McKenna is not here today because I would have liked to have congratulated her personally on her very clear report on conservation and control measures for fishing in the Antarctic and the role played by the Commission for the conservation of Atlantic marine living resources . #% Now of course many have been released . #% That is the committee 's broad view . #% We have the REACH regulations in place , and their implementation is , as we heard at committee recently , evolving satisfactorily . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , may I first of all pay tribute to the work that Mrs Sornosa Mart√≠nez has done on this report , even though I do not agree with all of her conclusions . #% They are people who are similar but , nevertheless , qualitatively different . #% Madam President , I should like to request that the `` no smoking '' areas are respected , which was not the case at the last Strasbourg session . #% Secondly , Madam Vice-President/High Representative , will you broker a solution for the closure of Camp Ashraf in Iraq ? #% Cecil Rhodes , one of Britain 's most successful colonists , said the purpose of colonialism was : `` To find new lands in which we can easily obtain raw materials and at the same time exploit the cheap labour that is available from the natives of the colonies '' . #% Mr President , I can not help observing that we have ended up with two directives after all , just as we suggested at the beginning . #% If the rules do not provide for that , they should . #% President Bush can not , of course , admit this . #% My group will be abstaining on the final vote as we are simply not convinced that the Commission has properly made the case for harmonization in this area . #% Secondly , account must be taken of successive Community enlargements and the expansion of Community law , particularly in connection with the Community 's wider powers and the growing public and business awareness of Community law . #% But they will also tell us that what we do , we must do better . #% The number of self-employed workers in the United Kingdom has risen to 1.7 million . #% Mr President , I want to propose a technical oral amendment to Amendment No 28 . #% Perhaps if no communication has been forthcoming you could contact the British Government to ask for their official , legal position . #% Firstly , because we must tackle pollution . #% This can not be allowed to go on for another day . #% Does the President believe that the agreements which we have been discussing place too much of a burden on the United States as opposed to allowing us to adopt the burden or be subject to the burden of sharing responsibilities and resources in respect of counter-terrorism ? #% I hope the sun is shining upon him there and that he is being instructed to cover up well . #% In view of the proximity of the December date for the meeting in Geneva , I would like to ask , Commissioner , what kind of bridge-building and confidence-building you are engaged in at this time - having just had a moment to catch your breath after Canc√∫n - to try to ensure that we have some success there ? #% If anything should be corrected it is this . #% The Progress programme has now been running for three years and the overall impact has been positive . #% I am glad , therefore , to have the opportunity to ask some questions and to send our sympathies to those people involved . #% Meanwhile , criticism mounts from all sides : from pig breeders concerned about confusion at staging points ; from farmers faced by prohibitive definitions of a journey ; from animal welfare experts who see a lack of properly trained supervision and a shortage of inspectors as crucial shortcomings . #% We need to balance the need to operate an efficient single market with the need to protect Member State competence on taxation . #% Kosovo and stability in the Balkans must be a long-term project . #% Ordinary people can rest assured that the EU will continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid in order to prevent undue suffering and a total breakdown in civil society . #% This is an exercise in transparency , no more , no less . #% In contrast , my resolution also deals with the achievements of Romania in the economic field , where many structural reforms have been undertaken that we praise . #% We shall now have the shameful spectacle of European foreign ministers travelling to Africa for no other reason than to facilitate attendance at their meeting by the Zimbabweans . #% Banks and accountancy firms are running seminars and briefing clients . #% They want a directive and not a recommendation . #% I have been prudent and I have worked moderately hard . #% LIFE III , with its three components of nature , environment and third countries , has been a success in all respects , but particularly perhaps in the Natura 2000 sites of LIFE Nature . #% Could you explain why the EU continues to import birds when countries such as the United States , for example , consider that those same birds are not sustainably harvested ? #% The directive presses all the right buttons and goes some way towards addressing the problem . #% Moreover , the current crisis facing our farmers in Britain requires as a priority that this reform be postponed for the time being in order to prevent further deterioration of their economic circumstances and preserve stability of our rural communities . #% I would say this to them : although you are not elected , you will be treated as full members of the European political elite . #% It moves me very deeply every summer to see in the resorts of the Mediterranean and elsewhere large numbers of holidaymakers from eastern and central Europe including Russia holidaying in the way that we have done for many decades . #% I thank Mr Koukiadis for doing the decent thing and laying down his report . #% At the last meeting of the Conference of Presidents on 5 April this matter was referred to the Constitutional Affairs Committee and Madame Garaud was invited to represent us vis-√†-vis the Spanish authorities . #% Finally , to go back to the earlier part of the report , in Recital F , where a deliberate comparison is made with the United States , because there , less regulation allows for a much more entrepreneurial spirit . #% I hope reason prevails . #% 
In those circumstances , I believe it would be very foolish for those of us in the EU debating these matters to agree to even further emissions reductions . #% I see that Mrs McKenna felt so strongly about the matter herself that she did not bother to attend the vote . #% Mr President , I should just like to point out that the clock says it is 6.56 p.m. . #% I was concerned to read a comment in the Financial Times last week when you , Commissioner , were in London - where you made quite an impact - about you forcing the creation of workers ' consultation committees and stating that Anna Diamantopoulou ' s decision will dismay the UK Government and industry . #% . Mr President , it is more money again , is it not ? #% Both of these possess nuclear weapons and one of them at least has not disavowed first use of those weapons . #% I just hope between now and our first reading , and indeed between now and your second reading , we can have some serious discussions and serious conciliation and at the end of it some serious agreements to get a budget that we can all be satisfied with . #% Also , we have to make it clear that we will not tolerate war crimes and other criminal activities and that we have the clear intention of bringing criminals to book once there is an agreement . #% We want a pro-active approach to industrial restructuring and change . #% It was opposition to knee-jerk politics and to the writing of blank cheques for the future . #% Social policies , too , have to reflect the concerns of European citizens and need to be of higher concern than seems apparent from the recommendations currently known . #% For this reason , the British Conservative Delegation has abstained . #% This Parliament needs to know that those responsible for this failure have themselves been removed from their posts . #% It is quite clear that we need a uniform approach to this situation . #% These are already , of course , implemented by many other states . #% The contradiction was contained in what you said . #% This should be the only criterion for appointment and promotion within the European civil service . #% Finally , I would like to say that during the progress of the legislation through the European Parliament there have been three different ministers back in the UK , which may explain why the UK Government has made such a limp response to it . #% Mr President , as you may recall , last month I raised the issue of the extreme right-wing British National Party claiming that sympathetic serving police officers in Oldham have provided confidential police videos of the riots in that town , obviously calling into question evidence given by such biased officers in the ongoing trials . #% First , at our meeting on 11 November 2003 , the Commission noted that we would have to take up the matter of host entities ' grants again , with a view to taking a final decision in the light of the outcome of the budget trialogue of 13 November . #% A one-size-fits-all trade policy for the European Union can not work when you have countries and economies as different as the United Kingdom and Italy . #% President Prodi has drawn attention to the paradox that people want the Union to be doing more in several fields but they still distrust the system of government . #% This does not preclude the possibility , of course , that critical questions may be raised by Member States in the Council . #% Tonight , I want to simply repeat my closing statement to the Commission last week and say that redoubled efforts should be made to insist on the European Union 's neutrality in this process and that the European observation mission must be specifically tasked with monitoring the allegations of bias made in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . #% We should ensure that there is somebody in the Commission with responsibility for child matters . #% What we need to say is that Alstom will survive , and we must do everything possible to ensure that survival and protect those 110 000 jobs . #% It is always the case , and it is one of the problems as we reach the second reading , that one knows a good deal more about what the Commission will approve than what it will not . #% Many parts of this building are impressive and beautiful , although it is also , in my opinion , grandiose . #% We need health and safety legislation , yes ; but only when it is necessary at EU level and when it can not be done at Member State level . #% The EU has no legal right to set up its own space programme -- that depended on ratification of the failed Constitution . #% But I also ask the Commissioner to make progress on the visa issue , particularly for businesspeople , and on holding Turkey to its promises for the draft trade union law . #% Some think legitimacy impossible with a black-listed terrorist organisation competing in the polls , but Hamas has rebranded itself as a change and reform movement and has maintained a state of calm in the run-up to these elections in spite of Tuesday 's killing on the West Bank . #% If I was a tourist I would have no problem spending one week out of four here , it would be delightful . #% Our Labour Government has failed to address the problem of the postcode lottery , which means that the levels of care and availability of drugs can vary from street to street . #% We believe that it is right for Parliament to be consulted . #% If this House does nothing then it is party to every single blow that was rained upon that individual and other men like him and on gay women across the European Union . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , why does this report seek more international cooperation at university level ? #% She said the report came from a press statement in The Independent . #% I thank the BBC Watchdog Programme for providing me with details of the findings of a renowned British sports stadia expert , Dr Jim Dickey . #% Obviously he has not , as he is not listening to what we are saying . #% That question must be answered . #% Allegedly many were not homosexual but just enjoying the western culture of drinking alcohol and dancing . #% It would make far more sense to stop damaging third-country economies , rather than embarking on these extraordinary new ventures . #% The Commission suggested EUR 30 000 and the EPLP advocates a more cautious approach . #% I understand exactly the points that Mrs Fontaine made but , I ask you , on behalf of all Members of this House , to keep us better informed of the process . #% Also , by the time the Commission got around to producing the communication , it was being bombarded with notifications from Member States that they would begin to use the opt-out in their health-care sectors in response to the SIMAP and Jaeger rulings . #% Therefore will the Council agree to include discussion on a single seat for the Parliament in the forthcoming Plan D post-Constitution debate ? #% AIDS has to be a core theme of our development assistance . #% The resolution which has now been circulated to be voted upon tomorrow no longer contains that reference . #% The code of conduct does not allow us to comment on such outrageous statements , but I would like you , Mr President , to disavow those statements on behalf of this House . #% Mr President , I rise on the comment made by my colleague , Mr Evans , yesterday regarding the quantity of documentation we receive . #% Mr President , today we must assess what this report is about , which is the safe transportation of radioactive materials . #% Perhaps we should not be surprised at what has happened . #% Indeed the famous six-pack was heavily over-implemented in the United Kingdom imposing burdens which are not imposed in other countries . #% This will give greater transparency to the EMI 's work and that , in turn , will benefit us all . #% This report is intended to provide the financial foundations of the EU superstate which I and my constituents ( ... ) reject . #% We bitterly regret , therefore , that after the recent presidential election and the parliamentary elections in Egypt in November and December last year , Dr Nour was arrested . #% Common standards , not draconian regulation , are required for the continued safety for all Europe 's citizens . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his most helpful answer . #% All we are really discussing are the minutiae of interinstitutional agreements -- or perhaps at this stage one should say ` disagreements ' -- but are we addressing the real issues of the European Union budget ? #% So having focussed on two priority areas , I should explain the process used to identify those areas . #% Again in my country - I am sorry to refer specifically to British experience - I regret to say that all too often Brussels , the European Commission , the European Community , being used as a scapegoat or , indeed , as a fig-leaf . #% We must pace the reaction , try to be consistent and , above all , be fair , especially on Cyprus and Armenia . #% Mr President , I would like to follow on from the point that Mr Cox has made . #% Having said that , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the spirit in which he has approached this complicated subject and the way in which he has embraced amendments from all sides , certainly including some of my own . #% Let me tell you these are not fly-by-night dreams of someone in Parliament . #% 
We now have to show that we are serious in our threats to take action . #% We are not saying that the specialist committees should not be involved in this , nor that there should not be a dialogue . #% Mrs Palacio referred in her introduction to Internet years and the speed of approach . #% Our overriding objective was to get this very important report through as the first report communitarising European Community immigration laws and as a matter of justice to third-country nationals . #% The report also contains errors of fact . #% More generally , there seems to be considerable overlap between reports on employment matters produced on these agencies by the Commission and by the Policy Department of the European Parliament . #% Finally , I would like to wish you all a happy Christmas . #% Nevertheless , the work of Mr Cabrol in bringing some complex negotiations to a conclusion deserves a wider audience and our congratulations , as well as the vote of approval which it will undoubtedly achieve tomorrow , with the full support of my group . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , the Ivory Coast is an unstable country that has been made more unstable by environmental crime which has flowed from our continent down to Africa ; with a Dutch ship and Dutch port authorities , a Greek-owned ship flying the Panamanian flag , then Ivorian companies and trucks dumping petrochemicals , killing - according to the United Nations - 12 people , and resulting in 104 000 people - again according to the United Nations - having medical care needs . #% By leaving people in the dark without water ? #% You do not need much imagination to see how this provision could undermine press freedom . #% I and my British Conservative colleagues abhor any actions by individuals , governments or political parties to incite racism , anti-Semitism and homophobia . #% One of the reasons for this is that if we do not put in significant amounts the European Union may not have a seat at the table - a seat on the board . #% As the Commissioner said , this is an issue which touches every worker and family within the European Union . #% I rise to speak about the women of Afghanistan . #% We should not forget that prime responsibility for education rests with students and scholars themselves . #% The Commission says it wants to retain its board seat . #% The Informal Council was a wasted opportunity . #% I do not believe it is helpful for any country to institutionalise minorities . #% That is not how to create competitiveness . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Schwaiger , on his outstanding efforts in forging a broad cross-party approach to this hugely important issue , which will have consequences for us all for many years to come . #% I do not blame the Commissioner who inherited this from her predecessor , but the recommendation from the Commission was deeply flawed and thoroughly unpopular with Member States , who supported it only because it was non-binding and could therefore be ignored . #% Would you please try and improve the register which is , as I said , a very small mouse . #% The second irony concerns political and economic participation - engaging at all EU levels of added value . #% It is very unusual for a vote to be called in this way with about 12 Members in the House . #% While the Indonesian army is still engaged in acts of repression , the embargo must stay . #% I also call on the UK Government to raise the issue with other Member States , as it is the Council 's responsibility . #% Finally , your White Paper quite rightly notes that action is going to have to be taken when managers are not performing to the expected standard . #% The rapporteur stresses elimination of discrimination , on which I fully support him , but I would also add that respect for cultural traditions must not be at the expense of fundamental human rights . #% It is the first time in seven years in this House that I have found the Council more progressive than the European Parliament . #% Clear labelling will enable consumers to choose and enjoy the chocolate that they want . #% That would be unacceptable to Parliament and I therefore ask for the report to be referred back to committee . #% We need to be absolutely clear that we reject and are prepared to speak out about the attitude of the Sudanese Government to anyone who wishes to fight against oppression and for rights and freedoms . #% These are serious problems for an information technology department which is already in many ways over-stretched and are probably two of the most important demands that will made of it . #% He was in Brussels recently to receive the acclaim of this House on its important anniversary . #% We had another event on 21 July , which fortunately was unsuccessful . #% There is absolutely no case on social grounds , such as could possibly be made for Greece or Spain , for public money to be used in this way . #% When in a hole , one should stop digging , and I therefore ask him to give us full disclosure . #% The adoption of this decision will be a major step forward in the fight against diseases . #% We also put forward an amendment covering the issue of jurisdiction on bids originating from companies in countries outside the European Union -- third countries -- and the need for those to be subject to national authorisation within . #% The ACP was , for example , raising the issues of the British Government , its attitude to Guantanamo Bay and its proposals for the detention of suspects , or indeed people with mental health problems . #% On this and this alone I believe that we have reason to go beyond the common position for safety 's sake . #% During the course of 1997 it is absolutely essential that the Council , the Commission and this Parliament seek to establish a mechanism as a counterweight to the centralized monetary authority of the European Central Bank so that we have some sort of economic governance within the European Union . #% Today I stand here to ask further details following the October Council conclusions , in which the Commission was asked to work towards a limited treaty change required to establish a permanent crisis resolution mechanism . #% Whether a report deals with tax structures -- which is the case here -- or tax levels , it is not a competence of the European Union and these discussions should not , in my opinion , be taking place here . #% It must be simple both in terms of clarity and in terms of its administration . #% We have to expect that it will take time to implement this report . #% That is why I hope -- and I am glad Commissioner Nielson is here -- that we see no slackening of our commitments to development policy , no slackening of our commitments to meet the millennium development goals and that we redouble our efforts to develop better relationships with our neighbours . #% Let us have a Commission proposal and statutory right to interest right across the European Union to encourage and help small businesses . #% According to the peer-reviewed article about to appear in the scientific journal , which was mentioned by Mr Maaten , these values will bring no improvement for the quality of fresh water at all . #% The Commission must accept the need for people carrying out activities in this area to accept legal responsibility for the consequences of any accidents . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner , first , what measures are going to be recommended which will increase ownership by local people on the ground in the Stability Pact . #% I have said this at a trialogue meeting , we have said it in our committee and I now wish it to go on public record . #% If Mr Pƒôk and Mr Mote are against it , Mrs G√°l must have taken the right route and I recommend this report to the House . #% Therefore , it seems logical that Parliament should support the two amendments which I have retabled from first reading . #% We do not have that second part of the proposal before us at the moment , but we will happily give consideration to such a proposal and investigate its feasibility . #% We ought to help these developing countries . #% It is clear , of course , that in many ways the really hard work starts now , with the implementation of our proposals . #% Have we got a Stability and Growth Pact or not ? #% I apologise to Mrs Cederschi√∂ld for mistiming my arrival and arriving after much of the debate . #% In spite of Amnesty International 's urgent appeal to exert pressure on the Mugabe regime , the African Union last week still refused to condemn President Mugabe . #% Finally , I want to pick up the question about tax evasion , which the Prime Minister mentioned , and hope that future presidencies - I do not hold out much hope for the next one - will look at this question of tax evasion within the European Union and beyond it , because at the moment we are losing fortunes from our public budgets due to the non-payment of taxes by corporations . #% This offers a way forward for the future . #% While Palestinians see themselves in a struggle for national liberation from oppressive Israeli occupation , 75 percent of Israelis see themselves as the principal victims , struggling for national survival . #% With the Treaty of Nice , signed by every Member State , ratified by every national parliament , we permitted decisions by qualified-majority voting . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome the future President-in-Office by quoting Charles Dickens : ` it was the best of times , it was the worst of times , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us ' . #% 
I welcome your frankness , Mr Duisenberg , in making clear the very big political leap which has been made by those countries which have already entered Euroland . #% In my concluding remarks I would like to comment on one or two points . #% Procrastination is not a credible policy . #% It is clearly outrageous that the state should condemn the victims , rather than their aggressors . #% If there is to be any discussion of committees of inquiry , it must be in that area , looking at the system by which the Commission examines allegations of inadequacy , of impropriety , of irregularity against itself and its staff . #% I do not believe these proposals match that requirement and therefore it is important , as Commissioner Kinnock has indicated , that elections for a new Legislative Council are held as soon as possible . #% Turkmenistan has become a land of torture and imprisonment , of death in custody , of intolerance towards political and religious views . #% In conciliation could I ask you to make allowance for these farmers who have invested in cleaning up the environment by installing incinerators , and for whom the cost would be excessive should they not be able to continue . #% The challenge for everybody in the year 2002 is therefore to present the report in the November plenary rather than in the December plenary . #% Whether while abroad on holiday , for business purposes or perhaps as a student , the victim of a burglary , a violent personal crime , or a terrorist attack takes that crime very personally and expects something to be done about it . #% This work should be given a much higher profile and recognition , especially in the Commission 's annual report . #% Nothing could be more important for an EU of 25 countries than to have a common European policy on immigration and , alongside but separate , a common European policy for asylum . #% We hope to halve the number of deaths by 2010 . #% Furthermore , if debts are not repaid , creditors will also be able to recoup their costs for collecting bad debts . #% So I would like to warmly thank him for that and , of course , we look forward to it . #% Nevertheless , I hope the Commission will take note of the sentiment and clean up its act . #% Latvia and Lithuania have made enormous progress economically but , as Commissioner van den Broek has indicated , we must see if they can sustain that . #% That is specifically ruled out . #% Mr President , yesterday marked the death of the 100th British serviceman killed in Iraq . #% This is an important subject , which brings practical benefits to small - and medium-sized companies . #% And that is the importance of the co-decision procedure - to have a parliamentary body directly elected at European level to interact with the Council . #% Too often we are left with the impression of a Commission that is a spectator rather than a powerful actor . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her very practical report . #% We congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their work to achieve that . #% It is very clear that Parliament is united in saying that there should be no derogations that would compromise the integrity and the effectiveness of a ban . #% Speakers representing organisations from groups which often experience social exclusion - poor people , those with disabilities , those from minority ethnic groups etc. were asked whether they would rather see the implementation of a few policies that have worked elsewhere or have a full programme of real consultation , even if they did not then get what they wanted . #% This regulation is drafted as a temporary measure before the Treaty of Nice comes into force and I find it absolutely shameful that the nationalists in this Parliament are seeking to suppress the growth of proper , credible and legitimate transnational political parties . #% If those are the lessons that are learnt from the Wemheuer and the De Luca reports , then these two reports will have done Parliament and European taxpayers a great service . #% At the moment the CFSP is a mixture of national attitudes and European attitudes and the particular subject we are debating today of course only involves one single Member State of the European Union . #% It would be a tragedy in a very real sense because the WHO points out that there are 80 primary immune deficiency conditions in our world and it is estimated that some 50 000 to 90 000 people in our Europe suffer from those conditions . #% Commissioner , I represent the West Midlands . #% You indicated that this might be ready by August , which misses this year 's summer holiday period . #% In Britain people have got used to copying their favourite TV programme and watching it at leisure at the time most convenient for them . #% I hope the Commissioner will confirm that tonight . #% We do not want to see an all-singing , all-dancing bureaucracy - we want an authority which is focused on safety , on the assessment of risk , on giving guidance where appropriate to the managers of risk . #% Can I also thank the Commissioner for what was a very good and full response to that question which went a long way towards meeting the reasons for which it was tabled . #% That should be given full support from all groups . #% Equally , we have to be clear that any country that makes the right sort of progress should be entitled to join in the enlargement negotiations as soon as possible . #% It will allow us to pretend that we are doing something to prevent animal cruelty , but while maintaining the same testing requirements not one fewer animal would suffer . #% I welcome Commissioner Liikanen 's statement and his communication , which is a major step forward . #% As you would expect , Mr President , as a Conservative I do not often agree with my Prime Minister , Mr Blair . #% If Commissioner Fischler does not know the answer now , I suggest , if the House agrees with Mr Cunha , that when the assessment is finalised we make sure that the correct wording goes in the final text for the Official Journal . #% When that is achieved , we can all look forward to Hungary joining the Union and having a good audiovisual sector as well . #% It is about time that the European Union stopped intervening and spending taxpayers ' money on one side of this type of political debate . #% Just how will the first ever human rights call for an ASEAN country be interpreted in the case of Vietnam . #% It would seem to me to indicate an unhappy situation in the representative 's office because he should have done two years ago what you are now arranging to do . #% Pakistan 's constitution , although nominally upholding religious freedom , still allows for laws such as the blasphemy laws , which are discriminatory towards non-Muslims , and the persecution of Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities is a common feature . #% I note in Commissioner Patten 's report on the assessment by Carla Del Ponte that Croatia is complying in full with ICTY and doing all it can to find General Gotovina . #% I am sorry for those of my colleagues who are distinguished lawyers , I do not wish them any diminution in their profits , but this is not something we should encourage . #% The Union has rigid quotas , tariffs and other protectionist policies restricting trade with third countries . #% It has failed completely . #% In the not too distant future , when Britain is emerged from the slough of despond of the Thatcher and Major years , the United Kingdom too will join the long march of Everyman to the city on the hill . #% It is welcome news indeed that the UK Presidency is committed to getting an agreement before the end of December on the energy efficiency and energy services directive , but will the Minister assure us today that this will be a directive with big teeth ; one which makes serious , binding commitments on energy reduction ; one which sets a framework for energy efficiency and stimulates a rapid growth in energy efficiency services across Europe ? #% Too rigid an application of the principle of individual responsibility will cause major problems for small - and medium-sized enterprises across Europe and prevent sensible collective schemes being implemented . #% I also support limits on exports to protect stocks , which I am sure the WTO will support , and financial help from the EU to ensure rivers remain open for the passage of elvers . #% The first concerns paragraph 2 of Article 27 in the classical directive and the equivalent text in the utilities directive . #% The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done . #% Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation . #% British citizens , who already contribute disproportionately to the EU budget , pay twice for the CAP : once through their taxes , and again in the supermarket . #% But I do not think we should be seeking to remove countries ' names from resolutions . #% That is one group that seems to have gone backwards . #% May I put a question about the Cornish language to the President-in-Office of the Council ? #% They are a good example of targeted , effective , cooperative effort across the EU , without excessive bureaucracy , and we must be prepared to develop this level of cooperation , particularly now that we have the advantages of technology . #% Frankly , this Constitution must be unacceptable to any democrat , because the terms of Article 59 , the terms of withdrawal , are totally unacceptable . #% That has now grown to 163 countries and indeed production is now banned in the European Union , in OECD countries and will be in developing countries from the year 2010 . #% It is an important principle - maybe this is an uncontroversial issue but the principle of the quality and clarity of legislative instruments is important . #% 
This proposal and its associated measures will tackle a source of emissions previously beyond EU regulation . #% But I would also like to know whether you are ensuring that the delivery of project will also benefit the Tibetan people , not just its design , I would also like to ask the Commissioner to ensure that this is a much more open and transparent process than the last incarnation of this project and that the relevant documents will be available to Parliament and other interested parties . #% And that is where education and the promotion of awareness-raising and ending the discrimination that blights the lives of people living with AIDS and HIV is so important . #% Croatia has renewed its commitment to respect its minority population and cultures and the adoption of national legislation supporting the use of minority languages was one of the first achievements of the new Croatian Government last year . #% In the Netherlands the animals were also slaughtered and there is quite a problem here in the suggestion that vaccination actually saves the animal 's life . #% Would the Commissioner make available to this Parliament the studies that back up these assertions ? #% The proposals to reduce sulphur content to 0.1 % by weight in a variety of fuels are technically realizable and within reasonable cost limits . #% Who authorised the security staff to interfere with free and peaceful expressions of political opinion outside this House , and on what authority was this done , having regard to the Rules of Procedure or any other relevant authority ? #% Yes , this is , of course , the same Commission that is forcing UK sheep farmers to unnecessarily identify sheep individually with unreliable electronic equipment . #% All of it should be poverty-focused . #% Mr President , there is much to be welcomed in the Commissioner 's statement , in particular its acknowledgement of the role of the grey market in bringing prices down , the use of the Internet , car supermarkets in the proper trade in spare parts and servicing . #% Without the WTO the law of the jungle and the power of might over right would prevail - hardly an outcome the critics of the WTO would welcome . #% We have given the go-ahead for large multinational companies to plunder and play fast and loose with the world 's genetic resources . #% It is only right that hauliers should be allowed some time to sleep , particularly before going on long journeys . #% Lastly I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this issue was addressed in the Conference of Presidents a few months ago when , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , it was suggested that an ad hoc delegation should go to Afghanistan . #% Not so long ago Miss Morelli , in charge of training in the Council , in the presence of Commission representatives , reaffirmed on several occasions that the jobs of the teachers were guaranteed until they retired . #% The scope is a vexed issue because we have other existing instruments under discussion which , at times , come into tension . #% I should be grateful if you could say whether the Socialist Group of MEPs , including the Labour MEPs , might support us now on the retention of the individual opt-out ? #% Until we resolve these issues there will be no long-term solution for Iraq . #% Saddam must destroy all remaining stocks of chemical and biological weapons and the potential to develop other weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear weapons . #% We on the Transport Committee often highlight the need for effective interoperability in the rail sector . #% In English ` moving away ' does not mean ` abandon ' but a gradual approach . #% The complainant 's lawyer in Sweden has reportedly stated that the ladies themselves can not tell if the acts in question constituted rapes , because they are not lawyers . #% All three big parties are authoritarian . #% Undoubtedly , the Kremlin treasures this international legitimisation of a government described in the US diplomatic cables recently leaked by WikiLeaks as a virtual Mafia state . #% Yes , there should be financial assistance to those farming on the most difficult terrain and to help older farmers to retire . #% This figure is considerably lower than that proposed by both the Commission and Council . #% Secondly , it has been made clear that a change of government in one Member State does not provide a legal basis for terminating agreements concluded at intergovernmental level . '' #% Europe has a proud maritime past , I believe this strategy , as outlined by Commissioner Kinnock , will lay the foundations for a great maritime future . #% On this basis , I will abstain on this report . #% He who pays the piper calls the tune . #% The EU-Mexico agreement is therefore urgently needed to help restore the balance and to foster political and cultural , as well as economic , links between Mexico and Europe in the interests of both sides . #% We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then , most important of all , working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities . #% Secondly , the issue of importing into the European Union and the highly questionable and grim circumstances surrounding it has already been raised . #% We have to intensify the peer review and monitoring function for human rights within the European Union if we are to increase mutual trust and , therefore , provide a basis for mutual recognition of judicial decisions . #% I suppose a recommendation is really rather the equivalent of us all moving down into the centre of Strasbourg and attending the cathedral in order to make an act of collective prayer . #% Do you not foresee an opportunity here to bring ECHO under your policy-making umbrella so that we have a more cohesive approach to emergencies when they arise ; so that we do not have this problem of different instruments ; so that we are addressing the problem with one mind and can then deliver with urgency and efficiency ? #% There is an obvious need for a common approach and to edge very cautiously towards agreement , for example in the field of immigration and its close links to employment and social inclusion . #% But if the Commission and Council disagree with this approach , let them tell us where the money will come from . #% The Belgian police refused to take that further evidence . #% Disputation which causes delay is obviously not acceptable in view of the need to find a rapid solution to the problem and the Commission is therefore open to a compromise which maintains those objectives of speed and effectiveness . #% Now I come to the two big issues for this Parliament . #% Nowhere do we complain that China holds too few euros -- rather than dollars -- or say that China should continue to work with the European Union on the six-party talks . #% Those companies which have a small number of employees find it most difficult to access resources to expand their businesses . #% We particularly endorse the references to biodiversity and to the need for action in relation both to ghost fishing and discards , as well as the call for the Commission to continue to promote the adoption of an FAO International Plan of Action on bycatch reduction . #% Stockholm will build on what was set out at last year 's Lisbon Summit which outlined plans for a dynamic , knowledge-based and competitive economy . #% If he thinks it is such a success , I would argue that he speak to the millions of unemployed people , youngsters mainly in the Iberian Peninsula , southern Italy and the rest of Europe , who are suffering from this disgraceful , fraudulent and deceitful currency which was rammed down the throats of the people of Europe against their will . #% But the incredible thing was that many of the new bosses had also worked for that same evil system before . #% It is no good saying that anyone can opt out of those measures . #% To Ukraine , to India , to Argentina , to Brazil , where all the eggs will have been laid in battery cages . #% We have seen a rise not only in hate-speak but also in racist , xenophobic and homophobic violence , and the Council has done nothing when it comes to Articles 6 and 7 . #% This morning I want to concentrate on just one issue : structural funding . #% I might even argue that under Article 119 ( 1 ) a request for a roll-call vote only applies to the amendment as printed and put before us and can not apply to an oral amendment . #% That has not yet been forthcoming , but we live in hope . #% On that point , I stand here in a same-sex relationship of 20 years , yet my partner of 20 years would not be given the definition of family if he were to move with me to Brussels so I can do my work in the Parliament . #% I was one of 400 000 countryside marchers in London on Sunday who would not agree . #% They can be used by criminals as well as to the advantage of a great number of people who want to pursue their business and private interests . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , there is a credible sounding justification for each one of the four financing instruments being presented to Parliament today . #% Fourthly , we want much quicker action by the Commission to take Member States to court when they break EU law . #% I should like to mention by way of a rider that I feel that the House has been treated somewhat with contempt today because this Baltic debate has been put back by four hours . #% He has misled the British people and they see it live on their television screens . #% My second concern is that the first and last mention of Parliament is in May , in relation to the employment guidelines . #% Mr President , I have some sympathy with Mr Sacr√©deus . #% Hamas remains a terrorist organisation with links to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hezbollah . #% Discrimination against women is also very acute in Iran and we must fully maintain our criticism and take a stand against this . #% I share the view of my JSB colleagues that this is acceptable . ' - i.e. that we trust the guys . #% 
The President-in-Office and President Prodi have described the workings of the Convention - this is not the Convention I have been attending . #% Madam President , I thank the President-in-Office for his statement . #% I hope I never have to go through that again because it was a waste of time if nothing else . #% The House should hear and debate that argument and actually take a decision on it . #% I would like to express a personal view . #% We , in our own and their interests , must have the capacity to engage without the Americans . #% In response to the first question , from a parliamentary point of view , I think we have to say that it is not ideal . #% Deterrence does not necessarily work . #% Future generations will not forgive us if we allow irreplaceable habitats to be destroyed , whose preservation we actually voted for eight years ago when we adopted our report on the habitats directive and then again in 1997 with the changes to the annex of the directive . #% Mr Barroso talked about a cut-price Europe and the implications of that destination if we get to it . #% It suffers from terrible ecological problems in the Caspian Sea as a result of DDT and toxic defoliants used in cotton farming . #% Now it seems that after the Court has ruled there is an appeal , so it will still be sub judice . #% That is something that is of wider general application than simply to the matter of the Rules of Procedure . #% I am pleased , Commissioner , that you mentioned enforcement . #% One of the purposes of the new proposal was to close up these previous loopholes which allowed privatised utilities to escape the obligation . #% I hope the Commission will at all times be genuinely and consistently guided by that principle and by this report . #% I thought we were all in agreement that wage rises justified by productivity gains should be deemed normal and acceptable . #% On the whole , the committee received rather conflicting signals about the recommended maximum 1 % content level . #% While the Commission cautions that sweeping changes can not realistically be expected , we look forward to further incremental steps that start to meet our concerns . #% I think that Amendment No 38 is not well drafted . #% Parliament is beginning to feel a sense of urgency about the need to give greater coherence to the work of the social partners . #% Like my colleagues in the UK Conservative Delegation , I have consistently supported the principle and the practice of employee information and consultation . #% This demonstrates yet again Labour 's commitment to create an environment for entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish across Europe . #% Parliament should not be asking for it , and the Council should not give it . #% Fine words from our government are all very well , but what we now need is action . #% Then there is this brave attempt to remove trade barriers between these two major trading blocs . #% I should like to quote directly from what two of the teachers said on that occasion : #% We also have questions surrounding Article 3 ( c ) about where people should be returned to , and feel that , if the reference to ` other arrangements ' includes the metaphorical handshakes that we have seen in the past between Mr Berlusconi and Gadafi , this is unacceptable as such accords are made outside of written public agreements . #% The PPE-DE Group has therefore put forward a number of amendments to remove these and other muddled messages . #% The fact is , this is already a bureaucratic , over-regulated model and there will not be any real economic growth until we deregulate and free up our businesses . #% Mr President , I agree with everyone who has spoken tonight . #% This is not about high-and-mighty insurance companies hindering claims , it is about the European Parliament driving forward a lifeline for our citizens . #% We have not tried to play party politics or national politics and petty games of that sort on this side of the House . #% It will divide the English nation and undermine our nationality . #% I would like it to clarify exactly what the scope of its proposal is . #% Central to the real fight to create the proper and stable legal and administrative environment in which SMEs can thrive , grow and breed jobs is to institute a business impact assessment on EU legislation , to weed out the bramble of bad ideas , whilst protecting high environmental and social standards . #% I would particularly like to commend to the House the rapporteur 's emphasis on the N +2 principle and the management committee of representatives of Member States . #% The assassination of Maksharip Aushev highlights the brutality that unfortunately meets protest . #% I am disappointed to see that our Socialist colleagues are proposing that clause should be taken out of this resolution . #% We also know that a drone has been discovered which is capable of spreading biological and chemical weapons , and we know the cluster bombs have also been discovered . #% Iran needs to understand that Europe is extending the hand of friendship and that ways can be found to live together without Iran losing either its identity or its opposition to the worst of Western values . #% The Tindemans report also makes the mistake of assuming that the WEU and the EU are integrated , while the Treaty only mentions the possibility . #% We completely condemn these articles . #% If the plan is to mirror the position of the EMU in relationship to the EU , then I foresee that the ESDP is going to inhibit NATO from functioning efficiently and properly . #% We must look at the facts and situation that presents itself to us . #% 12,000 new , notified addict cases come each year ; we have 70,000 drug offenders a year and we lose 1,200 people through drug-related deaths per year . #% We should not be giving those applicant countries false hope until we know the cost . #% Clearly there are a whole range of issues of a political and security nature on this agenda to which you have referred , particularly the political challenges dealing with democracy , human rights and the rule of law . #% To come down to 1 ppm is a significant achievement . #% Please bear in mind that we have stood side by side with the Commission . #% In that respect I would have perhaps expected to see more of a theme emerging with regard to the need for what I would call financial security for our citizens in a world where we know there is financial turbulence at the moment and where people feel uncertain about the future - perhaps more of a theme in that respect . #% One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago . #% This directive would be a welcome step in ensuring that the respective foreign insurers get in contact quickly and the proposals for settlement are promptly forthcoming . #% According to Amnesty International , the number of executions at least doubled in 1996 and arrests of all who step out of line , now of oil workers on strike , and the persecution of religious minorities have continued . #% Tomorrow I understand there will be a new children 's law . #% It is therefore very important now that we are negotiating a multilateral trade framework which respects that very critical relationship with the developing world that we continue to say that we will honour our obligations to the ACP . #% All of the scientists , the researchers , there were female . #% We also need a serious political dialogue with China . #% Mr President , the Delors 1992 programme for the single market was an inspiration for all Europe to embark upon Europe 's big idea to get its people back to work . #% I would agree with the Council 's analysis of the first meeting of the Environment Council during this presidency . #% As the rapporteur for Bulgaria over the past six years , I have seen at first hand the progress that has been made in transforming the economy , the political system and the administrative structures of that country . #% However , despite what I said in that speech , my comments were deliberately misrepresented by subsequent speakers from the UK Labour party , presumably for the same domestic party political reasons which dictate so much of their comments to the House . #% I consider that would be a real health and safety issue requiring rapid action . #% I welcome the papers that were presented at Hampton Court , because they deal with how the European Union can bring added value to our citizens , particularly in the area of the energy markets where we have a crisis waiting to happen . #% When our citizens or our businesses have to resort to the courts , they need to get past that first step , which is the service of documents , possibly in another jurisdiction , before initiating proceedings . #% As the Commissioner made clear , this is a highly sensitive issue and it involves many aspects of public interest . #% 
I have three times attempted to gain the support of this Parliament in condemning this law . #% Can I push you a bit further on that last point you made , because up until then I was a little disappointed with what you were saying in implying that the legislation was already there . #% Mr President , over two years since the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa , when his son , Ken , came to Brussels three days later and generated total and absolute support from every part of this House for a return to democracy and human rights in Nigeria , we are forced once again to ask the European Parliament to condemn the Abacha regime 's continuing disregard for these principles . #% It is not an easy job , there is never enough money , but it is one I would rather do than be the general budget rapporteur . #% The fact that we work to financial perspectives within different categories or with different categories means that if we use the ABB system we will not know what the ceilings are within the different categories . #% That has long been the case , but the actual procedures by which we have done it have not always been working satisfactorily , and I welcome this updating and rationalisation that has been put forward . #% For that reason , a timetable needs to be set in each Member State , and the Commission , in consultation with Parliament , should do that . #% Not content with that , the Government has recently raised the target to 60-70 % by 2050 . #% It is essential as a means of convincing the citizens of the European Union that this has been a worthwhile project , the project of consolidation in terms of our economies , that we can demonstrate that the EMU project is not just a monetary union but an economic union and a social union that will bring about reductions in long-term , structural and cyclical unemployment throughout the European Union . #% I saw the value of my cattle drop to virtually nothing . #% Furthermore , support for Islamic fundamentalist groups involved in terrorism in other countries like Algeria is reported to have been maintained and some 30 opponents of the regime have been killed abroad . #% If shocking pictures of smoke-filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking , go ahead and print them on packs . #% Energy has shot up the political agenda , but geo-political initiatives are only one part of tackling the security of supply problem . #% I hope the Commission will build upon this goodwill and not dissipate it . #% I would like , under Article 13 , to see a specific directive on age and on disability . #% But how can this be done ? #% How will it be protected by them and , importantly , how can we be assured that it remains so ? #% However , there are still millions of tonnes of asbestos in Europe 's buildings throughout the European Union . #% The record will show that I said that the Vice-President of the Commission , Manuel Mar√≠n , suspended the contracts and that I went on to say that if he acted too precipitately , the contractors and others would have an opportunity to assert their rights in the civil courts . #% He also proposes allowing national measures to protect those products until a Community decision has been made . #% You will have my assistance in ensuring that this passes through Parliament as quickly as possible . #% He displayed great personal commitment to ensure that the European Union spoke with one voice and a determination - even if sometimes a grim determination - to reach agreement . #% Let me also just mention pensions and the need for us to have a good quality directive on pensions - one that avoids the prudential plus approach . #% That is particularly arduous , of course , in the case of Sweden and will continue to be the case until the completion of the √òresund link . #% Thirdly , I want to mention an area on which my colleague , Mr Wyn , and I tabled an amendment which was rejected by the committee - which is unusual because our committee normally shows very good sense . #% I would point out that at first reading , Green amendments were aimed specifically at enabling national re-use schemes to proceed , but on that occasion we unfortunately did not secure a big enough majority to get that through . #% The situation in Sri Lanka at the moment is tragic , and there have indeed been many breaches of human rights . #% Indeed , I would like to see some mechanism whereby we can have a regular reporting mechanism to ensure that safety standards throughout the EU are not only maintained but are implemented and enforced at a high level . #% This made it clear , in the remarks column , that one organisation , any single organisation within that spending line should not get more than 65 % . #% Mr President , a few weeks ago we saw the publication of the long-awaited US Roadmap to peace in the Middle East , a document fully supported by the rest of the international community , including the Quartet of the US , the EU , Russia and the UN . #% A unified system through Eurocontrol already exists . #% Whilst we have been unable to reach an agreement with the Council on the issue of financing these security measures , the Commission has agreed to come forward with a separate proposal on financing these measures within the next few months . #% I think that if you have a guarantee fund effectively put together it should be a partnership between the private and the public sector , it should be on the basis of loans , not gifts , and it should be on the basis of a process whereby it can be audited and accounted for over a five-year period . #% Therefore , I believe we should do more to support democratically elected governments and help them to reinforce the mechanisms in their countries for distributing the aid and making sure that the money donated is widely used . #% But I would just like to stress the paragraph of Mr Eurling 's report that invites the Turkish Government to take more active steps to bring about reconciliation with those Kurdish forces who have chosen to abandon the use of arms . #% How much have we spent solving the health problems in Belarus ? #% As a UKIP MEP , I must agree that seizure and deportation of people from one country to be tried in another , without judicial oversight , and to face foreign imprisonment , is an alien process . #% It is EUR 1 per European citizen per year of the programme . #% Hopefully , by the time we come around to another cycle of these procedures , Mr Miller and I will not be here late on a Tuesday evening , talking about the technical details of heaters , tyres or whatever it is , but we will have had a chance to make an overall political input into the scope of motor vehicle regulation . #% What can not be ignored are the challenges of globalisation now facing our Union , the explosion of the audiovisual and information society , the need for an educational capacity of great depth and breadth and , finally , the need to establish the legitimacy of our institutions and reinvigorate their forms . #% It will affect the very way young people and others speak , think and act . #% For example , the installation of microchips which suggest that cartridges are empty and even in some cases stop printers working , when in fact they have plenty of ink left . #% I hope that we make progress and I look forward , like everybody else in this Parliament , to the day when set-aside will be a thing of the past . #% This is an issue of great importance both for producers and for consumers . #% We have advocated a very child-centred approach to early years education and care , with the best interests of the child at the heart of this . #% We are talking about water and sanitation programmes which do so much to improve the quality of life of people in the townships and rural areas . #% In my opinion Parliament would need to refer this to the European Court of Justice for resolution under Article 232 of the Treaty . #% Therefore , I urge colleagues to vote for this report , which will send a very clear signal to the Commission and to the Council that Parliament is looking for ambitious but realistic proposals in this field . #% There has been a substantial variation in the velocity of circulation because of new developments within the financial services industry and this is merely another one of those . #% Therefore in conclusion could I also ask the President-in-Office to say something about the campaign that needs to be organized during the course of this year to make sure that the citizens understand the process of the EMU and realise that it is for the benefit of their lives and the future that this project is completed properly . #% Membership of the European Union involves serious surrender of sovereignty and an unwelcome intrusion of its laws into everyday life . #% I see no reason why , on the clear evidence that the Commission has heard , GSP should not now be withdrawn as quickly as possible . #% The new posts needed to enable the Commission to fulfil its policy and operational obligations to 2006 , set out in fine detail in the amending letter and accompanying documents , will cost around EUR 542 million . #% There is also the question of practicality . #% We must avoid hostilities and stop war breaking out again at all costs . #% If anything was more calculated to make Europe unloved it is its determination to control every nook and cranny of our lives . #% Mr President , what we learned from the Dutch and French referenda was that many people , sadly , see the EU as part of the threat of globalisation , rather than offering a safe haven from its colder winds . #% They see a beautiful planet , teeming with life , but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up . #% You are only here because the Lisbon Treaty went through without the British people being given the referendum that they were promised . #% The text has now been distributed and while the English and Spanish versions include that reference to Michelin it appears to have been removed from the other language versions . #% The argument of road safety used by many does not wash from my point of view . #% However , I , along with colleagues who have investigated this matter , believe that it needs proper consideration . #% In my city , one-third of the population is from ethnic minorities . #% We would welcome a clearer delineation of competences , as the Berlin Declaration by the European Democrat Union last month favoured , provided that it is not an excuse to strengthen the centre . #% Has the Council considered calling on the Commission to take infringement action against the UK Government , and if not , why not ? #% It is good that the Commission has addressed the socio-economic problems but the measures so far seem like prescribing a couple of aspirins to cure a severe case of pneumonia . #% 
However , the call for research to promote regulation is premature . #% This would end the damaging rotation whereby first one country then another sees its numbers peak . #% I am very unhappy about that . #% A single scheme has advantages for business : for example , only one registration fee and inspection , standardised packaging , and advantages for consumers who will not be confused by a plethora of labels . #% Mr President , if we are going to try and get this vote through quickly , I suggest that the PPE , if they are going to continue to vote against their own amendments , actually have the courage to withdraw them before we go right the way through this session . #% I am proud to inform the House that Imran Khan MP , former captain of the Pakistan cricket team and now head of his political party Tehreek-e-Insaaf , today pledged his full support for this report . #% This has already happened in Ireland and it could happen in the United Kingdom . #% I represent London where the British Museum is located , but I take a rather softer line than its director on the so-called Elgin Marbles and I hope some arrangement for transfer , even if only a loan , can be reached before next year 's Olympics . #% Whilst I am not of the governing party of the UK , I find it very demeaning that the Council is not here this morning . #% However , national regulation systems which are already in place and functioning for other purposes should be utilised wherever possible to avoid unnecessary duplication and regulation . #% These two countries should be congratulated for their courage and foresight in signing up to these voluntary agreements with the EU . #% Members of the Committee on Fisheries would be grateful for the Commissioner 's answer to our question , bearing in mind that the preliminary statement should be clarified to the fact that what it is stating is that 86 % of all offences are currently covered by administrative sanctions and 14 % by penal ones . #% However , there are a number of proposals that we can not support , as they would introduce additional EU regulations in areas where there would be no demonstrated benefits to the evolution of an effective internal market for financial services . #% This is because the Commissioners took on average nearly ten minutes for each answer . #% I want to pay tribute to your team for having fundamentally reshaped it . #% Mr President , I agree with what has been said that Mrs Daskalaki 's report addresses a critical issue for all of us in democracies . #% I support the President 's proposals that there should not be technical working groups . #% Madam President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , the President of the Commission and the rapporteur for their comments today . #% We will find this is a very difficult thing to calculate and we need time to look at it more closely . #% If this is to be successful , we in the European Parliament must do everything we can to address the root causes of the conflict in Nepal and ensure that there is much greater economic prosperity and much better redistribution of wealth throughout Nepal . #% We should be looking ahead . #% The engine could be old , polluting or spilling oil into the water but , as long as it was in existence at the time the limits were introduced , it would be perfectly legal . #% For all these reasons , I voted against the resolution . #% Was this negligence or was it a criminal attempt to increase the weight of pigs by illegal means ? #% The stress that is put on improving the quality of the information made available so that it is comprehensible , accurate and comparable is also very valuable . #% Russia must now explain how its weapons ended up in the hands of an Islamist fundamentalist militia . #% I want to take up one small point : when I arrived in this House six years ago , unlocking the potential of Europe 's internal market was seen in the context of taking full advantage of e-commerce and the arrival of the euro . #% That is why the UK Independence Party campaigns for the withdrawal of our country from membership of the European Union by repealing the European Communities Act so misguidedly signed by Prime Minister Heath in 1972 . #% Energy saving was not an issue in Europe 50 years ago but it is now and the Council and Parliament agree on that . #% President Obasanjo of Nigeria is currently Chairman of the African Union , and his country must set an example to the international community , and end impunity for bloody tyrants , by handing Taylor over . #% The only democracy to date in the region is Israel , born of a genuine desire to create a Jewish homeland . #% Similarly , controlling the activities of EU armaments companies will inevitably be compromised by the uncontrolled licensing of production outside the EU . #% The French ` rainbow team ' did much to confound the xenophobics and racists who , like Mr Le Pen and our unlamented former colleague Mr M√®gret , believe that to be French is to be white . #% There is a very strong case at this time perhaps for Parliament - and certainly for the Union - to send a new factfinding delegation which could also convey our profound concern and help us to make an even better contribution to resolving the problems of that region . #% That is beginning to change but there is still a long way to go . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Costa , for his excellent work on what is a very difficult , detailed but important dossier . #% As far as mobile air conditioning is concerned , it is disappointing that the committee has failed to take note of those parts of European industry that are already committed to delivering CO2 mobile air conditioning as soon as possible . #% The PPE-DE group opposes the sub-heading ` Maghreb ' after paragraph 33 . #% On the contrary , there is well documented and internationally verified evidence of active and ongoing collusion between the Colombian armed forces and these paramilitary groups . #% But we must always take account of the fact that human rights in Iran are , if anything , getting worse and not better . #% In effect we will be saying that languages spoken by a few hundred people in some cases , and I agree with the support of those languages , are more important to the EU than others spoken by hundreds of thousands . #% David Bowe ' s report is yet further proof of Europe greening up its act and putting the safety of our citizens first . #% We are in the same situation now with the information society . #% We hope that they will now have the confidence in us to let us help ourselves and see all remedies properly examined so that this dreadful disease can be exterminated . #% Accepting this compromise will bring us considerably closer to achieving our goal of an integrated financial market and delivering those benefits to ordinary people right across the European Union . #% Cambodia -- where I was the chief election observer for the European Parliament in the last elections -- is clearly a flawed democracy . #% What are the implications , therefore , of developing the Petersberg Tasks for our national foreign policies and our national capacities to fulfil our ambitions ? #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I hope colleagues will bear with me yet again taking the floor on a question of changes to the Rules of Procedure , which always seem to be on a Monday night . #% Lastly , I welcome Italy 's efforts to robustly secure Europe 's southern frontiers against illegal immigration . #% That is not to say that everything in the public sector has been perfect , but in our view a lot of the claims made for liberalisation in this report are highly questionable . #% We have to find a voice , neither rasping nor sotto voce to raise concerns about the abuse of human and political rights throughout the region and especially in Burma . #% The Council has yet to really think about the post-1999 situation . #% For some businesses EU funding has proved to be an important tool in boosting competitiveness . #% I would also mention the impact this has on the Non-Proliferation Treaty which is due to be reviewed next year because that is based on the premise that existing nuclear powers work towards disarmament . #% Finally , the European Parliament is a central player in the Union 's efforts to cover elections . #% The only things we did agree at that conciliation were two bland statements , one on agriculture , one on category 5 , but Parliament made a unilateral statement concerning the fisheries . #% In general it seeks to extend the reach of CFSP into every area of national foreign policy . #% The following paragraphs contain statements not in line with the balance of evidence presented to the committee or contain errors of fact of lesser importance than those to which amendments were tabled : paragraphs 3 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 20 , 21 , 34 and 57 . #% How then can the European Central Bank set a common interest rate suitable for a Europe with widely varying economies arising from such great geographical diversity and widely differing ways of life ? #% The price of heroin going down would suggest that the supply of heroin is increasing . #% That document is 173 pages long and it lists 29 separate sets of unresolved issues ; these include the strong presumption that 10 000 litres of anthrax still exist . #% So , Commissioner , it is over to you to demonstrate transparency and demonstrate that you recognise the democratic accountability that we all seek . #% In pursuit of more information , therefore , it would be much better if it devoted its energies to pressing for more transparency and openness from the Commission . #% The Commissioner has also intervened recently in the appointment of directors at certain agencies . #% I know at first hand how democracy in Britain has been undermined by our relationship with the European Union and our increasing political integration into a United States of Europe . #% Surely Russia will accuse the European Union of double standards when we rightly demand that they punish those guilty of atrocities in Chechnya whilst we in the EU are giving harbour to these individuals who support terrorist action . #% 
Thank you everyone for signing this written declaration . #% Yet words spoken , written or signed are not in themselves enough . #% Unlike Iraq , which has yet to acquire nuclear weapons , it is now too late to do anything militarily to prevent its nuclear proliferation . #% On Afghanistan , firstly I congratulate Mr Brie on his report on a difficult subject in a difficult country . #% I suppose there was at least a certain honesty about your speech , because you are an unashamed Euro-nationalist . #% We endorse all their efforts so far and would also add our backing to their insistence that 20 % of the payment appropriations go into reserve for the Community INTERREG and URBAN initiatives , pending the satisfactory adoption of the guidelines . #% A ray of hope - albeit a long way off - could be my miracle . #% That parliamentary conference should prepare the ground for the next Intergovernmental Conference . #% The regulation should be a support to free movement , not a barrier , and we hope that our joint work will lead in that direction . #% The current economic crisis has demonstrated that the present economic governance model does not go far enough and can not allow for progressive integration that will ensure the stability of EU economies . #% For every ECU 50m we invest in this way we will make a saving of ECU 100m . #% The balance between the creators of works the producers and the people who exploit them and use them I prefer to say the customers , because that is what they are in the whole arrangement is absolutely crucial . #% I am not complacent about it , but it is a fact . #% This affects children , elderly people and the disabled . #% In the meantime we await developments on those three factors . #% There can be no repeat of the shortcomings that were highlighted in the Court of Auditors report on the 2008 accounts . #% His independent television is the only one that questions the behaviour of Russian troops in Chechnya . #% This is an alarming development and it goes beyond the personal question of Mr Gusinsky , which I have raised before and , as is well known , I am an adviser to him . #% I should like to ask the presidency to look into this and report back to Parliament the full circumstances . #% Secondly , the changes should ensure that career development opportunities for all staff are maximised by removing glass ceilings and rigidities and by providing officials with career guidance , appropriate training and real possibilities for greater mobility both inside the institution and externally . #% Unless they make those choices they will never get to grips with the traffickers . #% This is an informal gentleman 's agreement , as it is called , between the Commission and the Council . #% So the first question is : what might these special circumstances be ? #% Will the President-in-Office also indicate the priority he attaches to improving the delivery of EU aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina ? #% We do have a lot of leverage over Morocco here in the EU , particularly over fishing rights and aid . #% You will , I know , agree that there must never be a ` next time ' , and I would therefore request that tomorrow we remember the events in Rwanda ten years ago and that we have a minute 's silence in support of the need to never stand aside again . #% It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands . #% Members of this Parliament will be aware of the very high degree of public interest in this issue and of the lobbying to which we have all been subjected . #% On behalf of the Socialist Group , I have tabled amendments to attempt to correct these distortions . #% This should do something to combat the secrecy element . #% On enlargement , as Mr F√§rm has already indicated , capacity is a key element that we must work on in the next 12 months . #% I would also suggest further study of the impact of the measures where appropriate , but with a view to ensuring full , tough and timely international implementation . #% It is extremely important that the growth of our European security and defence policy commands full public support and respect , and strong and credible parliamentary scrutiny is certainly the way forward . #% Are there any circumstances in which you think the peoples of Europe should have a referendum so that they can decide these issues ? #% We call on President Pastrana not simply to attack fraud and corruption but also to promulgate that bill . #% Now - and in spite of Colombian President Pastrana 's concession three years ago of a large demilitarised zone the size of Switzerland , where 17 000 of its guerrillas roam at will - the FARC , instead of pursuing a legitimate , peacefully negotiated settlement , continues its policy of kidnapping and murdering civilians . #% Even then , should they overstep their powers , it is possible to go to the Court to seek to verify whether the principle of subsidiarity has been overstepped or not . #% I sincerely hope that this is the last time that this House has to address this issue as I trust that Member States will fulfil their duties under the law and under International Convention . #% I close by saying that last Thursday evening I went with one of my colleagues , Lambert van Nistelrooij from Holland , to Oxford University . #% Yes , I am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow . #% in writing . - While I am in favour of the maximum objectivity in analysing Europe 's history , and while I recognise the horrific nature of the crimes of Stalinist Russia , I am afraid that this resolution has elements of a historical revisionism that flies in the face of a demand for objective analysis . #% Let us tackle what the citizens are asking us head on . #% Yesterday also marked another significant event . #% Now , the rationale for all this is that the EU is a large trading bloc and because of this clout , the EU is able to negotiate a trade treaty that would not be open to a Member State to negotiate on its own . #% Similarly , the stability pact must be given its full title . #% If we make a comparison of Europe and the US in the areas of business generation and equity financing , particularly amongst small businesses , then venture capital activity demonstrates a huge gap in Europe 's readiness to compete . #% Mr President , the development of the European public health policy has now reached a very important stage . #% We have heard that provision varies from Member State to Member State in terms of the protection afforded to temporary agency workers . #% The local populations are being left without any hope of earning a living and I am very disappointed that you will not at least promise us an inquiry . #% The resolution is at least a statement of our position on our relations with our great neighbour , and for Parliament not to have expressed itself upon this important subject would have been to have failed to shoulder its responsibility as an international parliament , and a sad sign that the policy of Fortress Europe is alive and carries more support than it deserves to inside this Assembly . #% The first will be in the report that Karl von Wogau writes for us where he will look in detail at the information that comes from the European Monetary Institute and the Commission . #% We are certainly not in favour of amendments which constantly refer to keeping costs down . #% We need to be careful of the nostrum that problems can be solved by simply throwing money at them . #% Mr Nattrass made some very personal remarks against me before sneaking out of the Chamber without listening to the debate . #% That is the right sort of focus for us in this situation . #% Yet I hear nothing other than euphemisms , such as that we must maintain our influence and continue our dialogue . #% In addition , of course , the Commission is manifestly ready to inform the relevant parliamentary committees whenever it is invited to do so . #% One of my main concerns centred on the familiar subject of subsidarity , already mentioned by the previous speaker . #% A common and uniform and centralised standard on how you climb a ladder is not necessary and it is an undesirable interference with the way people run their work environment . #% The EU should use its development assistance and other external powers to pursue the objective of binding minimum standards with respect to the social and environmental performance of companies . #% And my goodness me , Mr Barroso , you could do with a few successes , could you not ? #% I hope that , amongst other products of activity-based management and budgeting and the transparency that Mr Virrankoski spoke about , we will see a further evolution of the readiness of the Commission to make maximum disclosure whilst trying to safeguard the integrity of necessary procedures . #% Discussing the procedures is key to understanding this case and deciding if the European Arrest Warrant is being misused and abused . #% I wish to make two comments with respect to the reports in front of us ; one on the Belder report , which contains a version of an amendment which I have tabled concerning the treatment of the Russian-speaking minorities in Estonia and Latvia . #% Therefore under Rule 146 , 32 Members can set the specific time and date when this debate should resume . #% Two are Europeans and it is highly likely , as a consequence of appeals from seven Member States , that they will have their sentence of death commuted , possibly to a term of imprisonment . #% 
Lifestyle , as well as genetics , can apparently affect the likelihood of getting breast cancer . #% As the rapporteur said earlier , with the compromise amendments - the set of amendments passed by our committee - I am sure that we have the right directive at the right time . #% I am very disappointed that my own Foreign Secretary has apparently been against this transparency . #% Precisely because in this Treaty of Nice there is no further transfer of competence to the European Union . #% Our allies in the United States are heavily committed in the fight against terrorism and we should do everything reasonable to support them . #% I look forward to returning to the debate and I hope Mr Jarzembowski is happy with himself because I am not sure that I am . #% Well , yes , we will , but that is not our fault . #% As has been said , I drafted the opinion for the Committee on Employment , where we focused on those people who were effectively trafficked for labour purposes . #% If there is a good service there , then we surely need to tell more people about it ; and if resources are needed and the problems are at Member State level , we need to try and address that . #% The longer-term effects are even more serious , as Commissioner Dimas indicated , since deforestation , of which illegal logging is a major driver , accounts for nearly one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions . #% It would make it so weak that it would be one that we could not support . #% Can we from the European Union - those of us who are members and non-members - strengthen the Nato-Euro-Atlantic Alliance , since it is still a fundamental guarantee for European stability ? #% This report by Mrs in ' t Veld does not accept that analysis limiting state aids , in my opinion , unreasonably . #% Some arms brokers are legitimate businesses ; many , however , are little more than merchants of death . #% So I would beg the Presidency in this regard simply to use the strategy as a starting point for much more detailed work on sustainability . #% Mr Berlusconi wisely refers positively to the wider European debate . #% author . - Mr President , it saddens me to have to take the floor once again on this issue . #% It is perhaps appropriate that I should now begin my parliamentary duties with reference to Indonesia and another State that is in creation - East Timor . #% These deficiencies must now be addressed to give workers the effective tools they need . #% It is worth making that clear because if you then consider the commercial interests at stake , it becomes even more incomprehensible why the US is single-handedly blocking agreement in this area . #% If such information is instantly disclosable as `` inside information '' it would make hedging impossible and the derivatives markets would grind to a halt . #% I would repeat the point I made earlier . #% An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union . #% But it is symbolic of the European Union 's experience . #% I would like to remind Parliament and Commission that this is the programme which provides the core funding to enable disabled people , and indeed other groups that are discriminated against , to meet and to represent themselves at European level . #% I have to say that legitimate concerns about military capabilities are not resolved by the Europeanisation of defence , which responds to an essentially political agenda and is an aspect of the process of European political integration . #% Britain , Ireland , Denmark and Norway all had rich coastal fisheries and they had been kept in good condition by effective conservation measures . #% Today 's vote on the Motion of Censure was a farce . #% But the SLIM process ought to go much further . #% To lose a creature that has changed very little in tens of millions of years would not only be a tragedy but would further change the ecology of the waters , upsetting a balance already damaged by over-fishing and certainly entailing damaging consequences . #% We ask the Council to look again at whether this small contribution , which would buy a couple of flats in London , should not be made to enable us to have that political impact . #% We can not offer our citizens a second-rate service . #% The majority of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs supported the Commission in upholding the 1951 Geneva Convention , which does not differentiate between different actors of persecution , and welcomed the move away from the narrow view held by some governments and parties that only state persecution creates official refugees . #% The inclusion of third-country nationals seems to me to be recognition of the principle of equal treatment of those who contribute to the economic and social life of the Union . #% That is the route we should be seeking from this year on . #% We do not want to see the continuation of problems like those we have had at Sangatte in France . #% That is something that I hope the Commission will approach as a whole and not just , on a point of order , the equal opportunities of women . #% Fourth , from a European perspective , the best of independent actors - renowned non-governmental organisations like Oxfam or the Save the Children Fund from the UK , M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res from France and so on - have helped to deliver public support to the whole notion of development , as well as providing a record for ensuring the swiftest , most direct and efficient provision of aid which , in itself , commands that public support . #% We place great emphasis not only upon the improvement of the quality of drafting , but also upon reducing somewhat the quantity . #% Mercury must be disposed of and stored safely in order to protect human health and the environment . #% I hope that this House will continue to show the same commitment . #% It will not diminish political responsibility , portfolio responsibility or policy engagement : it is likely to add to those . #% Our delegation on Central Asia covers all the countries of Central Asia and Mongolia . #% That seems to me an unacceptable position for any country that claims to respect human rights . #% I have come to this debate today almost directly from a meeting with the relations of people who have lost children to new variant CJD , the human form of BSE . #% What seemed like an extremely logical system at the time to the majority of Parliament -- not to all of us -- has real problems that need addressing . #% Clearly this will not be dealt with in a general discussion about Kosovo . #% It is because lifetime use has to be considered in the light of the intensity of the intake . #% There is no smile on the faces of those anti-war demonstrators who were arrested on 20 March in Cairo and reportedly tortured . #% While we support many of the sentiments and specific collaborative ideas in this report , we have decided to abstain on the final vote as it calls for the ` identification of a legal basis for combating violence ... under current European legislation ' . #% However , with regard to the review , I asked the Commissioner in a written question if the review could still go ahead . #% British Labour members of the PES have voted in support of the Lambert report . #% So I can only think that she is misinformed and , on that generous basis , I look forward to negotiating sincerely and in good faith with the EPP and with all other groups . #% We had our own reasons for rejection . #% With this proposal we would see a substantial reduction in that fraction of emissions . #% The continuing economic difficulties in the eurozone are one of the many reasons why the UK should not abolish its national currency either . #% Then we have Parliament 's attitude towards redeployment in Category I. Similarly , we have to consider our approach to the use of the flexibility instrument if it was invoked for Serbia , as you suggest . #% There is a case to answer here and a case that may need to be answered to the international community , but starting in this Parliament . #% Forgive me for being cynical , but it also appears to be a handy way for the EU to promote itself as a caring organisation . #% However , whatever happens to those particular amendments , I am quite confident that there will be a successful outcome in the vote tomorrow . #% There is increased and increasing competition for qualified international staff in many areas including multilingual , multi-skilled secretaries , IT specialists , scientific researchers , international trade and market specialists , competition lawyers , financial experts of every kind and many more . #% Does the proposal include private executive aircraft which are proliferating increasingly ? #% We also need to think of the entire range of medical science , including those newest areas , like complementary medicine , which can play their part . #% Regardless of the technological and material advantages that will accrue , this political dimension is vital in itself . #% Conservatives back home , however , are coming up with this idea that this Treaty sets up a superstate . #% Where I must express grave concern , as others have done , is in the Council 's substandard consultation with Parliament , and alleged Commission delays . #% 
Lastly , it is very dangerous for consumers , as it will create a monopoly situation in the product market with subsequent price increases . #% The chasm between the EU and its citizens is growing all the time . #% I wonder whether , in his reply to the debate , the Commissioner might dwell on this point and indicate how he sees the national Europass centres successfully undertaking this work ? #% Hizbollah has a lot of explaining to do as to why its deliberate provocation has caused so much damage to Lebanese infrastructure , with the deaths of so many Lebanese civilians . #% I also hope that the EU takeover of military responsibility will lead to an energetic effort to find war criminals and deliver them to The Hague . #% It is so important for the future of the European economy as a whole that we get this package right . #% The wording within those paragraphs is very significant , especially in paragraph 26 , which mentions encouraging national parliaments to be involved in monitoring European Union funds . #% As Commissioner - or Commissioner-designate - this is probably the last time you will sit here on a budgets issue . #% We need her to do so ; indeed , in the vote that will take place tomorrow we call on her to do so . #% That is why we have to trouble the House to vote tomorrow to get closer to the original report and delete most of those amendments , except of course my own ! #% This will be highly necessary when we come to set the next financial perspective : we must not be found wanting in this particular area of external policy . #% The original European Parliament proposal for the budget was EUR 25 million and the dilemma I faced was how to reach some sort of compromise that was not delayed so long that it would prevent the money reaching its necessary targets . #% I hope that you will support this directive , and that you will support the thrust of the Legal Affairs Committee 's amendments . #% We can only do that if we are united in our assessment of what constitutes full respect for human rights and if we are credible through consistency between what we do at home and say abroad . #% Those 63 people did not become names under the present regulatory regime , but in the pre-2001 period . #% Iran 's leaders , however , should be in no doubt about the universal horror felt by us about the barbaric and medieval Sharia punishment of stoning to death . #% That is something of which we must be ashamed and we must pledge ourselves to show our guilt by stopping the recruitment rape and by ensuring that we can sustain , with the people of Africa , the health services and the health professionals they so desperately need . #% In addition , provisions with regard to this ought to be contained in the forthcoming Member 's Statute . #% Finally , it will save the European taxpayer EUR 150 million a year . #% Finally , there would be a short , sharp IGC to approve the results at the end . #% The second issue concerns freedom of dealers and their ability to invest . #% Madam President , I also refer to the point of order that was raised about the nuclear submarine in Gibraltar . #% We also want to give them an incentive to do so . #% When we finish celebrating , we ought to realise that all we have done is reach the end of the beginning of the EU . #% Mr President , Commissioner Bolkestein invited us to take a positive view of the Commission 's action in the 17 February joint statement . #% Is the Council aware that the management committee of the Monitoring Centre has passed a resolution expressing regret at the resignation of Professor Pelinka and the events leading to that resignation and is the Council prepared to draw the attention of the Wise Men to this particular incident and ask them to include that in their report because it clearly seems to be a possible example of how our common European values are being undermined by the current government in Austria ? #% I need to answer their immediate worries and fears , and I want to be able to tell them that they will be able to keep their jobs , that new jobs will soon start to be created and that these jobs will be decent jobs with decent salaries . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , on behalf of my Group , I particularly wanted to welcome all the reports , but especially the report from Mr Grech , for which I was the shadow rapporteur in the committee . #% The question could equally well be applied to the whole of Central and South America and the rest of the economically developing world . #% I also think that when we are looking at the quality of education we need to see if it is delivering real equality of opportunity for all of those within the system or whether it is doing , as society does , so much to exclude people on grounds of a poor background or their colour or whatever . #% Mr President , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , I wish to congratulate Mr Paasilinna on his report , which we very much welcome . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the ECR Group fully supports Icelandic accession to the European Union , although the decision is firmly a matter for Icelanders alone in a referendum . #% Mr President , Burma and Nigeria are obviously , geographically , thousands of miles apart . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this . #% I hope the Commission will look at the initial results of those trials to see whether this technology is an alternative , more cost-effective way of achieving the aims that we want . #% I welcome foreign minister de Palacio 's support yesterday for the British and American position . #% This situation has now persisted for over five years and , despite Commission promises for action on the excluded sectors , we actually have nothing . #% I am pleased with the recent attention the subject has been receiving at EU level . #% We welcome a resolution by this Parliament that encourages the Sri Lankan President and Government to return to the co-habitation that had prevailed since the last general election in Sri Lanka . #% This resolution , like many before it in this House , chronicles the brutal repression of the Burmese people led by a military junta they never elected and have fought very hard to get rid of for many years . #% The committee has been at pains throughout this process to point out and highlight the importance of the internal market dimension of this proposal which gives us a chance to ensure even more strongly than before that our businesses and citizens can have confidence that contracts and obligations they enter into across the Union will be upheld by a common framework of procedural law on jurisdiction and enforcement . #% Indeed , it is only a few months ago that EU leaders agreed to proscribe export credit guarantees to Iran . #% The tragedy of this failed revolution , brutally put down by Soviet imperial troops with the death of thousands , is that it closed down an evolutionary path out of Soviet oppression to engagement with the rest of the world , a slow but sure path to pluralism and democracy . #% It may or may not have made any difference but certainly it will not have done the Parliamentary delegation any good service . #% The consumer should be able to support home production , if this is their wish . #% So the report does not concern just terrorism but these other matters too . #% That said , the report rightly draws attention to the difficulties of doing no more than establishing minimum criteria for voluntary schemes . #% Having accepted the urgent need to reform the Commission 's accounting system along the lines suggested by its former Chief Accountant , Marta Andreasen - who was in post just four months and working in what was supposedly a hostile environment - and with your understanding , as Commissioner for Reform , that reforms often take longer than expected to deliver , conceive , plan and actually put into action , surely now you can accept that it is time to stop victimising Marta Andreasen and stop these ridiculous disciplinary proceedings against her . #% I congratulate Mrs Jackson on the work she has undertaken . #% We are delighted by the extent to which the report addresses our concerns and commend its content to the Commission , recognising , with thanks to the Commissioner , that she has already touched on some of these issues in her introduction . #% This will allow us to drive forward the comprehensive reassessment of the EU 's revenue and expenditure and shake up the system in order to create momentum for adapting our political priorities . #% But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company ' s decision . #% I should like to thank Mr McCartin for his very erudite presentation . #% I would put it to the presidency that we already have an International Convention on Hallmarking of precious metals , which the European Union could accede to and which would provide a proven system of consumer protection without the necessity of moving in a direction that , as he knows , many countries oppose . #% I received this letter yesterday morning after enquiries had been made . #% The Committee on Development has proposed that all regional budget lines contribute to achieving the sizeable recurrent contribution needed . #% I visited the hostel in question in Brittany with Caroline Dickinson 's father earlier this month and saw a very low level of security at that time , which has been improved , but obviously too late . #% Nor do Mr Farage or the Conservative Party provide a preferable or alternative solution . #% As well as codifying conditions under which the owner can drive , the micro-chip could store useful information as suggested already concerning the willingness to donate organs , as well as medical requirements and needs of the driver himself . #% Our safeguards against any attempt by the state to interfere in freedoms and rights go back hundreds of years and are protected by common and statute law . #% Did the French sign up to the Florence agreement ? #% We welcome in particular the annual report that will detail the number of documents not listed from each institution , which will hopefully stop institutional creep from taking place , as year after year they add further and further categories of documents that will remain secret . #% It is very important that we retain a sense of perspective , a sense of proportion about this issue and I welcome the balanced response from Commissioner Wallstr√∂m . #% The annual report , for example , of the United Kingdom customs and excise published yesterday shows a # 1 billion shortfall in tobacco receipts alone . #% Even worse to my mind has been the slighting reference to the work of the officials who prepare employment statistics . #% -- Mr President , the ability to control one 's borders and decide who should be a citizen in your country is one of the most basic characteristics of a nation state , and in that regard the UK is very lucky because we are not part of the continent of Europe . #% 
We have irreversible damage in prospect for the habitats of a large number of species from eagles to woodpeckers , to capercaillie , wolves and lynx . #% On a number of occasions this week the Members bar has had in it visitors from outside Parliament and , actually , just members of the public . #% There is still a view that there is not really any racism in Europe . #% So we do recognize and acknowledge Mr Liikanen 's approach at penitence on behalf of the institution , even though we all accept that he was not directly responsible . #% Events in Toulouse and in Enschede have demonstrated the need for action to amend and reinforce the existing Directive , so as to avoid any possibility of accidents and to minimise damage should an accident occur . #% My 22 November letters to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp therefore related entirely to such legal obligations and considerations and to absolutely nothing else . #% The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but , over the years , it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions . #% All have called for an end to the suffering , yet Israel has changed nothing . #% My question is this : is it correct that the decision within the Council on which documents are to be released to the public and which are kept secret is made by a committee of the 15 press officers from the national representation offices by a majority vote ? #% Mr President , I too would like to start by welcoming the Commission ' s strategy for the run-up to the election that has just been set out by the Commissioner and , in particular , the training of the Zimbabwean election monitors . #% The vote for that was carried because the British Labour Government refused my constituents an inquiry into that terrible disease . #% My question is Question No 32 on the list , but you have already answered by saying that it will be answered in writing . #% Last week in Florence he said that national governments were giving in to populist temptations . #% There is a long tradition of political campaigning through boycotts : Barclays over South Africa , Nestl√© over breast milk substitutes and Shell over both Brent Spar and Kabinda . #% When they sought and obtained this patent , which they did for entirely lawful purposes , they did so in good faith . #% What do they fear ? #% The notion that you can tender for piloting services for ships of that description in order to secure the lowest price is , again , ludicrous . #% Several weeks ago , the North Korean Ambassador to Berlin spoke to Parliament 's new delegation for relations with the Korean Peninsula and indicated that North Korea would welcome our participation , as would the Chinese and the South Koreans . #% That is very important . #% It is deeply inadequate what you have done . #% But this technology also constitutes a breach of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention which requires states to take all measures that are necessary to prevent , reduce and control pollution in the marine environment from any source . #% I want to say to the Commissioner that considerable attention has to be given to ensuring that the rules for this new company statute are consistently implemented across the Member States . #% We do , as I say , welcome the efforts to close Guant√°namo , but we oppose military commissions and other continuing abuses . #% Is it really for the benefit of the consumer ? #% I could tell you a great deal about this situation -- over 1000 European Union citizens a year , allegedly , going to poorer countries in the world to seek human organs , whether it be India , Pakistan , Albania or some of the other countries that have been referred to . #% The rapporteur has struck the right compromise : the ban would not be immediate but could come into force in five years , and that means that , in effect , we have given the companies concerned at least 15 years ' notice since we first started discussing this about ten years ago . #% The difficulty lies in determining how to fund a venture until it becomes self-financing , particularly in view of the large sums of upfront investments required . #% The House has rules and it has precedents , and some of us who have been here a little longer have been through all this before . #% We are worried not only about the effects that congestion has in terms of inconvenience and the implications for the economic stability of our Union , but we are also concerned first and foremost about threats to safety that may result from it . #% This must address the issue of pro-enterprise and a pro-opportunity agenda with measures to encourage enterprise

the freedom to eat and to work . #% It is imperative that we think seriously about how to foster and strengthen the transatlantic relationship today . #% Its deadline must be extended if we are not to conclude that government ministers have already decided in favour of GM cultivation . #% We were told there would be an enormous outlay of EUR 6 billion , and now the Commissioner says that a minimum of EUR 22.75 billion will be made available for the 2006-2013 period . #% It is therefore a matter of much regret that the UK Government 's process has been under-funded and badly publicised . #% We shall deal with the consultation in that area in due course . #% You also said that the budget should have the same discipline as national budgets . #% Unfortunately , we live in an increasingly throw-away society where we produce more and more waste . #% Account to Parliament annually for the stewardship of the remit . #% You do not have to be good at mathematics to work out that , unless we

rapporteurs because the work they have done has helped us tremendously . #% Previously the Commission had told us that funds from the Euratom Treaty would be sufficient for the decommissioning . #% So here we have another summit , another crisis , confidence in the euro ebbing by the week . #% An organisation with any sense of honour would have respected the French and Dutch referendum results and there would have been a complete halt to further integration . #% I do not believe it would be a legitimate act for a British Government to sign us up to the Constitution on behalf of our people on these terms , and in those circumstances I should be perfectly happy not to qualify for this funding . #% I think I have tabled this question to you and also a whole host of journalists have asked you this . #% I also welcome Mr Frattini 's statement that finding out the truth will strengthen our fight against terrorism by upholding our values . #% Mr President , this report on the strengthening of world monetary cooperation to ensure better regulation of monetary and financial markets is very timely . #% It was my request in the Agriculture Committee that we had a debate on this and I much appreciate your coming . #% The acceptable daily intake - the ADI - is not only the favoured measurement of the FAO and WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives , but it also sets an intake level - not a maximum for a single day , but an average over a lifetime . #% Now that we can see the ministers on television I look forward to seeing the embarrassment as you point your finger at them , Minister , one by one , and ask them for an explanation as to why those plans have not been submitted . #% Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky , which is the best - requires water extraction which is used

consistently neglects trade relations with the Commonwealth , of which Canada is a founder member . #% Both these instances refer to speeches made by Mr Bossi on various occasions but speeches where , on one interpretation , he appears to be using inflammatory language which could be encouraging other citizens to act in a way that perhaps would not be appropriate . #% A `` yes '' vote should be for

#% Security is also improving for all our continent , as all acceding countries bar Malta and Cyprus , which I particularly welcome as British Commonwealth states , will shortly be joining Nato . #% That is a total disgrace , about which we should hang our heads in shame . #% After suffering as we have , in our country , we are alarmed to see the disease still rampant in some other European countries . #% You actually argued almost to the contrary that in actual fact the standing committee on scientific evidence is probably not as good as a food agency . #% We know , of course , that we have to take account of the local populations and their traditions and needs , and that is in this resolution . #% In the past , the President could use his or her discretion : for example , you , Mr President , could have chosen to limit the number of right-wing Catholics that you wished to allow to speak , thus giving a better balance . #% First of all Amendment No 5 relating to the working time of junior doctors in training . #% But I have one specific question : why are only eight or nine NGOs , as far as my information is concerned , funded through these two lines ? #% Mr President , I ask that when we have a moment of solemn silence it should mean silence for the cameramen and everybody in this Chamber and not just for those on the ground floor . #% Again , will the Council comment on emergency preparations in place if that should transpire ? #% Of this scant EUR 2 support for Europe ' s cultural heritage will be less than 20 cents . #% in writing . - The persecution of Christians in Islamic countries , and some non-Islamic countries such as communist China , is a growing and despicable trend . #% If it does , then where are the vaccines for everyone else ? #% I would urge the Council to instruct the Commission at Amsterdam , once we have the chapter on employment and once we have a pact that balances stability with growth , to come forward with a new model of development that ensures that we can tackle the unemployment problem and social exclusion and to try to help make this a Europe worthy of our citizens . #% The European Union says a great deal about its support for small and medium-sized enterprises , but it is exactly such a company in my constituency that has been having great difficulty in accessing money from the European Investment Bank precisely to expand and provide additional jobs in an Objective 5b area . #% The German police anti-hooligan task force has said that it is pretty confident there will be hooligans there . #% But border disputes between Kyrgyzstan and its neighbours are delaying the process of frontier delimitation with Tajikistan in particular , but also with Uzbekistan . #% It is no good having a road network if the parking spaces are not there for disabled people . #% With vast oil revenues at his disposal , he was able to dispense largesse in return for political acquiescence throughout Europe and Africa , not least in my own country , the United Kingdom , particularly under the previous government . #% I urge colleagues to reject that amendment . #% author . - Mr President , once again , we are debating China , and its government 's intolerance of dissent . #% It was very difficult . #% As a result of that , we thought the matter was resolved . #% I have to say that I am bemused that the rapporteur , despite his eloquence , sees Article 290 as a solution . #% In many ways the new team offers a breath of fresh air . #% I would have thought that if we can sort out divorce we can sort out deaths . #% This EU dimension consists of social and legal justice inspired by the fundamental provisions of the EU Treaties , and hard-headed self-interest for the European economy and society . #% When a survey was conducted of state schools in India , some were simply shut . #% Yet the cost need not be prohibitive , and our report points to examples of inexpensive interventions and changes of local practice which can make a significant difference . #% We welcome the measures taken by the European Council since the attacks and we are playing our part in putting them swiftly into effect . #% Do the Info-Points help meet that need ? #% Of all the problems with the common fisheries policy , throwing healthy fish overboard is the one that the general public in Europe see as particularly ridiculous . #% We are told that there are still thousands of illegal landfills in France , Italy and other countries . #% author . - Mr President , I think it would be better if we circulated them later . #% Mr President , last Christmas the Council voted for Turkey when it agreed that accession negotiations could begin on 3 October 2005 , provided certain conditions were met . #% I could not be there , but they did express their thanks for the way he kept them informed . #% Thus , Amendment No 6 , while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations , requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission . #% To succeed , progress must be based on epidemiological and economic criteria which have been worked out in the rather difficult passage of these proposals to this stage . #% This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions . #% Debt relief is key to achieving the millennium development goals . #% At the weekend I am going to Africa -- Swaziland -- and Mauritius to look again at the issues related to sugar there . #% Parliament was able to vote on this in committee . #% Again , welcome to the British Labour President-in-Office . #% Amendment No 16 addresses this problem , which was highlighted to me by the cabin crew themselves and even some airlines . #% Mr President , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , which Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens has just referred to , stressed very strongly the need for consumer protection . #% I have one issue that I wish to raise , following on from today 's mine attack which resulted in the deaths of two civilians and the injury of 12 soldiers . #% I suppose that means we intend to plant these ridiculous wind farms on them . #% Above all , the Kashmiri people should be involved in this process . #% I fully support Mr Pirker and I hope we make strong moves now to conclude this matter in the interests of everybody . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Labour members of the Socialist Group I wish to inform you that we were unable to vote in favour of the Tampere resolution in its final form . #% The key question is how we turn the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit into action ; we must ensure that we turn the rhetoric of Lisbon into a reality . #% The point , surely , is that organised crime bleeds the European economy ; these criminals are stealing billions from us in various different ways . #% Not all air conditioning systems are mobile : some of them are in stationary applications such as buildings like this one . #% It actually specifies that it does not apply to crew members solely assigned to non-safety duties . #% In particular , it indicates the more or less complete impossibility of reconciling our language policy with the needs of those who use and work with patents . #% This is an example of what the EU should be doing - exchanging best practice in areas such as volunteering rather than creating more and more needless bureaucracy . #% Now that we have this resolution , we can open negotiations with the Council on the Members ' Statute . #% We must take up the Austrian proposal for a diabetes framework ; we must work hard on the Commission 's own proposal on mental health . #% You should accept that one of the reasons that the Commission puts forward so many ill-considered , ill-thought out , inappropriate and ill-drafted proposals , which we in England and other countries have to put up with , is the lack of transparency . #% Mr Anastassopoulos ' report points the way . #% The tragedy is that 18 months on , bombings , attacks and rapes are still taking place , despite the best efforts of the African Union both in the Abuja peace talks and on the ground in Darfur . #% The international community needs to redouble its efforts to reconvene the roadmap to enable a two-state solution with a viable , contiguous state of Palestine , based approximately on the 1967 borders , and a secure Israel living in peaceful , neighbourly coexistence . #% I guess in some ways the Commission provides an open target on which people can vent their complaints , especially when there is cause to believe that some difficulties have been encountered because of accidental not malevolent omissions . #% 
There are those who use the same arguments as we sometimes hear on AIDS , saying that we can forget about those people who are infected , but should protect and save the rest . #% If I am asked about the burden of new regulations which Parliament sometimes places upon industry in the cause of environmental improvement , I will proclaim this directive as an example of the way in which industry and Parliament can work together . #% This is just one example - there will be many more - of sound practice which can enhance the day-to-day lives of all of us . #% That is why we have the Hague Convention on Inter-Country Adoption . #% I want to highlight a few aspects of the text . #% Suspicions by the consumers that the euro will be used to mask price hikes must be zealously tackled and tripped up . #% And I believe that one of the proudest achievements of the European Union and its Member States in the last decade was the establishment of the International Criminal Court . #% Mr President , could you give us some indication what action the European Parliament will now take on this very serious matter ? #% This just has not happened . #% We are now entering a new era . #% With the Scientific Committee having ruled on Friday that British beef is safe , it seems incredible that we have this further delay . #% Get rid of us ! #% Yet India 's economy remains full of paradoxes . #% An in-depth study by the Commission on highlighting the practical aspects of the EMU for SMEs is essential . #% As far as amendments to my report are concerned , I do not support either of the two amendments that have been tabled . #% However , it would be wrong to prescribe the type of technology . #% Letters from the Hague Conference have gone unanswered , and this sends a very poor message to parents and others who would wish to take advantage of this convention , both in the Community and in third countries . #% I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to engage in a close dialogue with the European Parliament as well as our international partners , in order to establish a sounder basis for globalisation . #% I have been asked to do this as a formality , even though it is included in colleagues ' voting lists . #% But much of this will depend on the detail as concluded in the negotiations themselves . #% Now we find that the whole time-consuming process was a meaningless charade . #% I am particularly concerned about the level of youth unemployment . #% There are over ten major manufacturers producing cars in Europe and spending billions on research and development . #% We had many problems getting the information out of the Commission , for the simple reason that the Commission did not have the information because the Member States had failed to furnish it . #% Crucially this agreement also confirms the freedom that issuers of bonds have to go to different EU regulators for the approval of their prospectus , so long as the minimum denomination is EUR 1000 or more or , importantly , a nearly equivalent amount in other currencies , so that USD 1000 can also be a minimum amount . #% It is a positive report , supported unanimously in the Committee on Budgetary Control , and I hope the Commission will acknowledge it for what it is - a sensible approach to working jointly to attack the twin problems we have to face . #% Two researchers belonging to the Independence and Democracy Group were physically assaulted -- one was kicked and punched . #% Mr President , I am very much in favour of a developing common foreign and security policy in the European Union . #% Mr Evan 's report seems to observe both those goals . #% I feel certain that we have managed to do this in a way that does not compromise public health , because public health is the precise aim of this piece of legislation . #% However , all this will emerge in due course . #% Mr President , I have basically left it open to all members of the Budgetary Control Committee to suggest amendments in the sectors that they tend to cover . #% We look forward to a full debate this afternoon to enable us to kick-start , with the real dimension it deserves , a proper transatlantic relationship in the post-Iraq context . #% But , clearly , Member States and their role will be fully respected in terms of their rights to determine their own taxation levels . #% Books published elsewhere in the Community , in whatever language , should be able to be imported and sold according to the rules in force and the place of publication . #% The internal market needs to be reinvigorated and extended to new fields . #% We can find a legal basis . #% It has been over a year since the Council pledged to end the isolation of Turkish Cypriots in the wake of their two-thirds ` yes ' vote to the UN 's Annan Plan for a political settlement . #% As you know , in the preliminary draft budget some ECU 6m has been allowed under heading B 34102 for 1997 . #% In my part of Europe 3 million people are on illegal drugs , that includes 28 % of 16-29 year-olds and 14 % of 14-15 year-olds . #% I would like to congratulate the Commission on producing for the first time a three-year perspective with a clear view forward and a series of important and coherent policies to make the single market work better . #% Secondly , as Mr Barroso observed this morning , there is a structural problem in the budget . #% Today , we need to know why it has taken so long for action to be taken against those Member States who have failed . #% I hope that after this debate we can work harder to make sure that we can demonstrate to the European taxpayer that value for money is being given . #% I hope the entire House will reaffirm its support for the work of the Office by supporting the PPE-DE amendments and the PSE/ALDE amendments . #% It is important that the UK gets an extension to give it time to review the situation , to evaluate the risks of the continued use of cooking oil , although personally I think they are insignificant , and to put in place systems for alternative uses such as biodiesel . #% Moving to the working time directive : in my view this is bad legislation . #% If national courts are given powers to impose penalties on drivers ' licences issued in other countries , the prospect of a Greek court banning , or attempting to ban , a British driver from driving in Britain will cause a row the like of which even you have not yet experienced from Britain ! #% However , like so many others , I endorse it with some reservations . #% We should be encouraged by the fact that the issue is back where it belongs , that is at scientific and at veterinary level . #% Firstly , despite my fondness for my former parliamentary colleague , Neil Kinnock , my party and I made a commitment at the European elections that we would not support any Commission which had within it previous members . #% Why then , in view of all these things , have we been represented since 1973 by the EEC , the EC , the EU and no doubt , if the Constitution is adopted , the United States of Europe ? #% Personally , I can understand that there are times when concessions are necessary , but not these compromises , not now in a Europe where there is an obvious need for economic reform . #% They , along with so many others , are also victims . #% As Commissioner Mar√≠n has pointed out , ultimately the path to peace lies as much with economic development as with international diplomacy . #% I do not believe that large legitimate manufacturers should have to pay the costs created by other companies , whether they be free-riders or small organisations . #% The same applies to applicant countries . #% If there has been a guarantor of peace over the last 50 years , surely it must be NATO , an example of intergovernmental cooperation . #% However , certain grey areas need to be clarified , such as reasonable accommodation or reasonable adjustment . #% You yourself said that time is running out . #% I certainly feel , having read his report , that I understand it very much better . #% Some countries have tried to exploit the situation to their own advantage . #% This report will do nothing . #% I would also like to add my voice and that of my group to what we have heard from Mr Zappal√† and Mrs Roure about its implications , not just in Malta but in various other places our delegation has visited , including Dublin . #% That ECU 350 million will be redistributed throughout category 3 . #% A few of us were Members of this House in the 1980s , when we had turbulent budget debates that were not over-affected by the limits imposed , and then had the financial perspectives from 1988 . #% 
If the EU wants a place in the `` premier division '' of industrial growth and competition , then funding the industries of tomorrow is of vital importance . #% With regard to the spending of money external to the Union , particularly in Eastern and Central Europe , we would hope that the Commission will focus its efforts , particularly through the Phare Programme and other projects guaranteeing the implementation and enforcement of European Union legislation . #% Here EU efforts brokered a peace settlement and a peace process that ended a 30-year-long civil war at the cost of less than a few hours ' spending in Iraq . #% The mechanisms for ensuring this already exist in the form of the United Nations and its various agencies . #% This is one of the only areas under the Treaty where it is the Parliament and not the Commission which has the right of initiative . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Santini , who I have been shadowing on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists . #% Would the compensation mentioned in Mr Sterckx apply to all of that and , in any case , who pays ? #% In doing this , we must put particular pressure on the KLA . #% However , a failure will seriously undermine the principles in this development policy communication and I appeal to him from the floor of the House to continue the dialogue before we reach a set of difficult votes in forthcoming weeks . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , the ALDE Group thanks Mr Musotto for his very valuable report on the natural and economic constraints affecting islands . #% We look forward to eventual Turkish membership of the EU . #% Of course there are areas of concern and Mr Cushnahan has outlined some of them . #% The Commission is aware of the particular political importance of the year ahead and , in response to the honourable Member 's question , I would make the following points . #% There is something wrong with our electronic voting system . #% That is essential to the political accountability of the system . #% Mr President , I am sorry to be taking up so much of colleagues ' time but it shows the interest we have in each other ' s measures . #% We have the means to address that problem by supporting the Commissioner 's proposal for a 50 milligramme limit - a proposal , I understand , that has been on the table now for 10 years . #% Mr President , I think the honourable Member will benefit immensely from seeing the highly readable documents which were considered for consultation by the Commission today . #% I suspect that if they did so it would do more for the European Union than all of its publicity budgets put together . #% We are prepared to take action and we call upon others to do so too . #% Indeed , a similar election plan for last October was disrupted by Nepalese police , undoubtedly in response to pressure from Beijing . #% Please help us to be efficient , Mr President . #% We must act on that issue . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for the commitment you have made during your term of office to trying to ensure a better situation for the suffering people of Burma . #% It now seems -- but it is by no means certain -- that , with a mere 11 weeks to go until 1 May , 13 Member States will take advantage of the facility to put obstacles in the way of free movement . #% In the UK , we have over 1.7 million micro-firms . #% Surely the Commissioner should be present to answer the questions which have been raised . #% That is a catch-all provision that is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis . #% Here we can assist through building civil society and use means such as our association agreement with Egypt to exert undoubted influence . #% These amendments also fit in with this Parliament 's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action . #% It is remarkable progress and I also welcome Commissioner Verheugen 's assurance that the Commission will take action if progress is not forthcoming in those 39 areas . #% Rightly or wrongly a number of Member State governments feel that it should be an individual national responsibility to deal with this issue , certainly in terms of the length of time that the displaced persons are provided for , rather than a Community function . #% We should not forget that micro-businesses of less than 10 employees actually make up over 90 % of all EU businesses . #% I am sure he was right that we should ask the Commission to examine the arguments and come back with a proposal within three years . #% The tax aspects of supplementary pensions need a broader approach in order to find suitable solutions to the existing problems and by avoiding additional and simultaneous double taxation for persons moving within the European Union . #% Nor can I honestly explain to them why the interests of the 80 % majority are so overlooked in EU policy . #% Although it remained unspoken , one of the main reasons for that was to avoid the whole procedure being dominated by Ecofin . #% Mr President , it is a pleasure to face the Commissioner for the fifth time today at this unearthly hour . #% Have any of the Member States examined , in particular , the issue of how pension funds themselves operate , given that they are , as Ms Jensen said , big financial players on the market ? #% If I can be slightly mischievous , one wonders just how much value for money Telef√≥nica will get out of Martin Bangemann . #% Clearly the major success has been carrying forward the Luxembourg conclusions on the enlargement process . #% That architecture consists in the establishment of a full financial control unit , as it were , in the office of every Commissioner . #% If this is true , this seems to be behaviour that is not consistent with the democratic process which this House would accept as the norm for a country which is shortly to become a Member State of the European Union . #% While I accept Mrs Lambert 's personal enthusiasm for this report and the fact that she proposed that it be drawn up , my criticism was of her Group 's attitude and that of the other Groups . #% I have to express amazement at the two speeches we have just heard , one from Mr Bushill-Matthews and the other from Mrs Villiers . #% The figure in the former 15 Member States is much lower , at 25 % . #% More seriously , the inspiration for the agency is the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which has no legal status pending the entry into force of the proposed European Constitution , something to which we are wholly opposed in principle . #% Whatever happens in this current crisis , we must not lose sight of the need for a political strategy , for a regional solution , after the crisis has been sorted out . #% We do not want quick fixes . #% This is particularly important where partners , not parents as it says in my explanatory statement for some very strange reason , are affected by a different legal status , and we have had a number of petitions on these issues which we added to our opinion . #% The Warsaw Convention is 70 years of age . #% The report therefore calls for an action plan with timing commitments against each major proposal , for such a plan to be endorsed by Parliament 's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in time for the spring 2003 European Council and for it then to be subject to annual monitoring through the Social Agenda scoreboard , as advocated by the Council . #% So this is not a moment when we can happily contemplate the intra-species recycling of animal protein or indeed anything which brings about a further degree of risk in our agricultural system . #% MS is the most common form of disability affecting young adults in the EU , and two-thirds of sufferers are women . #% This House must also look more closely in general at the human rights clauses in the EU Association Agreements in countries such as Syria , which continue to be one-party dictatorships . #% The world became used to the nuclear stand-off between the democratic west and the communist east during the Cold War , but in that confrontation , disaster was avoided because ultimately both sides were rational . #% How are we going to fund the new proposals in Pillar Two ? #% British Conservatives recognise the important role of the EU in promoting human rights and democracy in the world , as it is highlighted in the Coveney report . #% The one opportunity that is being neglected is tidal power . #% It needs to end and we need to bring about a proper balance between working and family life . #% That can only be helpful in working towards a goal in which there is eventually a single or merged European and Community patent system . #% Secondly , we have a lack of detail . #% Good legal advice , or knowledge , at the outset of a claim is essential if it is not to veer off in the wrong direction , causing aggravation , disappointment and denial of justice . #% The lessons of the failed Seattle Ministerial were that the WTO must become a fully democratic and transparent organisation which genuinely supports sustainable development and which effectively responds to the needs of developing countries . #% If you have an accident , a device within the vehicle will be triggered by the airbag going off , by a sudden rise in temperature in the car , by the car overturning or by sudden deceleration . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , for the Commission and Parliament here to seek to use a proposed trade agreement with Canada to influence that country 's internal affairs is simply wrong . #% 
Let us show that imagination and courage so that we can enlarge the European Union before the next European elections in 2004 . #% What are we to do in this new environment which will be upon us shortly ? #% Movement on the Brussels Convention is important , as has been said . #% We should have a country-of-origin approach underlying this directive . #% Mr Rothley has persuaded me personally but I know that there are many others in the House who still need to be persuaded . #% Mr President , applicant countries all have one thing in common : they are all very young democracies . #% According to the UNDP 's recent figures less than 10 % of global spending on health research addresses 90 % of the global disease burden . #% If we are not careful , we will take many chemicals off the market and this will reduce the amount of crops we can grow . #% Many of these installations are brand new and run according to the highest standards with typical German efficiency . #% However , the assertion that obstacles were put in the path of scientists is certainly not supported by the evidence that I heard and to suggest that nothing or too little was being done to eliminate the problem from our farms , is an insult to our farmers . #% So I say to Lithuanians and people across Europe : reject this dangerous step back to the past . #% Luckily , the newspaper has produced a series of revelations . #% First to ensure the traceability of beef , second to allow consumers to make a fully informed choice . #% Mr President , I should like to start my remarks by referring briefly to comments from the other side of the House , from Mr Medina Ortega , who complained about what this legislation does not do , with particular reference to social harmonisation and tax harmonisation - omissions which I personally welcome . #% Given that UK hauliers are already paying the highest fuel taxes in the world , these proposals would be the last straw for many in the UK road haulage industry . #% In conclusion , in a strange sort of way , I found this challenging and interesting experience quite fun at times . #% It is easily confused with `` Rapid Reaction Force '' ; it has been confused in the media and even in Parliament 's own session news this week . #% This was too open-ended for the Employment Committee and , therefore , we wanted to pin down that definition of sporadic and low intensity still further . #% As I understand it , in the questionnaires she refers to , that were sent back by the industry in the various Member States , there was a general feeling that , if anything , the 6/12 mile limit could be extended . #% So it is important , in my view , that the Cardiff summit sends out a number of clear messages . #% Tonight , the House has the opportunity to carry through an agreement at first reading , which will guarantee that support for consumers ' activities . #% However , I voted in favour of this report on a common immigration policy , but with an extremely heavy heart . #% My question is brief . #% We have seen that . #% Yesterday in committee , the Director-General of DG Development made it very clear that the position that you may have on the OCTs was not shared by the Commission . #% We do not sit around waiting for perfection . #% Let 's hope that President Klaus is the man to do that . #% The suggestion that to get tickets they have to give an address in France makes one seriously wonder who was awake when that proposal was going through . #% I first read about emissions trading and about harnessing market forces to encourage industry to meet environmental objectives a decade or so ago in pressure group magazines . #% I should also like to say that the fact that two Members of the European Parliament have now to leave the Labour Party in order to speak freely , one sitting with the Communists and one with the Greens - one who told me this morning that he was expelled by fax - suggests to me that the control-freak tendencies of the Labour Party are now becoming known to people in Europe as a whole . #% I would also urge the Commission and Member States to pursue a WTO binding commitment to allow all exports from least-developed countries duty-free access to European markets by 2003 . #% Three weeks ago I made a speech in this House calling for the 2006 budget to be rejected on the grounds that this Parliament has no business authorising further expenditure when we have the shame of a decade of dodgy unapproved accounts behind us . #% However , while we can wait to see what happens on the trade front , I do not think that disease and sickness waits for us at all . #% These adjustments are necessary because of the teething problems that we have discovered in operating the system . #% In 2004 , elections to the Greater London Authority are due to take place one month before the European elections . #% I now understand what Tony Blair means by Labour leading in Europe . #% Those are positives . #% The world was shocked by the fate of human beings , the suffering of survivors and the plight of orphans . #% I also recognise and appreciate the Commission 's efforts to persuade the Council to take this Treaty down the assent procedure route instead of , as it were , slipping it through on the nod . #% There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation . #% It suggests a compensation system there , which has been referred to earlier , because ` it is not as easy to increase labour productivity there ... ' - in public services - ' ... as in the private sector ' . #% My own region has turned itself around in the last 30 years . #% Rather we are supportive of the broad thrust of what we believe to be the liberalising effect of the text , which is absolutely overdue . #% The first is how the Commission handles the scientific advice available to it . #% Even on its own terms , the move to harmonisation is flawed . #% However , if we are to seek a better approach we must not let this opportunity to force greater scrutiny of animal tests to pass us by . #% We are , then , absolutely right to do all we can to press forward in the ways outlined in these two reports . #% This would duplicate the work of other bodies such as the United Nations , the OSCE or the Council of Europe . #% First , it is crucial that any decision to lift the embargo should not adversely affect stability across the Taiwan Straits . #% It should be setting a much better example . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this report . #% However , after my meeting I decided that , in Afghanistan , my western views on social and political rights for women would no doubt , in the eyes of the old mujaheddin guard , such as President Rabbani , classify me , too , as a revolutionary . #% The Buenos Aires Action Plan promises some progress by the time of COP VI in the year 2000 . #% We have fifteen days to stop the European Union - the Council , the Member States , this Parliament and the Commission - making itself look very silly . #% I recognise that at the moment they have very little option but to export military equipment . #% Quality , as we have been hearing , can be a problematic concept in education , especially when one looks at any form of assessment . #% Clearly what matters is internal price stability , and the external value of the euro is of much less significance . #% There is indeed a major demographic shift under way within the Union , and we must try to ensure that we retain older people in the labour market . #% It is most apt that we should have a resolution on Zimbabwe . #% It then , foolishly , rapidly went on to fight another conflict , first with Yemen over fishing grounds around the Hanish Islands , and then in 1998 , with Ethiopia again over disputed border territory . #% The date that has been chosen is the date that appears to gain the most support from a majority of Member States and of course , equally importantly , from the many other stakeholders involved . #% That is why we did not support either proposal and abstained . #% Mr President , why on earth does Turkey want to join the European Union in the first place ? #% I want to say at the outset , on behalf of my group , that we are supporting all the amendments that were tabled in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection . #% We agree that there should be adequate reporting back , not only on the environmental risks identified by the assessment , but on the action it is proposed to take to mitigate or remove them . #% The new area - that I am pleased we have introduced , and I would like to thank the Council for accepting this - is to encourage the development of clear quality standards related to disabled user provision . #% 
Mr President , buried deep in the committee opinions attached to the Sacconi report we find a slim contribution from the Committee on Budgets showing funding forecasts for the proposed European Chemicals Agency . #% I would like to see a substantial revision of the current proposals and a delay pending a much more inclusive process . #% I thank the Commissioner for a very comprehensive answer . #% The work that Parliament and its appointed mediator , Mrs Banotti , do in this area needs the serious encouragement of all Members , and I hope that the response we heard from the President-in-Office and that of the Commission point us in the right direction and that the powers-that-be will take this issue seriously for the benefit of our children . #% My question is about competition policy as well , and about coherence between competition policy and cohesion policy . #% We must remember that we are not talking about travel within the EU : we are talking about travel to the United States . #% Canada is , for instance , opposed to the EU 's GMO policies . #% The public is entitled to some joined-up thinking . #% Firstly , the agreement to bring in electronic stability control systems at the earliest possible date is a very major contribution to safety and I very much welcome that . #% Mr President , I would like to reiterate the thanks to the rapporteur for the extremely cooperative manner in which he has embarked upon this important report and I am pleased to participate in the intimate gathering of renewable fanatics so late at night . #% To the Commission I say : `` be firm '' . #% The EU Treaty right to freedom of movement and establishment also enjoys universal support , and yet is so clearly breached by Italy ' s 13th so-called transitional constitutional article , which exiles in perpetuity the male descendants of the House of Savoy from their own country . #% In the name of democracy and human rights the report calls for measures that , without care , would merely serve to empower essentially undemocratic elements , giving greater influence and visibility to fundamental Islamists and extremists who wish to unravel any attachment to western values . #% There is now no single independent media channel in Russia . #% The time has come for us to have that new interinstitutional agreement . #% It seems to me that these amendments are saying : do not trust viewers , do not trust TV producers , do not trust European companies and advertisers , but let us have controls , quotas , regulations . #% I am delighted that all but one of my amendments were accepted in committee , but I would like to point out that the text in recital K is not quite correct . #% It has not been recorded properly . #% It will not be very long before Member States bring forward their national energy efficiency action plans . #% Three hundred thousand internally displaced Karen people are on the run from the Burmese army . #% I would urge President Van Rompuy and President Barroso to reconsider the nature of the so-called exit strategy . #% That would simplify our votes greatly . #% BSE is a degenerative disease which does not cause sudden death anyway . #% This is a positive proposal which is in operation in some Member States already , including the United Kingdom and Sweden . #% The European Union , represented by the Commission on this occasion , has recently come to an agreement under which the human rights troika , in other words the dialogue between China and the European Union , will be resumed without conditions . #% The MMF Garriga Report seeks to increase funding from Member States for the period 2014-2020 by 5 % , and this I can not support at a time when extreme adversity is being experienced in the UK from the government 's dangerous and socially divisive austerity measures . #% I have met with representatives of both management and the workforce , including trade union representatives from GMB , and they are united in stating that jobs and livelihoods are at stake should the Commission impose anti-dumping duties on this particular sector . #% May I start by saying , Commissioner , that I was very pleased with what you had to say and I am as surprised to be saying that as perhaps you might be to hear me saying it . #% This should also help to reduce the level of error , improve control systems and increase assistance to sub-national authorities and beneficiaries . #% A huge proportion of fish processing plants in the United Kingdom have been forced to close and local fishing economies have been devastated . #% There was , and still is , concern among a lot of people that the change of business means that the Council will be absent on that important occasion . #% When it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good . #% There remains a greater need for donor resources and for national resources , and the Commission must continue to argue for more commitments to fight AIDS , to the programme and to the Global Health Fund from bilateral programmes . #% A good company will not treat its workforce or the community housing it as factors of production to be disposed of lightly in a global game of profit and loss . #% Therefore I call again on the Commission to use the precautionary principle consistently or admit that the whole thing is a politically motivated exercise with powerful commercial interests at play , undermining the precautionary principle and risking turning it into a farce . #% Technical assistance to facilitate the coordination of investigations is also needed if we are to track down these criminals across the Member States . #% We must never again allow political interference to dictate how we attack an outbreak . #% Once again , here is further proof that the UK and the other contributing Member States would be much better off outside the bureaucratic contraption that is the European Union . #% There have been times in our committee when we have been presented with initiatives from the Member States , where they want us to introduce penalties , but we find ourselves in a situation where we can not respond as they would like . #% The prize for us tonight is that for the first time in history we can achieve liberalisation of the international freight network . #% I voted ` no ' on the first vote and ` no ' on the second vote . #% As a member of the Committee on Transport , I have written to the chairman of that committee asking for early consideration of the implications for this important industry . #% I abstained on the final vote because although I agree with the principle behind this regulation , I can not agree to the inclusion of Annex 1 . #% As the ratification process on the Constitution gathers pace , it must be said that those ambitions clearly have not been realised . #% Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights , which is being discussed at the moment , to become enforceable in law . #% Parliament , at its first reading , was particularly concerned to add an important extra objective , namely to address the problem of diesel fuel spillage on the highway , which has been posing an increasing safety hazard for road users , particularly riders of motor cycles . #% I am not sure it has been entirely easy or pleasurable at all times . #% That is why I have tabled an amendment giving the Commission six weeks to give a full , authoritative and written answer to this House . #% They get inspected . #% He has outlined something of this , but not perhaps talked about that precise team . #% I was told by Mr Straw this afternoon that two options were being considered . #% I was also happy to hear the rapporteur insisting that products from third countries should meet the same food safety and quality standards as our own . #% The recommendation to create an observatory is one in fact that has been picked up in several EPP resolutions in recent months and I am therefore very surprised to see such a hostile resolution from that quarter here this week . #% The PKK does employ terrorist methods , and it has no doubt provoked and stirred up some of the recent violence , but its aims of achieving recognition of the cultural , linguistic and political identity of the Kurdish people are shared by many Kurds who do not espouse violence . #% It is particularly cunning since the future of fusion research , once the current phase of JET ends next year , is clouded in uncertainty . #% The third point which strikes me as arising from this report is the importance of a mandatory system to assess the proportionality of further legislative initiatives . #% We need to send a very clear message with this report , to make it absolutely clear that any use of space should be solely undertaken for peaceful purposes and in accordance with international law . #% However , that is something that must wait for another day . #% I naturally welcome the reference he just made in his reply to including security within the framework of the Lom√© Convention . #% Mr President , I must admit that it feels slightly surreal wanting to talk about other aspects of the Summit apart from Iraq , particularly given that some of the other things that the Summit dealt with are not exactly going to help us towards a more equal or a more peaceful world . #% I think we all share that . #% I invite colleagues to reject that proposal . #% We all know the picture . #% This resolution sets out the concerns that must be shared by the world-wide community about the deterioration of stability in Pakistan and in its neighbouring territories . #% There is tremendous scope for innovative and creative local high-quality production . #% Some of the issues have been more difficult than others . #% 
When we look at the criticisms of the payments side made in the statement of assurance , two or three things become very clear . #% The Prestige tanker was carrying high-sulphur heavy oil from Estonia to Singapore , but a lot of the rest is used in shipping , causing pollution at sea which we prevented on land . #% This also endangered the security of thousands of football fans . #% I hope the package we have agreed between us , with much assistance from the Finnish Presidency over recent months and of course with the guidance of Mr Sacconi , will firmly steer the industry towards substituting chemicals of high concern by safer alternatives and promote the development of such alternatives . #% High Representative Solana mentioned the Islamic Republic of Iran . #% For the present , what steps is the Commission taking to monitor the extension which has been granted since 1 July ? #% Nevertheless we are here now , and the Socialist Group supports the rapporteur ' s recommendation for adoption of this regulation with the minimum of amendments , already agreed in principle with the Council , in order to allow a fast-track , one-reading approval of the extension , and in reality to allow refugee support projects this year to go ahead rather than be cancelled . #% That is an unethical , immoral imbalance . #% The solution must be a ban on sales ; not just of virgin CFCs which is important and taken on board quite substantially by the European Commission and a number of European nations , but a total ban because of the problem of relabelling and lack of control . #% Equally , if we are talking about road safety , what is to stop the Portuguese and Italian Governments from improving road safety on their roads ? #% May I say that I speak with a background in the industry , though since joining this House I have of course severed all ties with it . #% The precedents are not encouraging . #% Nonetheless , what we need is to push towards total cumulation of rules of origin if we are really to maximize the economic potential of these overlapping agreements . #% For this reason , British Conservatives will not be supporting the joint motion . #% We must not shy away from addressing the difficult issues which surround Europe ' s single currency , because if we do so we will be letting down those people who elected us to this Chamber so recently . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , it is just under 100 years since all women were given the right to vote in the United Kingdom . #% Some drugs like beta interferon , which can help some MS sufferers , are not widely available . #% I support placing the budgetary line as a first step in the reserve to be released according to diplomatic progress . #% In particular , no European Union Member State should provide sanctuary for terrorists so they can mount attacks on another state . #% It is a very low threshold ; it is very easy to go back to a full normal procedure . #% Mr President , could I start my contribution by offering my congratulations to Commissioner Monti and his officials for the scrupulous and professional way in which they dealt with the proposed MCI Worldcom - Sprint merger . #% That right of public access to the documents of the institution is related to the democratic nature of those institutions . ' #% We should support this report , but this is only just the beginning of the process of working together with all the institutions to deliver what our citizens want , which is effective and efficient regulation or alternatives to regulation . #% What specific actions is Commissioner Byrne going to take to improve enforcement both of current laws and the laws that we hope to see implementing an eight-hour limit and an end to export subsidies ? #% It includes information on the wide range of activities implemented by the European Commission through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights . #% First , let me congratulate Mr Karim on his report on EU-India trade relations . #% Clearly the reform of the sugar sector is essential , but I can not agree that the collateral damage of what is an internal European Union reform should be felt by some of the small , vulnerable economies with whom we have very special relationships and partnerships . #% However , I have noticed a slight change of emphasis : you are all talking much more now about freedom , democracy , rights and values , as if it was the European Union that had invented these very things . #% It should not happen that way . #% Third , we should express our continuing concerns about China 's human rights record and any decision must be subject to its progress in meeting human rights standards . #% I agree that we need to build on the European Convention , we do not need to dismantle it and we do not need to ` nuance ' it so that it catches those that at the moment we are choosing not to support because , when we look at the history of certain of those terrorist groups , they have been supported in the past by certain of our governments . #% You will be aware that there is a strike on today and travelling is excessively difficult . #% The meeting convened on Thursday , 1 December , involving MEPs , certain committees and other EU institutions involved in the summit , specifically to discuss human rights concerns in Tunisia , further highlighted the importance of these issues . #% On hearing the news of Britain 's relief of Gibraltar and the victory over the French navy at Trincomalee , he wrote to his father , Leopold : ` Indeed , I have heard about England 's victories and I am greatly delighted too , for you know that I am out-and-out Englishman ' . #% As other speakers have highlighted in this afternoon 's debate , it seems to our Group that Iraq is the major issue for our budget in 2004 . #% It is essential that we meet and surpass the targets that we have set ourselves to combat such things as climate change . #% There was complete agreement that slaughter and containment was the most effective policy when this disease broke out . #% At the same time , we welcome the statement by the Pakistani Foreign Minister expressing sympathy with the victims and their families . #% Implementation of these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations . #% I particularly welcome the commitment to give real substance to the human rights clauses in our trade and partnership agreements with third countries - something we badly failed to do with Mexico . #% I emphasise this is an extension to existing rules and controls in this very , very delicate area . #% We have seen major problems in many markets around the world and of course our own economy has suffered as a consequence . #% Mr President , in order not to waste Parliament 's time , I handed in a change of vote in writing . #% But the bedrock principle of this proposal as amended , which I hope it will be by Parliament , will be to give consumers the power to compare prices quickly and easily , not to be misled by packaging and to assess the kind of value for money that they are receiving . #% The EU wishes to harmonise organic products and production , with more EU regulations and more EU snoopers . #% One was about structural change . #% Therefore , we strongly support the proposals Commissioner Fischler made in January because they are fully compatible with the Berlin Agreements and the roadmap for enlargement . #% The preamble to the Data Protection Convention and recitals to the Data Protection Directive also make clear that their purpose is to protect the fundamental right of privacy , not to restrict the information available to citizens about public activities . #% More disturbing is that , fearful of losing a vote or perhaps fearful of having a vote at all , you resort to a procedural device to prevent debate . #% These things are naturally anathema to socialists but are good for all our citizens . #% The assessments are carried out in conjunction with the Commission to ensure that the figures are within the financial perspective . #% Since so many of the EU 's goals can be partially realised by promoting sports , the EU must promote sport as a functional as well as recreational activity . #% I raised the item again , earlier this year ; that is a matter that to my knowledge has not yet been referred to any committee of this House although it was the decision of the House , as I say , in September of last year . #% Could you trust her or not ? #% It is important that we say here and now that the mere fact that we strongly approve of the principles of protecting data and that we want to move forward , and also the fact that this needs to be done quickly , does not absolve us from the job of scrutinising this proposal properly . #% We must make sure that Member States meet their targets for poverty reduction as outlined in the EU 2020 strategy . #% So what does Parliament expect from this ICAO meeting ? #% That was a mistake and it is a bad signal to send , not just to Members but to the wider public , who now know that , despite the force for that resolution , a small group of people denied them the right to be heard . #% It seems to me that if Member States wish to introduce some kind of book pricing regime into their own country , it is not for me to stand in their way . #% We in this House call for his immediate release , and we express regret , once again , that China goes to such extreme lengths against those who dare speak out for their basic human rights . #% We must take into account too the impact of the WTO , the IMF and the World Bank and the conditionalities which they impose upon developing countries and which actually make their trading possibilities more difficult . #% Political repression is as rife as it ever was in the Soviet days , and Lukashenko 's secret police - provocatively still called the KGB - are used as its enforcers . #% Mind you , Baroness Ludford 's speech suggests to me that there might be some form of political euthanasia which I would support . #% Over the last three decades , we have seen Black September , the IRA , the Red Brigades , ETA , Bader Meinhof , animal liberationists , bombs on the Paris Metro , American Embassy bombings in Africa , then the attacks in New York and Washington in 2001 , Madrid in March 2004 and , of course , in London in July this year . #% But lawmaking , especially at a European level , is a process -- a lengthy process -- not an end point . #% in writing . - This Parliament has played a key role in promoting equal treatment of people across the Union on grounds of sex , race , religion , belief , disability , age and sexual orientation . #% 
Strict rules in the past have caused unnecessary difficulties to slaughterhouses in the more remote areas of the EU , often because geographical restraints can lead to unfair competitive conditions which tend to favour larger enterprises . #% I wish to follow Mr Martin 's observation to the Presidency-in-Office , because the President-in-Office used the expression ` has brought no credit to the European Union ' , as if somehow the European Union is a different institution from our national institutions . #% Mr President , the dramatic events in C√¥te d'Ivoire have once again alerted us to the fragility of the situation in that country , which in the past was recognised as a great economic success in an otherwise very volatile region of Africa . #% Everyone is horrified by the consequences of the second Gulf War for the ordinary people of Iraq , with the recent estimate that there have been more than 650,000 deaths amongst the civilian population . #% However , in a recent case being considered by the Committee on Petitions , the anonymity of Mrs X , a former member of Lloyd 's , was breached , and as a direct result of that , Mrs X is being pursued by the British Government to the full extent of the law . #% It is just meant to be a comment , a statement of where it is . #% The latter dispute was only resolved in June 2000 after the loss of some 70 000 lives . #% In the UK at the moment , we have a ban on MRM from beef and also we do not have any animal going to the food chain over 30 months , but the problem is MRM beef coming in from other EU countries . #% And , if it is the absence of reliable statistics cited as the problem , urgent action for adequate definitions of the information should be called for . #% And the reason why , Ms McKenna , is that more people are dying - particularly in my country - from listeria and from infections that come from the mass production of foods , than are likely to die as a result of a building up of antibiotic resistance . #% Having said that , this report and the regulation acknowledge that certain state aids are acceptable and indeed desirable in relation to employment schemes . #% Since then the draft of a new comprehensive constitutional law on the protection of minorities has received a favourable opinion from the Council of Europe 's Venice Commission and work on the issue is continuing . #% These systems are produced in their millions , their leakability is notorious -- I know of colleagues at home who have had to have their air conditioning systems refilled two , three or four times . #% I just wonder whether you have remembered what happened to the last 10-year plan , which was launched in 2000 . #% I hope our fellow Members will recognise that . #% We can not afford to relax these conditions . #% Mr President , I wholeheartedly support this report which focuses its attention on the importance of local employment markets . #% This is an opportunity to blend tradition and the modern rediscovery of ancient skills . #% That demonstrates the problems that disabled people face and the real need for a disability directive . #% It seems to me that there is no procedure within Parliament , the Council , the Commission or whatever organization they are turning to that is able to offer them some help . #% Imagine the fiscal consequences for the businesses concerned , then imagine that these businesses are the mainstay of towns and villages with fragile economies , and think what the outcome would be for local shops , schools and other services . #% This report points the way in which policies should be developed . #% The road to rebuilding these lives is long and needs support . #% It invites employers to harness the time difference of three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half hours to pack in hours . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that although I have been allocated four minutes , I should like to do my bit for the simplification and streamlining of bureaucracy by speaking for less than half that time . #% Pontificating on instant solutions in advance of an inquiry will not be helpful . #% There is great concern about the alienation of some immigrant communities and their social and economic disadvantage . #% However , the directive is a further step in the EU 's attempts to extend its reach into the security and defence sphere . #% The Council had arrived at a sensible position on this and I have seen no evidence - and I have checked back with our own Food Standards Agency - that there are any legitimate concerns about content . #% As I understand it , within the first seven categories of research programmes , when health comes in , it is confined to highly scientific biomedical research programmes . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the ECR Group supported the Council 's original agreement on SWIFT with the United States and its terrorist-financed tracking programme for the transfer of financial messaging data , subject , of course , to certain safeguards . #% I would like to tackle money lending as well , but that is another issue . #% Only people with a bizarre outlook on life and a peculiar political perspective can downgrade the importance of aviation safety in the pursuit of their own nationalistic objectives . #% But , perhaps more importantly for our electorate , we must determine how to remain competitive in the global economy and how to ensure the internal security of our citizens . #% In the case of deep-sea fish , gestation periods are extremely long and thus any negative impacts on the habitats will have serious effects on stocks , both in the short and the long term . #% This would merely give comfort to extremists and sharpen the differences with the United States . #% We need to ensure that we do not indulge in needless harmonisation which endangers national security . #% A financial service , whether a savings vehicle like a pension or a mutual fund or just a simple bank account , is by its nature ethereal and intangible . #% We will also have three different Commissioners between May and November 2004 . #% It concerns the proposal to have a statement from the Commission on Thursday 6 November 2003 , entitled ` Ford workers laid off in Genk ' . #% If a British government were to refuse to implement these criminal offences , then it could be taken to the European Court of Justice , which would compel it to do so . #% They have failed ; UNHCR must now act accordingly . #% The Commission 's former chief accountant has drawn our attention to a number of concerns about the computer systems and how to ensure that our taxpayers ' money , our national governments ' money , is being spent correctly if the computer systems used do not support each other or provide proper figures . #% Only two EU members are nuclear-weapon states ( NWS ) , with an additional four participating in NATO nuclear weapons sharing . #% Why , and for how long ? #% The `` one size fits all '' monetary policy , as the Commission 's pessimistic 2001 economic report admits , can not be right for all of the countries all of the time and , coupled with the fiscal restraints of the Stability and Growth Pact , imposes severe destabilising problems and a lack of flexibility on certain economies , as we have already seen in the artificial boom scenario of Ireland . #% This Parliament has repeatedly called on the Member States to devote far greater urgency to addressing the auditors ' concerns , and in particular , we have called on the Member States to meet the terms of the 2006 interinstitutional agreement . #% Commissioner , I would be interested to know how the Commission is attempting to confront these issues in the long term . #% Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism . #% The Commission commented in its communication that neither the Commission nor the Council could accept the request by the European Parliament that information on the ferries and craft should be made publicly available . #% You say it has worked well , but I am afraid the recast ignores vital jurisprudence on what actually needs to be done . #% The high-tech small businesses which , in the end , are the target of the risk capital action plan , are in short supply themselves . #% This is a situation that has gone on for far too long . #% It is a clear problem that we need to address . #% If they do not have one , we will detain the ship until one is secured . #% People have mentioned the issue of the residence permit , where Member States may choose to make this available for particularly severe cases where complaints have been brought . #% The Treaty stresses liberty and respect for human rights as fundamental principles . #% It will be interesting to hear how you envisage your service developing in this direction . #% This is not a reflection on Latvia , just an example . #% The announcement in the United States this week has quite clearly demonstrated the speed at which research is now moving and the need to move technology and regulation on at the same pace . #% Therefore , this is a very important debate , and I am delighted that not just the Commissioner but the President-in-Office , Mr Duquesne , are here in person , recognising the importance of this issue . #% One is to remove the Commission from the line of fire of criticism , because you will have noticed that our resolution is somewhat critical of both the Commission and the Council . #% I would first like to stress that the ELDR Group defends the right of the Commission President to express himself personally on political issues concerning the future of the European Union . #% Even if it were applicable , I am not sure how much further forward it would take us . #% Firstly , a request addressed to the Commission . #% Buildings are key to cutting energy demand . #% 
We still have to decide how an EU of 25 or more can work , because failure to reform our decision-making process will guarantee that this enlargement is the breaking and not the making of the European Union . #% The Council of Opposition Parties has now been established , although one of the main opposition parties is not represented on it . #% It treats the new Member State citizens as second class , contrary to all the promises they were given , and it displays -- as on so many other issues such as Iraq , the Constitution and the budget -- a depressing lack of EU solidarity . #% But I will certainly look into the possibility of getting better information to all those involved . #% When I initially tabled my report I put forward a few controversial ideas just to see if anybody bothered to read what was going on . #% I hope that this matter will be looked at again by the Budgets Committee but I restate that all Mrs Gill had to do was take the recommendation of the Bureau not of this Quaestor and place it before this House for a vote . #% Will the Council try to ensure that the ECHO office visits as soon as possible ? #% In France we have also seen , all too unfortunately , human tragedy that has left in our minds the human aspect of all that is going on there . #% I would be very grateful for an answer to that question . #% After Doha that has changed . #% Their healthcare needs are proportionately greater and therefore need addressing with greater urgency . #% That is right and proper and I am very glad that we have reached this stage . #% In any case I say this to you , Mr Barroso , that in any sense of work planning I want to know what is already in progress . #% Even if there are reservations , that point is extremely important . #% Clearly , President Musharraf does not want a peaceful Kashmir election to be held . #% And if there is one tactical concern my group has about brandishing safeguard measures against those steel exports that might be diverted from the US to Europe , it is that it might actually alienate countries such as Russia , India and Brazil , with whom we have to act together in the WTO and the OECD to take on this American move . #% I should like to suggest that in future , when he makes one of his passing visits , we ask the Visitors ' Service to show him his seat ! #% That will not have strengthened our case . #% My concern now is that we must know the facts ahead of any action that the Commission and the Council might take in abandoning the tax-free policy . #% This is no time for bean counting , it is a time for clarity of intent and honesty of purpose . #% This deal ensures that there is no mandatory shelf registration and that there is no mandatory annual updating , unless the issuer intends to continue issuing shares or bonds . #% The only other matter I would like to raise is the issue of the need for a separate gender institute . #% If other countries were willing to emulate the strict standards enforced by the United Kingdom , an arms treaty would certainly be a worthwhile asset and a boon to international security . #% With new legislative proposals , we should not be pushed to provide opinions and reports at breakneck speed which allow us little time for thought and consultation with interest groups and citizens . #% If we are to recognise the primacy of the knowledge and information economy in the new global economy then we have to face the reality of looking at different priorities for our fundings . #% We have adopted a number of directives tending to decrease CO2 emissions , and the Commission has put forward a very useful programme showing what it has done and what it intends to do . #% We are not advocating second-guessing the scientific committee and our own Foods Standards Agency in the United Kingdom . #% The committee 's reasoning , as I understand it , was that , since the Council had not accepted my amendments , there was no point in going to conciliation as it would not have accepted them in future . #% In particular I would like to recognise Mr Herzog 's concerns , where he rightly points out in his amendments that we need to keep pace with technological change in order to reduce the possibility of criminality , of fraud and of money laundering . #% In that sense I agree with my colleagues that something has to happen sooner rather than later . #% If we were to receive that reply in advance of Friday , it would help the issue enormously . #% There are very serious issues at stake here . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to extend our congratulations to both the Council and the Commission for what seems to be a much improved preparation for this meeting , compared to the methodological confusion that seemed to reign prior to Seattle . #% It is very important that we should assist people making choices about purchasing equipment in knowing what the energy efficiency is . #% Parliament has gained the right to nominate two of the members of the administrative board . #% Just this week Thames Estuary Plastics of Rayleigh has had its interest subsidy from Europe confirmed to support twelve new jobs as part of a # 470 , 000 project . #% We hope that we will be able to block any heavy-handed attempt to deprive people of the products they know and continue to need . #% For the Party of European Socialists the essential issue here is human health rather than the possible effects on the meat market . #% I hope that the House will also limit the number of amendments that are adopted and not interfere too greatly with the common position . #% Secondly , Member States should be allowed to set excise duty rates themselves . #% I think it is appropriate that the European Parliament appreciates such a disparity and that we refrain from formalising the precise methods of collaboration and response to the operation of the subsidiarity mechanism at the present stage of affairs . #% Surely this is a case of blatant gender discrimination . #% Amendment No 77 deals with the practicalities ; the four-year procedure will be used only when Member States request it , and then it will depend upon them showing the necessary research on the product . #% However , it is our view that the Commission has produced a sensible proposal to combat their difficulties and that going beyond this , as the rapporteur proposes , is not justifiable in terms of policy or budgetary implications . #% I wish to thank sincerely all the shadow rapporteurs and other Members for their serious work and ultimately constructive approach to this regulation . #% He is still a household name across the world . #% Secondly , coming from Parliament 's rapporteur on corporate social responsibility , the Commissioner will not be surprised to be told that his commitment to simply promoting the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprise is wholly inadequate , in Parliament 's view , as the European Union 's contribution to developing global corporate accountability . #% There should be a cluster approach to ratification with the keener , more assured integrationists going first , rather than forming a nervous queue . #% It is obvious that there is work available in the European Union for people from third countries . #% Policing of fishing effort in European waters is woefully inadequate , and it is therefore hard to believe that things will be any different in foreign climes . #% In the absence of the Commission 's support now , I do not see how we , as legislators , not technical experts , can propose more ambitious targets for individual countries unless we pull figures out of the air , which seems to me a rather poor and amateurish way of making law . #% Why do we not extend the British Presidency for a further six months ? #% Answer that and this process will be successful . #% But finally we have seen the damage the CFP has done to the fishing stocks around our own coastlines . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I want to pay tribute to Mr Bendtsen who has worked extremely hard on this report and cooperated closely with the shadows from other parties . #% Madam President , as a long-time student of the enlargement question , I must confess to being slightly bemused by the debate going on about this particular round of enlargement . #% I am pleased that encouragement is now being given to re-use materials where environmentally appropriate , and I thank my colleagues across the House for the support they have given me in opposing the development of these so-called clever chips . #% Instead , we seek to micro-manage a highly technical and complex industrial development programme , a task for which we have neither the time nor the skills . #% At the time , we made the recommendations which this oral question refers to . #% Thank you Madam President . #% I congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on identifying some of the major issues which affect the success or otherwise of those markets at the moment , in particular his reference to counter-cyclical action with respect to the booms and busts that the world economy has seen over many years . #% I would like to take the opportunity to raise another issue about the global competitive environment in the car industry apart from regulation . #% I am thinking again of the role of ECHO . #% If not , I have a clear mandate to ask for this report to be referred back to committee , where it will be reformulated to reject the Commission 's strategy . #% My purpose in making this address , therefore , is to enter into the record my total disagreement with this directive . #% We do not want to jeopardise that scheme in any way and we now have enough assurances from the Commission that our concerns will be taken into account . #% 
It is about time the Court of Justice saw a little bit of sense in this and argued that money which is being handled corporately on behalf of the Member States should be considered a part of the European Union budget and be budgetized accordingly . #% Mr President , this is an important report on an important subject and I congratulate the rapporteur on her usual thoroughness and commitment . #% If Parliament endorses it , it proves that it too is living on another planet . #% Nevertheless , in taking on that case , Mr Duff managed to produce consensus by focusing on the procedures and not on the particular case , and he did this with considerable skill . #% Indeed , the size of Parliament , which is about to increase with Romania and Bulgaria joining , will actually decline in 2009 , back to 732 Members . #% That I regard as very helpful and a good sign for the future . #% Certainly it will have a partner in Parliament in attempting to rework the system radically . #% If that is the case , then how does this sit with DG Trade 's description of this as being the absolute role model ? #% But just general condemnation - while that has to be made - is really not sufficient . #% Madam President , I wish to join colleagues in welcoming this report and congratulating Mr Sakellariou . #% The very success of the reformist agenda seems to have provoked a backlash by the conservative reactionary forces and an attempt to punish the majority who voted in February for reform . #% This is illustrated by the Guant√°namo Bay situation . #% Where such measures are in place , in seems unnecessary to impose the more technical requirement of the date-based export scheme and the certified animal scheme to the domestic market ; hence , Amendment No 53 . #% Around the table there were also four cabinet ministers , twelve chief executives of energy producers and energy users , three NGOs , the Chairman of the European Trade Union Congress and three regulators . #% Such exploitation of fellow human beings must be unacceptable as we near the new millennium . #% This will enable the 78 % of East Timorese who voted on 30 August to establish their own independent sovereign state and to look forward to a peaceful and prosperous future within their own homeland . #% The idea of having the Commissioners here is to question them directly on specific issues , and not all Members have done that . #% For instance , some enlightened hotels allocate hotel rooms near lifts to avoid single women having to walk along unfamiliar corridors where they may be subject to uninvited approaches - a very wise idea which perhaps we ought to replicate elsewhere . #% Finally , a word on China . #% Europe understands only too well how the tools of democracy can be seized by dictators to undermine democracy itself . #% As regards the budget point , we had different views . #% We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward . #% Amendment No 9 is discriminatory , in my view , on grounds of religion . #% If they want to raise an issue , let us be held accountable and let us give our view on whatever we think . #% For that reason , it would be wrong to place more unnecessary burdens and regulations upon food supplements and the health-food shops that sell them . #% We should be proud of this achievement and support it . #% Such talk will ring exceedingly hollow if this Parliament does not first do all it can to address existing Treaty violations . #% However , the globalization of our economies is an inevitable development and we in this Parliament must surely support an agreement which will help to stimulate trade between Mexico and Europe to our mutual benefit and help tilt the balance against Mexico becoming even more dependent on the United States . #% Otherwise , the United States and the Far East will get that competitive advantage and once again Europe will have lost out . #% Whilst it is right and proper that a legislative body such as the European Union should be bound by minimum standards of what is acceptable in civilised society , nothing will be gained if the implementation of the Charter continues to develop along the lines set out in this report . #% Madam President , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy proposed a number of amendments to the budget . #% in writing . - The relative success of Operation Atalanta , now renewed for a year , underlines the fact that although the European Security and Defence Policy has the potential to achieve significant results for Member States , it is still unclear why NATO alone could not match this and thus avoid duplication . #% There is no justification whatsoever for a ban on barometers . #% All the indications are that he was murdered by Agathon Rwasa 's rebel FLN . #% This report represents words ; we must now see action . #% What is the use of a code of conduct on arms exports , or an arms embargo , if we do not condemn those who violate them ? #% Self-evidently , living survivors are predominantly elderly , and many are infirm or living their remaining years in poverty . #% Alongside that , I wonder if I might invite him , given that yesterday this Parliament finally received formally the package for the reform of the Staff Regulations , to say what his expectations are in terms of our scrutiny of this very important package given that it is of course tied in with a number of important considerations , such as the pay package , ` le m√©thode ' , and what he would like to see the Parliament do in terms of timing and other work on this important package . #% That means we have to look at the quality of the economic growth we seek and not just the amount . #% The effects will reach into a wide-range of industries - not only agriculture , but road haulage , construction and many other areas . #% Under Rule 60 I am required later this morning , as chairman of the relevant committee , to recommend to this House whether or not we refer back . #% The EPP , it seems , do not accept that ethnic minorities feel alienated from the electoral process . #% In the meantime , my group calls for maximum restraint by the security forces and for the arrest and trial of the ancien regime 's presidential guard leadership responsible for the shooting , in the last few days , of innocent bystanders , in a futile attempt to destabilise the country . #% Institutional shareholdings by fund managers who sought to repatriate rights to owners of those shares was critical to the success and balance of this report . #% Ukraine has now courageously sorted itself out and started out on an independent path -- as has Georgia -- and Russia , unsurprisingly , is not happy with this . #% The whole deletion of this article on data retention which is now being called for was never , ever called for in committee . #% The Commissioner has been kind enough to say that plans for amendment to the transit system are under way . #% There is , however , a delicacy trade , which is for the consumption of bushmeat outside Africa . #% As soon as the opinion has been received the matter will be addressed . #% In 1999 , Mr Hamma Hammami and three other leaders of the Tunisian Communist Party were convicted in absentia for dissident activity . #% Experience shows that they issued ` locked in ' contracts and are guilty of overcharging for their services . #% I have also felt , ever since Nice and Article 191 , that this idea that you qualify if you conform to the democratic principles of the Union is potentially a dangerous one . #% If you wish to serve the modern and future worlds , see that universities are funded properly , encourage those students who wish to study abroad , then simply leave them all alone to get on with it . #% If they do , then their status needs to be defined . #% The 1998 employment guidelines are important here because they give a very important impetus to the objective of reconciling work and family life which should benefit all parents . #% The new waste management strategy recognizes the role of local and regional authorities in facilitating , developing and implementing a real waste management strategy for Europe . #% This is also a very timely debate . #% My second point concerns an area in which the European Union actually has been spending money , and needs to continue to do so without counting the cost too closely . #% I believe it is against the European Convention on Human Rights . #% Mr President , the issues discussed at Tampere are obviously of great concern to all decent law-abiding people : asylum , immigration , cross-border crime and not least the death-dealing drug-smuggling activities of the loathsome drug barons . #% The point made by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte about social exclusion is particularly valid . #% Regrettably , the People 's Republic of China has used every available means to block this . #% ESDP is a serious deviation from this concept . #% That would not indicate wise judgment , but abject cowardice demonstrating a total want of real leadership . #% Military airspace and its abuse in some countries is something that we also have to address not just in terms of the space that is taken up by military aircraft , but also on occasions the abuse of the civil air corridors by military aircraft not abiding by civil air procedures . #% Mr President , we were all trying to address the same issue concerning the mention of Kashmir . #% 
Mr President , I understand why Commissioner Verheugen feels cheated on the 1999 deal that the Greek Cypriot Government would facilitate a settlement if accession were unconditional . #% The European Central Bank replied to the report , but its replies were certainly short , I would say ` terse ' , and the Court of Auditors found them quite inadequate since they did not give any indications of actions that the ECB intended to take to remedy the shortcomings exposed by the Court of Auditors ' report . #% But Europe and its peoples do demand that we subject the ECB to legitimate , democratic accountability , that we verify that what is done in the name of the independent bank , is done for the people , of the people and is by the people ; that the central objective of price stability leads to the palace of prosperity and jobs , not to the den of deflation and recession . #% That might be at the root of the kind of perception they have . #% However , I agree with his government when it says that this directive has been watered down too much already . #% Some may question why I , as a British Member , should like to speak on this issue . #% It is vitally important that we keep track of the various Member States and their record on state aid . #% As honourable Members will see from the document , which will be available to them today , the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission , with this Parliament and with the Council , which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January , have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements . #% I hope the Commission will allow me to draw attention also to paragraph 44 about the dangers of passive smoking , although it might be a surprise for this to appear in this particular report . #% I want to thank and pay tribute to Fokion Fotiadis and to Jonathan Scheele , who succeeded him at the Commission delegation in Bucharest , to Mr Rehn himself and to Mr Verheugen , his predecessor . #% Was it some secretary ? #% Here there are three elements I would like to contribute . #% Mr President , I would also like to join in the congratulations to Mr D√©sir , the rapporteur . #% If our aim is to help when farming income drops , it will not help if the payment is delayed until after the farmers have gone bankrupt . #% When we talk about change we must remember that enlargement has to be ratified by every single parliament in the European Union and by this parliament . #% I believe that the revision the Commission placed before Parliament , on which we subsequently voted in committee and the first reading of which was deferred in March of this year , did not go far enough , and I know we have a difference of opinion on this . #% However , this is the first step on a very long road for a country facing enormous difficulties in terms of lack of communications and lack of infrastructure . #% I am sure the whole House , even at this late hour , would join with me in wishing Dagmar well , and believing that she will recover with her customary vigour in the very near future . #% There are many committees in this Parliament , which do not have representation from every Member State . #% Our credibility is at stake here and I welcome the opportunity offered to us by the Commission to define a very clear and shared vision of Europe 's role in the democratic process in countries all over the world . #% The document states that , due to the institutional changeover in 2004 , a lighter procedure than usual was adopted for the European Parliament to consider the policy strategy . #% Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to speak about one part of this report , namely the issue of homelessness . #% The children themselves will , in most instances , achieve better at school , they will get better grades , they will have high employment levels and better employment and their family relationships will be better - as will their health . #% It must be based on the natural abilities of the individual athlete or team , and never on performance enhanced by pharmaceutical or technical aids . #% We have often criticised him here in this Chamber , but we could have congratulated him this morning for eventually taking the initiative to bring forward this proposal on needle-stick injuries , sharps injuries . #% This will only apply to complex processed foods such as ready-to-eat meals , breakfast cereals and all of those convenience foods produced on an industrial scale whose nutritional content - which is often poor - consumers are often unaware of or misinformed about . #% They are supporting a bill that would impose the death penalty , or life imprisonment , on homosexuals , depending on the nature of their so-called crime . #% I would like to ask him if he has any indication yet as to the precise negotiations for the mandate from the South African side ? #% Stephen Hughes accused me of regarding Safety issues as a trivial matter : I have never said this nor thought this . #% Has he consulted Finnish , Danish , British or French shipbuilders to see what the implications of this deal will be ? #% One final point : quite rightly , Mr Dell ` Alba did not make a strong point of the proposition that in reality the present interpretation is ignored . #% This is good for business , it is good for consumers and we should welcome it . #% author . - Mr President , I would say this to the Commissioner : since the start of the economic downturn , the Commission has repeatedly promised not to turn to protectionist policies but to embrace liberalisation - which you yourself have been very much in favour of - create opportunities for European businesses and make a more attractive opportunity in Europe for investment . #% Rural areas need economic aid as well as houses for holiday-makers and relatively rich retired people . #% The Commission must be as efficient as it is requiring our businesses and citizens to be . #% The objective is to ensure compliance with the Treaty and , in particular , the single market . #% I welcome the reference in the conclusions of Thessaloniki to the participation of Parliament in the IGC . #% A new report on the evaluation of aspartame would lead simply to negative publicity . #% It is not an attempt to create a power of censorship over questions . #% I want to pick up on certain aspects where , for once - unlike last year 's Spring Summit - we looked at issues relating to global equity to some extent . #% I am here also because I do actually represent one of those big cities that the previous speaker mentioned . #% This is an important process . #% That will be the focus of the 1999 guidelines : to give mainstreaming a real chance by utilising the European employment strategy to the full , making the funds more receptive to that concept and using the Treaty support . #% This brings me to a point that Mr Van Hecke raised : first of all we must try to ensure that rules of origin take into account second-stage products , which help countries to industrialise , and particularly ones such as cotton . #% It is most important that we do nothing to undermine that confidence and the duty to the people of Bulgaria that we share with the Bulgarian authorities . #% Who do I appeal to or where do I get compensation from ? #% Governments in search of populist headlines about the number of applications rejected from so-called bogus asylum seekers should tell the truth . #% May I draw your attention to comments that he has made since the date that you mention and ask you to what extent the Presidency is committed to doing away with certain provisions of the Convention on Human Rights ? #% Finally , if we get it right for the textile industry , we can learn some very important lessons for other industrial sectors . #% I will therefore be pursuing this with President Borrell and asking him to take it up with the Spanish Government . #% If this legislation is adopted , and if some countries are reluctant to lift their moratorium on genetically modified foods , what action will it take ? #% He called for a global ban on so-called ` naked body scanners ' . #% The idea of a non-binding convention , to which other speakers have referred , is an idea whose time has now come . #% I appreciate that you are not the President of Parliament , who has always proved partial . #% I appreciate that these are challenging times for the textile industry . #% We have a clear timetable . #% Although no expert , I would certainly support the calls for all prisoners of conscience to be freed , in Syria and elsewhere . #% The checks and balances now being written into the regulations are , I believe , going to lead to a number of challenges , and I welcome the Commission 's commitment to look at this after it is included . #% It is unfair that our growers , who tend to produce more than 300 tonnes per year , should be punished for their efficiency by receiving only 50 % compensation . #% Missed off at the beginning of the amendment were the words `` whereas Plan Colombia is not the process of dialogue amongst the various social partners and ... '' and then the rest remains . #% But we must make a special effort to keep up a dialogue with Muslims and include them in European societies . #% Mr President , we are in the presence of the old hands today -- that group of Members who have tried to deal with the questions of food safety and hygiene in cooperation with the Commissioner throughout this parliamentary term . #% The amendment seeks to add a new paragraph 1a to the legislative resolution , which reads : ` Requests that the concerns regarding the recognition of third country flags within the scope of this agreement be evaluated in subsequent renewals . ' #% For our part we have to realise that we must have greater military capability in order to back up our actions . #% Mr Mayer , in an excellent report , wisely says at the conclusion that he advocates launching the European statute on a maiden voyage . #% I speak as the coordinator of the ELDR Group on the Legal Affairs Committee . #% 
We hope that he can deliver . #% It was news to the Belgian members of my committee that this proposal would cost them EUR 1 000 million a year . #% What can we do to remedy the situation if one or the other manufacturer does not respect the deal ? #% The fact that I could say that on this issue we were speaking as one and it was a cross-party alliance hopefully helped to reinforce the overall message and the will of Parliament . #% I know Mr Titley has already paid tribute to the endeavours of Commissioner Kinnock to ensure coaches are as safe as they possibly can be . #% Mao 's legacy of murder , oppression , suffering , misery , starvation and death is in a league of its own . #% This seems likes a large amount , but I would merely point out that there are a number of quoted companies currently meeting the small and medium-sized enterprise definition that would actually be covered by this . #% There can be no question of admitting countries unable or unwilling to take effective action to combat crime or the traffic of people and drugs . #% I very much welcome the Commissioner 's responses , but can I also ask whether he would agree that more flexibility , particularly within the review of the working time directive , would be good for employment as well as competitiveness , and would he give a personal lead in promoting this ? #% I would also like to commend the European MS Platform for their campaigning work . #% However , this issue of tissues and cells and how we deal with it has raised an interesting question about subsidiarity . #% A law passed on 12 August 2005 making provision for the statute of magistrates does not take into consideration earlier calls by the Tunisian Magistrates ' Association concerning terms and conditions of service and would appear to weaken its position . #% Amendment 7 also underlines the need for the promotion of the harmonisation of statistics on work-related accidents and illnesses , a crucial point . #% Today 's vote and report brings that aim one step closer . #% What are your comments on that suggestion , and could you convey that idea to the President ? #% The ECJ insisted that the documents were presented . #% We do not want a quick , ill-conceived reaction to events that have taken place in my country and the announcement made by the British Government . #% It has been a lengthy process and he has made a tremendous amount of progress . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Green Group I would like to welcome both of these reports . #% Cathy Ashton was an active member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament . #% I call on those involved in the conciliation to stick resolutely by Parliament 's amendments , so that we can ensure that the safety of our docks and the jobs of our dockworkers are put first . #% We have to look at new ways : people-to-people links , education establishments , diplomats , politicians and trade negotiators working more closely to try to make the Congress understand that this relationship between Europe and the United States is so important for our mutual future . #% I recognize the tremendous difficulties we have got ourselves into with the agenda . #% Nowhere is this contempt for democracy better illustrated than by the actions of the Austrian Presidency . #% However , we in the United Kingdom are right to bring in measures to prevent benefit tourism , whilst at the same time welcoming those seeking to work in our country . #% So , allow this UK representative to bring to the table today some UK experience and practice : that less regulation equals more employment . #% I wish to see harmonised environmental taxation at a European level - the objective being not to raise more money but to change practices and priorities and ensure that industry at the same time is able to compete on a level playing field . #% Whilst there are certain omissions which are regrettable , on the whole we support the Commission 's programme . #% We must make sure that we mainstream disabled people ; that all legislation takes account of the specific needs of disabled people , whether they are wheelchair users , someone with a visual impairment , someone with a hearing impairment , someone with a learning difficulty , or someone with a mental health problem . #% Think how many people are working in large companies , not using all their skills , trapped in large organisations , worried about moving because they can not take their pensions with them , concerned not least about unemployment . #% It takes a firm line on human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir . #% First of all , I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly , but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control . #% With regard to Mr Bossi 's cases , I will approach them separately with reference to the name of the court from which they have been referred . #% So far we have heard nothing this afternoon about the people who are driving the economy forward because they are getting open access to tenders , cheaply and readily available by electronic means . #% It is better to proceed with a combination of setting higher standards and offering fiscal incentives , coupled with a campaign to persuade people to change . #% I know it is very late but I believe that is the directive we are discussing , otherwise I am in the wrong room . #% We do not want to resile from those challenging targets , but to give them that stability . #% But not all is bleak . #% . Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his kind words and all the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who worked exceptionally hard on this . #% Today technology has moved on and people all over the planet can watch what they like , where they like . #% When I spin round on my desk chair to access my email I am entangled in a mess of wires . #% If it does know then a mere simpleton like me would love to know what it means by that . #% Unfortunately I have to leave now to go back for personal reasons . #% The proposal in its current form will reduce flexibility , reduce opportunities for temporary workers and lead to more bureaucracy . #% This is not just a matter of the availability of suitable international forces but , as Commission Patten has said , it also tests the willingness of reluctant local warlords , often backed by foreign interests in the region , to comply with the authority of Kabul . #% The amendments that we have constructively negotiated with the Commission and Council improve this proposal : the recognition that we need additional money , the fact that this is simply a first payment and the request to the Commission both to bring forward a legal base for future contributions and to provide a report so that some of these information issues can be dealt with . #% It is exacerbated when humanitarian aid undermines local farmers and local economies . #% I would have thought that under Title VI of the EU Treaty - police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters - the Council could at least coordinate and give a fuller answer . #% I sincerely wish President Karzai and ex-king Mohammad Zahir Shah well with all the challenging problems that they face in the months to come . #% They exploit loopholes that the EU allows , and we continue to allow that and enable a few rich people to exploit the system , making a mockery of our EU regulations . #% If they choose to go into a career , they must be supported to do so on an equal playing field . #% Mr President , I very much support the joint resolution which my group has signed up to in relation to the Summit and the Social Forum . #% These were passengers who had booked online through their own accounts , a practice that has been increasing over many years . #% That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole . #% There has been a lot of talk in this debate about the legal and administrative obstacles to local employment in the Member States . #% We were told that in a single currency , Member States would no longer be able to devalue their way out of trouble , and would instead have to reform their economies to make them more competitive . #% There are countries benefiting from trading arrangements from the Lom√© convention with governments which are actually quite a long way from the kind of parliamentary democracy that we understand in Europe . #% Eighty short-term observers from the EU and eighty-five bilaterally from Member States will be deployed throughout the whole of Cambodia . #% The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague , Mrs Schreyer , who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening . #% That is to be warmly supported and it is worth noting that it has been supported by countries of the Commonwealth as well as the United States , in addition to Member States of the European Union . #% The CAP with its export subsidies and import protection is a gross barrier to trade justice . #% Would it be a framework regulation or legislative decision of some kind ? #% My group commends her approach and will support the bulk of the amendments which have been tabled in the Committee on the Environment . #% We need to get order in our asylum systems with a common EU system that does not shift responsibility but shares it . #% As I said earlier , this report does not aim to take decisions , but to enable the new Parliament to do so while also , along with the new Commission and the Council , to at least take note of what we are saying . #% Mr President , I just wanted to ask whether we were going to benefit from the presence of the presidency of the Council this afternoon , because the remarks that I want to make -- and which I am sure many of my colleagues will be making -- are in fact directed at the Council . #% 
In an era where many citizens , from all sections of society , feel disenfranchised and marginalised , the call for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment is certainly needed . #% This communication from the Commission takes the issue forward within the energy sector . #% The size , unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies . #% The report also welcomes benchmarking , but it takes the view that a successful benchmarking approach will need not just more comparable and reliable data but also a harmonised system of definitions , recording and reporting of occupational injuries and diseases . #% We need to ask the Commission , in taking this forward , to look at building a network of excellence around these technologies . #% Mr President , Mr Straw proudly told us that we have had 48 ministerial speeches during the British Presidency but I have to say that we have very little to show for any of them . #% It gripped us deeply . #% This case of the Qatif gang-raped woman sentenced to 200 lashings has horrified the world . #% Again this afternoon we have heard several speakers who really are not particularly in favour of good relations between the European Parliament and the US Administration . #% This is hardly the moment for the Commission to be encouraged to embark on yet another ambitious development of its role . #% Mr President , on behalf of my party , may I offer my deepest condolences to the people of the United States . #% That is what we are talking about : property in its widest sense . #% Nonetheless , there has been a lot of bullying going on . #% I support this refinancing package , but it must not be at the expense of British workers and British jobs . #% The EU is also concerned by reports from NGOs , including Amnesty International , about prison conditions in Tunisia . #% And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning . #% The most important thing about my report is that I rejected the idea - and the Committee has backed me on this - that it should be a recommendation . #% Ensuring fundamental human rights is the best of intentions , but a charter for litigation and bureaucracy is surely another road to another hell . #% The very functioning of an enlarged European Union will depend on the answers brought to the questions raised in this report . #% There is a general assumption that we want to maintain and improve relationships at all levels in the United States - the administration and the Congress . #% It must have been clear to the judge , by 16 November at the latest , that there was no evidence against many of the individuals and they should therefore have been released immediately . #% Whilst in theory the Vietnamese Constitution provides for freedom of religious belief , the country 's courts rarely interpret the laws to protect a person 's right to religious freedom . #% One lady summed it up when she said ` they have taken away our dreams ' . #% One is in transparency , as other Members have said . #% However , for some people all roads always lead to the standard socialist solution of more money , more people and more regulation . #% So I would like to finish on a personal note , by expressing my appreciation of the valuable work done by members of the Fisheries Committee throughout and by thanking Commissioner Borg and his team for all that has been achieved in their five years at the helm . #% It is in Europe 's interest and the whole world 's interest that China shows the world what must be done in these circumstances . #% In addition , we want to put on record what we believe are misrepresentations in some of the text . #% The immediate priority , of course , is to resettle those thousands of Tamil civilians caught up in the conflict and now being held in poor conditions in camps . #% Perhaps the Constitution and the referendums that we are going to have offer us both a chance for a solution ; but they must be free and fair referendums . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Madam President , the announcement of the democratic opening last year gave hope of a genuine breakthrough in securing respect for Kurdish linguistic , cultural and human rights in Turkey and closing the door on the years of terrorism and violence . #% Every speech that I have sat through this morning has been extended one way or another through your incompetence in the chair . #% That is what it is all about , Mr Barroso ! #% We also call on the Chechen authorities to prevent such incursions being launched from their territory . #% I urge the Commission to accept our demand for a revision of that regulation , especially in respect of the new Constitution . #% Rejecting Nice would have caused delay and confusion . #% Commissioner Kinnock 's proposals give us the tools to achieve that target . #% I just qualify as being under 55 - I am not quite sure whether that also applies to the Committee on Agriculture . #% I want us to consider the interests of those we are really trying to protect with this directive , namely the minority shareholders , so that we can begin to secure investment and ownership in enterprises across Europe . #% However , he soon found out , perhaps counter-intuitively , that private schools could provide a better education to the poor . #% Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar spoke of the deep-rooted challenges we face . #% The British Conservatives deplore violence of any kind and welcome measures to combat this , including some of the initiatives under the Daphne programme . #% I never knew , for instance , that something called the Protermo method could produce as much heat and fury as it did in the debate in our committee . #% It means that the social and economic fabric around the ports declines , while the EU claims to be combating this particular misery . #% We feel this should be done independently . #% However , we oppose the minor references to the Treaty of Lisbon . #% However , we have grave reservations about proposals to fund it through the existing European budget . #% That will mean less money for Iran to build its nuclear weapons . #% British farmers , normally a very phlegmatic , law-abiding group of people , are far less prone to demonstrate than their opposite numbers in some other countries . #% What does the rapporteur know that we do not ? #% It is sad that the opposition parties in Bangladesh are opposing this because it offers the only real hope of bringing this terrible conflict to an end . #% Can I ask our own President please to ensure that at the next Strasbourg session we get not only a proper explanation , but also an apology ? #% There is concern that they are not being properly supported or identified . #% Yet here we are , with yet another centralised attempt to set the world to rights . #% That is why I am working in the campaign to give the red card to forced prostitution and I hope all the fans , footballers and sports associations , together with all other organisations , will get behind the campaign to stamp out this evil trade . #% That is why reform is essential . #% That is going on . #% Although cross-border healthcare affects only a small percentage of EU citizens , clarifying the existing rights of these patients in this single piece of legislation will ensure that citizens wishing to travel to another Member State for medical treatment are financially protected . #% If that point needed stressing , the signing of an agreement by Alicante - the trademarks agency - with the Spanish Government for a ECU 24 million building without proper control or consultation with Parliament 's Budget Committee underlines this question . #% What we would like to see are proposals for dealing with economy of legislation as well as simplicity . #% He runs away from the debate and he runs away from the reality . #% Mr Karadzic 's book is called . #% What we need to do now is concentrate on establishing a framework for the progressive lifting of the main ban . #% This includes the closure of plants 3 and 4 of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Station before the end of 2006 . #% Mr President , I would make it clear from the beginning that the Socialist Group is in favour of the Commission 's communication about building a comprehensive partnership with China . #% She has the example , in the three governates of northern Iraq , of democracy and the Rule of Law . #% 
I congratulate the German presidency on the firmness of its resolve and leadership in this conflict . #% author . - I thank the Commissioner , and agree with her that the election observations are some of the most useful work that the European Union does . #% Mr President , I , like Mrs Barsi-Pataky , am also particularly concerned about the issue of timing . #% Firstly , there was the NGO forum . #% Similarly , decisions that will destroy thousands of livelihoods in banana-dependent countries -- our traditional suppliers -- were also taken last week . #% You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting . #% There is no evidence that self-employed lorry drivers , who rely on their own health and , on the safety of their vehicles for their day-to-day business existence , are in need of more EU legislation to make them more safe . #% As leisure boaters ' red diesel usage makes up less than 0.05 % of the country 's diesel consumption , the environmental benefits are essentially negligible . #% This is no way to organise business . #% I do not want to see a delay to the implementation of these proposals over relatively minor issues . #% I was on a flight from London to Paris with 28 other passengers , including Mrs Lynne and Baroness Nicholson . #% However , thanks to the intervention of Mr Schwab , if the Commission believes that there could be an earlier date , that is provided for in the comitology procedure . #% We have listened to the concerns of people calling for the right to make an informed choice about GM food and we are trying to put in place a labelling and information scheme which makes that choice a reality . #% If I could join with other colleagues from the United Kingdom to thank you for your efforts over the last six months and also say that , in connection with the Constitution , we were delighted that there were two ` no ' votes in Holland and France and we will not -- unexpectedly to you -- be demanding a referendum in the United Kingdom if any part of the Constitution is proposed for bringing forward in future . #% There is one point of confusion which I wish to clear up . #% We want the European Parliament to be given the power to dismiss individual Commissioners for maladministration or fraud . #% Madam President , this issue divides our Member States as it does people across the world , sometimes with an intensity comparable to religious conviction . #% We need to remember as well the context of the report released by the European Space Agency in December 2000 in which the so-called Three Wise Men looked into the future of ESA and concluded and I quote : `` Embarking on development of a European defence system , including a space component , will provide a significant part of European public investment . '' #% I fear that our exchange in the Chamber now creates the need for legislation to stop lazy companies from letting private data fall into the wrong hands . #% We request technical assistance in the implementation of new schemes , especially with regard to self-policing . #% I applaud Mrs Peijs ' work in reconciling what looked fairly irreconcilable and coming up with a solution that favours home State control which is preferable in terms of the internal market , but I have some anxiety that there will still have to be some fine-tuning . #% The Commission so far is seeking to remain silent about that period , a period when the assets of the petitioners were being seized and some were being made bankrupt , when policy-holders were at risk if the reserves were not there and when other insurance undertakings across Europe were having to comply with the directive , a period when the English courts in various rulings said that Lloyd 's did not have a system in place for making proper reserves . #% The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year ? #% I am not going to go over what Mr Cassidy said because he explained it so lucidly . #% The import dependence of the EU Member States and the related increasing dependence on natural gas is hardly a secret . #% I look forward to it . #% Mr Corrie 's mention of the recent seizure in Amsterdam of 2 000 monkey noses indicates all too well the extent of the trade and the suffering and devastation occasioned to these animals . #% Could you please refer this question to the Conference of Presidents so that some system can be found to deal with very urgent and important matters such as this one ? #% This directive concerns the action which Member States should take locally to deal with the particular problem of ozone . #% Mr President , I am sorry that it is Commissioner Kinnock who has to be here this afternoon to take this criticism on the chin , because I in no way regard him as personally responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves . #% Madam President , may I firstly say that I do not blame you personally , but many colleagues have not been able to speak in the debate because they have left the Chamber while we wait for another Commissioner . #% The Commission seems to be heading the other way , towards a freer structure . #% I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention , which is about the role of agencies . #% The most effective lobby groups do their job , which is not to represent society at large - that is this elected Parliament 's duty - but to represent their own vested interest . #% Although some sceptics still doubt the phenomenon of global warming , nobody can doubt the cooling of relations between the EU and the US over its refusal to recommend ratification of the Kyoto Protocol . #% Mr President , there are two important issues to make here particularly for the people on the benches opposite , because there is an allegation that this is a partisan report . #% Having received a massive package of debt refinancing from the EU to prevent its euro-based economy from collapse , Greece is hardly now in a position to hold hostage the whole enlargement process with its neighbour . #% We must restore public confidence in aviation and the sooner the better . #% So I welcome the strong language in our compromise resolution on this . #% However , the principal point that the Liberal Group would like to make is about the funds for decommissioning in the nuclear sector . #% My invitation to the House is to delete paragraph 15 . #% The Centre can not be closed : that would be inhumane and just displace the problem . #% Also , the Commission should round up those entrepreneurs tempted to cheat tourists and consumers by unfairly rounding up the euro exchange rate . #% So this amendment was not tabled out of malice , but out of experience and a desire to be helpful , in my usual style . #% Although this is relevant to the European Parliament and although I know that Mr Cook is a long-time proponent of PR , would he agree with the attitude taken by his colleague , Mr Straw , the Home Secretary , that the electoral regions will be very large , and that it is highly unlikely that an individual candidate will be known by more than a fraction of the electorate in that region ? #% Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , the Committee on Fisheries accepts that in extending the rules concerning restructuring and structural assistance in the fisheries sector for one year , changes need to be made in the pilot reduction rates in order to maintain current levels . #% The reference in paragraph 4 of the resolution to the right of self-defence is incorrect and a distortion of the United Nations Charter . #% But this Magdalena Medio region has been subject to an incursion by those same guerrillas . #% It is good to see Europe following Britain ' s lead . #% If the American Government gives in to this type of pressure , what is the European Union - and the Commission in particular - going to do to protect its steel companies ? #% The other point I want to raise is in connection with pension provisions and about the rights and abilities of staff to be able to decide to whom their pension should be paid and what flexibility they have in making that decision or in opting for whom their payment and benefit provision should be made in the event of their death . #% I speak as someone with a deep and abiding love for Italy and its people , but I say here to you today , and to President Ciampi of Italy , that Italy had neither the moral nor the legal right to sign the Treaty of Amsterdam until it had removed this most blatant violation of the Convention from its own constitution . #% First of all we have to isolate the fact that European taxpayers ' money has to be spent with transparency - and at the moment it is not . #% I would therefore hope that the people of Britain could have the chance to drive the final nail into the coffin of this wretched treaty . #% Could you please ensure that the administration gives priority to solving this problem , which is deeply inconvenient ? #% At the Brussels summit last week , which I followed with great interest , not one Member State asked for any amount above the EUR 200 million . #% However , as I say , if you want to approve the appointments , with which I concur , then you should vote against the resolutions . #% Europe needs direction on being more flexible and responsive . #% It is most important therefore that a stable and broad-based coalition Government , with strong elements of continuity , is put in place as soon as possible to implement the necessary programme of modernisation and reform with urgency and effectiveness . #% Of course , this can not be done in one country ; it can not be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation . #% It is the most disgraceful outburst I have heard from a Commissioner in a long time . #% This is partly explained by Hizbollah 's outrageous tactic of using human shields to launch its rockets from civilian-populated areas . #% These are debates that will come later this afternoon . #% For example , for too long passengers have suffered when airlines have cancelled or delayed flights for purely commercial reasons . #% She has done an admirable job . #% I am sure all of us will be encouraged but we all want to see the pressure continue . #% 
However , in conclusion , I feel I must reiterate the warning I made earlier that we need an agreement on flight time limitation before 1 May from our social partners . #% Firstly , why do we need this programme ? #% I am struck that the common denominator with this Commission is the sheer number of them that were communists , or were very close to communism . #% Most of the reasons have been well rehearsed before and we have heard some of them again this morning . #% Conservatives largely agree with the government 's priorities for the presidency : enlargement , jobs , cleaning up the environment and the fight against crime . #% in writing . - This report has some useful references to the NATO/ISAF mission ; to the deep problems of illiteracy and ill-treatment of women ; to endemic corruption and the need for fresh thinking . #% We are convinced that the way forward for the European Union is to move towards a common EU policy on asylum . #% Due to health reasons he can not join us and , therefore , I am reading , on his behalf , the speech he prepared earlier . #% You went too quickly and were not looking in my direction . #% In addition , we had a hearing in this Parliament about the high-level working group . #% So my question is this : had Mr Farage the right to speak his mind as he did and , if not , how and on what authority is Members ' freedom of speech in this House curtailed ? #% We have heard from a number of reputable companies about the length of time it could take to get work permits for their employees , which pushed some towards using tourist visas to get their employees into the country in order to fulfil contract obligations , and others to lose business . #% If the Council and the Commission can not spell out to this House how it uses the human rights clause coherently , effectively and transparently , then how can it expect this House to be prepared to give its assent to new international agreements ? #% I note that the British organisation Surfers Against Sewage says : ` The impact of the directive will be felt particularly at the Canoe Union 's national watersports centre , where poor water quality is routinely thought to put young people at risk ' . #% Insurance supervision is an important issue . #% I want to confine myself to speaking about some of the reservations that were raised then which I hope to put to the Commission . #% We believe that the proposals that have been brought forward since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty do not match either the spirit or the letter of that treaty or , indeed , the obligations that we believe are contained within the original Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 , which , for the benefit of our listeners , governs public access to all the documents held , received or produced by the three institutions . #% The spirit industry is extremely important to us , creating jobs , status , export and tax revenue . #% I am slightly puzzled by your answer in certain respects . #% One is to make port state control more effective . #% Firstly , I would like to warn against the Commission 's proposals under Article 67 that all veterinary medicines intended for food-producing animals should be available on prescription only . #% For example , on the fifth environment action plan only 70 % of the budget was spent . #% The public will be misled ; the public will be confused ; the public will again not have confidence and trust in the labelling systems that we propose for their benefit in this House . #% Much of this effort is not easy to see by outside observers . #% That has not proved possible -- so far -- but I am sure there is a great deal in his report that we very much support . #% Last week I accompanied my own daughter to her first day of school . #% If Commissioner Fischer Boel thinks that she has strengthened her hand to negotiate with developing countries after the decision that was taken on sugar last week , then I do not know exactly what planet she is living on . #% They are the important issues we should be addressing and our amendments try to focus on those issues , because we have to try to resolve the very clear problems that the Court of Justice has raised . #% It is when we get to the end of the life of the PVC that we have a problem , as Ms McKenna said . #% After all , we are not going to lose our jobs as MEPs if we do not turn up but some of the workers might . #% It is not an expression of bad faith in President Pastrana and his attempts to pursue the peace process to point out at the same time that he has failed so far to disband the paramilitary groups , to end the abuses by the Colombian Army or to offer proper protection to human rights defenders , 25 of whom have lost their lives in the last three years . #% Of course , that debate starts here and now in March 2002 . #% In particular , we must use these councils to help achieve the fullest possible understanding of the functioning of marine ecosystems . #% As we have heard already this evening , in 1970 the railways had a 21 % share of the freight market , today just 8.5 % . #% However , both the Commission proposal and the report seem to allow too great a repetition of travel time sequences . #% Very simply , because you are missing the point . #% We are now in a situation where we need to come to an agreement with the Council on how to get national declarations that can actually satisfy not only the European Court of Auditors , but the Commission and the Member States themselves , to ensure that we can show European taxpayers that their money is being spent correctly . #% Finally , the accession signing ceremony took place at the foot of the Acropolis where the new Parthenon museum is also located . #% I am especially pleased that we are able to see Mr Richard here . #% That will all have to be negotiated between now and some time early next year . #% David Cameron , then Conservative leader and now Prime Minister , said 18 months ago that his party was wrong in its support for that 1988 law , which was subsequently repealed . #% We do not yet have the technology for renewable energy . #% I find it breathtaking that the UK Independence Party this morning said that we could turn a blind eye to human rights violations with China simply because we trade effectively with it . #% There were a few things that appeared not to be organised absolutely perfectly . #% This man is indeed a modern Hitler . #% I fully recognise the force with which he puts the point . #% Finally , to say that Latvia can begin negotiations at the end of 1999 is rather strange . #% Simply to bring forward new lists to imperil the producers and not to safeguard the consumer in the actions involved is the wrong way forward . #% Could I therefore ask Mr Byrne what he is doing about this report ? #% That has been achieved possibly beyond the wildest dreams of people a few months ago . #% On the question of the Helsinki bus contract , surely it was up to the Helsinki authorities to decide , before they put the contract out to tender , what was the optimum and most environmentally friendly bus that they wanted ? #% Secondly , there is no discernible link between those three vague priorities and the lengthy annexes containing legislative and non-legislative proposals . #% The report is a simple and practical measure that will be necessary from time to time once proper legal processes have been exhausted . #% Could he explain to us , perhaps when he replies to the debate , what more can be done during the British Presidency , given that we are going to have EMU within a matter of months now , to ensure that the goals of EMU are compatible with the goals of creating more jobs within the European Union . #% Such concepts are outdated . #% If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans , then we must have a level playing field . #% However this debate is certainly better late than never and the resulting text is a worthwhile effort to identify , regulate and nurture sustainable forms of farming which potentially offer benefits for our environment , consumers and producers , plus of course the animals . #% Member States need and support clear guidance . #% Obviously , we would all have heard an oral reply , and it is only right and proper for the reply to be made available to the whole House . #% We are talking about a very serious risk . #% Rapid opening of their markets threatens food security and sustainable livelihoods in developing countries . #% I should like to personally thank the Commission for its assistance on that point . #% However , I am bound to observe that this was after we began raising questions about possible empire-building by the Commission . #% The Danish presidency has been good to work with . #% Near my own village , I have seen what used to be wonderful fields of wheat and barley and dairy cattle being turned over to things like miscanthus and all sorts of other biofuels , wrecking our environment and pushing up the cost of food . #% The immediate need is for practical material assistance such as prefabricated housing , generators and specialist vehicles and equipment . #% 
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , ` encouraging lifelong learning ' sounds fine , does it not , with the EU working openly for the good of people and for employment ? #% I very much support that . #% Outside this Chamber a demonstration is going on which is in fundamental breach of the Rules of Parliament . #% As you are aware , he was not provided with sign language interpretation at his trial . #% Research assistants who are Baptists , Catholics and members of other denominations regularly take part in its meetings . #% For years Hamas rockets were fortunately more like fire-crackers than bombs , but since the start of 2004 , 149 high-explosive rockets have been launched from Gaza . #% Clearly the Palestinian Authority was unable or unwilling to rein in the excesses of Islamic and other terrorist groups , as we saw in the Hamas suicide bomb a month ago in Jerusalem . #% During the presidential campaign of October 2004 , the electoral code prohibited Tunisians from discussing politics in the international press , and opposition parties were given little opportunity to campaign . #% If only Mr Bushill-Matthews had been here when I first started , he would have heard some of the arguments which I wish to place before this House as to why it is important to have EU legislation . #% May I also ask the presidency how it intends to find a compromise on the difficult issue of the voting system in the Council ? #% Far from taking a marginal role , the European Union , and therefore , the European Commission will sustain a strong engagement to ensure that the conditions of those people are significantly improved . #% But it is important that we send out a clear , simple message tomorrow that if you travel in these vehicles in the future , you must wear a seatbelt and that there will be no derogations , no room for doubt . #% Seoul is an increasingly important global industrial player and it is vital that the EU engages with this country which traditionally has been closer to the US rather than us . #% Members of the public find it almost impossible to understand just how it is that we can allow fish to be caught and then thrown back dead into the sea . #% There are three main issues which I would like to concentrate on in the brief time available to me . #% With 5.5 million Europeans under the age of 25 out of work , it is clear that an effective strategy to combat the problem is needed . #% When a refugee crisis occurs , it is absolutely imperative that the Member States act as quickly as possible . #% It is certainly feared - and there is sound scientific research to show it - that these chemicals are responsible for the apparent drop in sperm counts amongst men in many Western countries . #% The Commission has not sought to enhance significantly the scope of the universal service remit and that is absolutely right . #% I want to know how , as elected Members , we are going to be involved in this process , particularly if it is going to be as closed as has been laid out for us . #% Madam President , may I suggest that you write to them as a matter of urgency to see whether this is true and , if it is , perhaps to threaten that we will stop receiving their opinions until they abandon such discrimination . #% Already a colleague has spoken this morning of a single fiscal policy . #% For now I would like you to give me a very simple reply to a very simple question of principle . #% Many countries are doing that at the moment , but there is still a long way to go . #% I am getting a lot of complaints about the way competition policy is being applied , particularly , recently , about voluntary and community sectoral organisations being treated in the same way as private sector organisations and being told that for projects they can not receive more than 50 % in total in public sector intervention . #% What is clear is that the prospect of Turkey 's accession will have a catalytic effect on the nature of the European Union ; the EU will have to drop its integrationist ambitions and become a looser community of sovereign nations . #% I think I see him smile , and this might present us with some difficulties . #% I particularly condemn the outrageous press releases prior to these votes suggested by certain political parties , which raised false worries and concerns . #% It is important that citizens and the officials of the institutions know what is reasonable behaviour so that all have a standard to which they can refer . #% Can we not therefore build on that position rather than try to take extreme positions in this particular debate ? #% An attempt was made there to improve the quality of legislation , to try to cut down on superfluous legislation and to limit the costs associated with implementing legislation . #% I tell you , disabled people around Europe now are watching to see how the Christian Democrats vote on this issue because we have passed amendments in the committee to support the disabled and they want this report off the agenda . #% The e-commerce market is at a very early stage and is still underdeveloped . #% Recently a very well-known celebrated TV presenter in the United Kingdom said to me : ` always remember that there are people who need breast implants ' . #% The full force of the law would be unleashed of course . #% Mr President , I would like to start with the point that Mr G√∂rlach finished on and that is the fact that we have elections in the European Union to the European Parliament next year . #% His services told me that the report had actually been sent to Parliament yesterday for distribution to Members . #% In that time , public-service broadcasting hardly grew at all and creative television production in the five major producing countries of the European Union was sluggish or , in some cases , falling . #% Tiny Luxembourg gets a special lift into the second group thanks to its financial markets , even though it has had a central bank for substantially fewer years than many of the candidate countries , including Poland and Hungary . #% Mr President , we have had a few problems with voting in the House this week . #% It is not enough to talk ! #% Mr President , I speak to the proposal for a Council regulation amending a regulation . #% Sir Leon Brittan says that we have other irons in the fire and that therefore we must accept the hormone/beef decision and the banana decision . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Council for the diligent way it has pursued this complicated dossier and most especially Commissioner Verheugen and his staff for the phenomenal amount of work they have done on monitoring the progress that has been achieved in the candidate countries . #% In fact the UK itself has one , even though it has never been written down all in one place -- unfortunately ! #% As a nation of tea drinkers , the British would rather like to know why it is that sucrose esters are not approved of by the Commission . #% It is absurd that in my own country , once the Prime Minister , Mr Blair , summons up the courage to confront the Chancellor , Mr Brown , we will be asked in a referendum to decide whether or not to join the single currency . #% But I think it is wise for us to ask whether these perspectives are really sufficient for the next five years . #% Mr President , Mr Rocard 's excellent speech reminded me that in my earlier speech I failed to acknowledge his role as chief observer of the Commission delegation last January . #% What we need to say is that all the global actors on the global stage need a fair and comparable opportunity to perform well . #% In the course of these events , Mrs Andreasen has definitely not been victimised . #% We are certainly not opposed to this in principle , but this really is a matter for national decision , as in the Netherlands . #% We all know by now who is going to be paying for this : the hard-pressed taxpayer and obviously - and as usual disproportionately - the British taxpayer . #% Part of that security agenda must be that we do not become Eurocentric . #% We may say now that beach angling has been exempted , but once it is under the auspices of people like you , Mr Borg , you can come back next year or the year after and start to regulate it . #% Madam President , I rise on a point of order on the issue of the recent industrial action at the French Channel ports , which caused major disruption yet again to EU citizens legitimately travelling between the United Kingdom and other Member States . #% If MEPs tomorrow accept the Council take-it-or-leave-it deal , they will have fallen victim to a vast con trick . #% These groups infiltrate Indian Kashmir , causing mayhem and making a war between the two nuclear neighbours a very real possibility . #% There is actually a loss of confidence in all forms of food aid except for emergency food aid . #% It makes the case that the number of people flying will almost double in the next fifteen years . #% I should also like to pay particular tribute to Mrs McCarthy who I have worked with in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% The report also recommends that we bring to an end , although this will be phased in , the dual mandate whereby Members sit both in the European Parliament and in their national parliament . #% It is increasingly an international problem and one where mediation will , in my view , become essential . #% There are rumours circulating that the Council is backing away from the use of vaccination , downgrading it on the scale of its importance . #% President Prodi is right to say that the procedure needs improving , but we have a procedure to negotiate such improvements , the Malmstr√∂m report in our committee for example . #% We want it to work but at each stage it must keep pace with levels of consumer protection that match the sophistication of those who might prey upon the consumer . #% 
This is a logical step and one which all of us should accept as a matter of course . #% While I welcome CITES and everything it is trying to do , the fact that the conference is to be held in Thailand will give us an opportunity to raise these issues with the Thai Government , so as to help stop such things happening . #% The municipal elections were postponed . #% I recognise also that this impetus to civilisation came about because those seats of learning evolved separately and independently , with each developing its own particular flavour and identity . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , it is hard for us to imagine the sheer physical and moral courage required by Mr Liu to stand up against the murderous tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party . #% We want something with a real sense that you are putting priorities on delivering the real foundations of the European Union and making the internal market work better , and not just coming out with a whole set of uncosted priorities that look good on paper but in respect of which there is no idea as to whether they are really going to work in practice . #% It was a concern at the early stages of the text that a ` one size fits all ' framework designed for equities was being imposed on the bond markets . #% Let us hope that the conciliation procedure taking place tomorrow will recognise the need to give a higher priority to Europe ' s students and increase the funding . #% The families will tell you of their burning sense of injustice at this state of affairs and their anger that the killer of their loved one will continue to lead their own life , see their own children grow , spend time with friends and all of those things that they have robbed from their victim . #% However , we need also , as Mrs Smet has said , a much wider range of initiatives designed to tackle the structural disadvantages suffered by women on the labour market . #% Could Parliament remind the airlines that the flights on the Monday morning of the Strasbourg session will need to take a large number of Members of this Parliament , not just from Heathrow but from other places as well . #% While I appreciate the work that has been done in the Council , I have to say there is a great worry within this Parliament that it may now be the Council that is starting to drag its feet . #% I should also like to congratulate Mrs Morgan on her discharge report . #% In any event , as a result , I understand , of a Community initiative , the International Accounting Standards Council is going to consider the whole question of accounting issues and SMEs , which of course is something which is entirely separate from what we are discussing now . #% Mr President , in all my time on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , this is the first time that I can recall that one of our major directives has received such prominence in the Parliamentary agenda . #% in writing . - Despite efforts around the globe and commitments from many international institutions , the EU included , the fight against poverty is still far from won . #% This House seeks a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis and welcomes the work Kofi Annan is undertaking to resolve it . #% Finally , a word on costs . #% I think of Burma - on which I shall speak tomorrow - and Zimbabwe , where millions of people are suffering under Mugabe 's tyranny , a situation shamefully tolerated and encouraged by leaders in some African countries in the region . #% Clearly , this is a particularly sensitive area because of both its strategic nature and some of the industrial policy issues surrounding the whole defence sector . #% However , we believe that the common position as amended in committee is a positive step forward . #% Mr President , I would also like to pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Vitorino over the last five years . #% One very heavy storm or two or three weeks of very dry weather at the wrong time of the year can make all the difference as to whether they make a profit or loss on a whole year 's work . #% We know from the statistics and the information - and I am sure we will hear from the Commission shortly - that transposition of this instrument has been delayed in just about every Member State . #% This pattern should stop as it undermines the work of the EU and this Parliament . #% I was very curious to know why , given that one censure motion has already been tabled , certain Members saw fit to table another motion of censure which , at least under our Rules , should not and could not take place at the same time . #% We in the PPE-DE Group concur with Mr Duff 's approach and the analysis contained in the report 's explanatory statement . #% There can be no question of admitting countries whose judicial system is corrupt or inept , or whose administrative capacity is not up to the task ahead . #% It is a nonsense that we simultaneously export and import precisely the same product to and from the same country and it is clear that it is not small farmers ' livelihoods , animal welfare or the tourist industry that the UK Government has as its priority for protection , but simply our meat exports . #% As the Commissioner might remember - and I am sure his departments will - this was an initiative which was to help end corrupt practices . #% Halting deforestation is one of the ways that we should be tackling climate change , and governments around the globe have been trying to do this for years . #% The decision with regard to the money for Kosovo is helpful and their other agreements have , generally speaking , made the Committee on the Environment relatively happy . #% Mr President , I too welcome these reports and , with particular reference to Mrs Almeida Garrett 's report , I welcome the proposals to extend the Ombudsman 's right of access to all documents . #% The European Union and international financial institutions should play their part in assisting an effective reform programme . #% The new Rule , however , leaves no option but to vote against certain reports . #% We need more measures ; we need aviation fuel tax . #% This is not something that you can say is open . #% This is in clear violation of Security Council Resolution 1373 forbidding states from sponsoring terrorism against other states . #% . I voted against the resolution in relation to the World Conference against Racism in Durban to make it clear that this conference has done the gravest possible disservice to the promotion of good race relations . #% But we in the European Parliament - what are we doing ? #% In fact , I believe we have covered most of the bases when it comes to consumer protection in aviation , but there is clearly a loophole here that needs to be closed . #% From 2009 all least developed countries should benefit from the same guaranteed price as that provided for in the ACP Sugar Protocol . #% There is also the problem of Paragraph a ) in the composite resolution which suggests that terrorists who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity can be tried under the Court 's provisions . #% I believe this is a problem particularly related to Strasbourg , which , of course , is another joy of coming here . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the Commissioner on his position with the proposals , of course , as always to protect consumer health . #% He told how he had been beaten , how he feared daily for his wife and his family and , just as we have also heard , he feared what would happen to him when he returns on 17 March . #% We have to make sure that when national parliaments are setting their national budgets there is a feeling that there is a democratic body at a European level overseeing the monetary policy that is being set in the name of the citizens of the European Union , on behalf of the whole European Union . #% The line adopted by EU governments , led by Minister Ed Miliband , have won support and offer real hope of a deal . #% As we know , CFCs are much more environmentally damaging than HFCs , being ozone-depleting gases which we have very successfully grappled with under the auspices of the Montreal Protocol . #% For too long international opinion has been distorted on this issue and the Turkish Cypriots have not had a fair hearing . #% We have also heard many vague ideas about how we are going to reform it and I put to you one or two ideas that I believe to be important . #% It is important that Members of Parliament and committees look carefully at the issues raised by Mr Katiforis in his report , but we do not want to prejudge the outcome and say at this point that yes , we should have a European registration authority . #% So it will not be very long , Mr President , before the British are not going to be paying any money into the European Union . #% Mr President , concerns about the effects of GMOs on human health are in the minds of many of us overshadowed by doubts about their effects upon other species of plants or animal life and about the control of the world 's seed bank by a handful of companies . #% Mr President , first of all I must apologise for my absence from the committee when my amendments to the Esclop√© report were discussed . #% I wonder whether you can give us any information at this stage whether there is any intention to honour the wish of the House and refer this to committee , or whether there is somebody attempting some sort of cover up ? #% What it does not record is the deep concern we have expressed about misuse of structural fund moneys to benefit privatized services including Anglia Water in my own constituency in Essex in the UK . #% A lot of resources will be needed to rebuild the country , and the EU is a large donor ; in my view this entitles us to lay down significant political conditions , including demanding progress in human rights , particularly women 's rights to education and access to the workforce . #% As Commissioner Verheugen quite rightly said : we must take advantage of this window of opportunity before it is closed . #% My information is that something like 2000 tonnes of Brazilian poultry have entered the EU in this way . #% I would like to praise Commissioner Kinnock for his reforms at the Commission , although there has been one blind spot . #% I hope that we can get this through as amended and continue the vast amount of work still to be done in this area . #% Would she please confirm to me that she is not intending to impose regulation in the marketplace that would require operators to deliver services below cost , because that would mean low-income users of mobile phones subsidising the premium rates of customers such as MEPs ? #% Ireland used to have a more open policy than it has now . #% The EU set up this agency as part of the work essential for the completion of the internal market . #% As part of the suggested awareness campaign , we should also look at the possibility of funding the promotion of seafaring at secondary-school level . #% 
The cosmetics industry is about marketing glamour , dreams and illusions and I am not as critical as some previous speakers about this . #% It is important that we safeguard cooperatives and their parity of status , particularly at a time of increased competition and threats of globalisation , when there is a considerable threat of undermining the cooperative ethos and its way of operating . #% It was wonderful to get that article into the Treaties but when we commit ourselves to a programme of this kind , we must provide the necessary funding so that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds , minorities and other groups are not put to the bottom of the list , which may well otherwise be the case . #% The question which people are now asking is whether NATO is really capable of acting and whether it will be really effective once it has more central and eastern European countries ? #% I also join in what colleagues have been saying about issues to do with taxation and company law . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , discards are just one aspect of the nightmare that is the CFP . #% Mr President , Castro 's Cuba has tried to present itself to the world as a model of anti-colonialism and social justice . #% The corrigendum affects the very issue which was the substance of the only significant argument in committee . #% This is the beginning of a very long debate before we reach the stage of legislation . #% Fidel Castro has failed to understand that the world has changed , and few of us were prepared for the recent crackdown on 33 dissidents , the rushed secret trials and the outrageous call for the death penalty for a Christian Democratic leader . #% We also call upon the Council and the UN Commission on Human Rights to give full support to the drafting of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances . #% The influx of people seeking asylum from certain of these eastern European countries at the present time calls into question the situation in certain of these countries and makes it urgently necessary for them to introduce effective legislation to protect their ethnic minorities . #% We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , Commissioner , accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct , particularly when considering appointments and promotion . #% Mrs Mussolini has not even had the courtesy to come to see me about what was purportedly written in the English press . #% Finally , I should like to mention access to medicines . #% The Commission may introduce an emergency ban where there is a clear and immediate danger , but no such danger exists with phthalates . #% What we would like to do is to encourage them to look after their investors . #% Finally , we must never forget that the right to petition enshrined in the Treaties is an important example of the exercise of citizens ' democratic rights and their ability to hold the institutions and their Member States to account . #% However , it misses one major strategic point and that arises from the fact that European citizens are very much more concerned about GMOs and their potential effects than other populations , particularly in North America . #% The report adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - which is the basis for the motion for a resolution before the House today - contains several findings and recommendations . #% That is why it is legitimate for Parliament to examine this question . #% I should also like to thank the Ethiopian Government for its hospitality and effective administration in Addis Ababa . #% I do not think you were being completely fair with us , Commissioner , when you said it will only go so far and no further . #% We have a useful report , which clearly underlines the wish of Parliament to enhance the fight against fraud , maladministration and the abuse of European taxpayers . #% It could immediately be functional if it was transferred from genetically-modified maize into a bacterium , for example in an animal 's stomach . #% He will not want history to see him coming out of a six-month Presidency without a deal and that is why there will be a deal . #% Britain 's asylum system is already a mess , with thousands upon thousands of cases pending and applicants simply lost and gone to ground . #% Mrs Paciotti , you will continue to get spam ! #% The rapporteur rightly says that what we need is a clearly defined framework covering issues that are common to all financial services legislation , supplemented by vertical measures covering issues such as the distance-selling of financial products and the market for credit . #% We very much welcome the practical report from Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and the recognition of the need to use all the available talents to really tackle discrimination , whether that be in terms of the gender pay gap , discrimination against black and minority ethnic groups , or in terms of disability or age . #% The last thing we need now is to add to the democratic deficit . #% The UN can not make threats without being prepared to carry them out . #% Although it is complex it is an issue to which we have to take a practical approach . #% That is true , but what they lose is the status of registered partnership and the tax or social rights that go with that - for instance , the right to be recognised as next of kin if one of them is in hospital . #% Please vote for common sense tomorrow and on Wednesday . #% There they will find a genuinely bold and ambitious call to action . #% I trust these measures are being made on a genuine basis and that they have been worked out in full concertation with the Turkish Cypriot authorities . #% Indeed , it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources . #% In this House we constantly pay lip service to the needs of SMEs , yet again and again we ignore their concerns . #% Given the pets ' passport project at European level and a right for pets now to move freely within the European Union as a result , does the Commission have any legal competence to intervene and protect animal welfare and , in particular , these domestic pets in Germany , of which there will be a needless slaughter potentially and possibly even extinction of a fine breed of British dogs ? #% There can be no question of forcing ACP countries to open up their markets to European goods until their own domestic markets are much more firmly established . #% As a lawyer in private practice in the UK , I myself , have often wrestled with a pile of books to find the right rules and the right way to go forward for my clients in these circumstances . #% Then Mrs Maij-Weggen , on behalf of her committee , said that what they really want is zero content . #% Mr President , it is a pleasure that this morning this House can have a diversion from the distant drumbeats of war to the needs of the citizen as consumer . #% Therefore we must make this distinction between third country and Community carriers or operators . #% Mr President , I should like to start by acknowledging the work which Mr Lehne has put into this report , even though I have not always agreed with him . #% He is wise to recommend that Parliament gives its assent to the position that the Council has adopted . #% All they do is snipe from the sidelines , usually on the basis of ignorance , because they are unwilling to get engaged in the real work that we are doing across the political spectrum in this House to ensure that the legislation and policies the Union produces are properly scrutinised and are a fair balance of interests of our different Member States and our different political viewpoints . #% These rules on whistle-blowing will be put forward for introduction into the amended Staff Regulations and officials who follow them would not be subject to disciplinary action . #% I ridicule the appeasing statement by the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jack Straw , who claims that military action is inconceivable , whereas his boss , Prime Minister Tony Blair , rightly refuses to rule it out . #% So that figure can be somewhat misleading . #% Therefore , the disclosure requirements will be tailored to particular circumstances . #% I was not in the Chamber when she made her comments about ECOSOC , but I am sure she is now with me in calling for this organisation not only not to get discharge but actually to be disbanded because it is a waste of money . #% Cooperation should be increased between Member States in the European Union through common penalties for offenders and police services working together across the Member States . #% They are bringing forward far too much legislation and , with legislation , quality is usually in inverse proportion to quantity . #% . I am supporting this report because of the amendment to Paragraph 6 of the original , discussed in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . #% Is a strategy being put in place to deal with that ? #% Japan , where apparently the word ` conservation ' actually means buy en masse , kill the fish , and freeze them for 20 or 30 years so that they can be eaten in a couple of decades time . #% It is the best quality support . #% There are also a worryingly substantial number of cases before the European Court of Justice on breaches of legislation , particularly in the field of interconnections - again , matters on which the former Commissioner has intimate knowledge . #% This is an absolute nonsense and we should not be looking to extend these subsidies , we should be looking to reduce the quotas so that we are at the very least cutting out the export subsidy . #% My guilt at not hearing Mr Trakatellis is slightly mollified by the fact that he is not here to hear me . #% I just want to address the question of why we on this side have chosen to propose a motion of rejection . #% Finally , I urge the Commission to bring forward its proposed regulation on orphan drugs as soon as possible , to work with the pharmaceutical companies to ensure support for care today as well as cure tomorrow for patients experiencing both isolation and uncertainty from their illness . #% in writing . - Belarus remains largely ostracised by the European Union due to President Lukashenko 's authoritarian rule . #% And , at least until 2013 , the Parliament itself must be involved in the negotiation of this financial perspective once the negotiations are under way . #% 
We need to rebuild a western strategic culture . #% I also want to thank the Commission for carrying out its intermediary role , mindful of law and precedent , but also of the strong views of this Parliament which have been echoed here under three different Commissions , for more than ten years . #% Mr Barroso himself is no better , because when he is not working in the Commission he is off on luxury yachts , holidaying with the super-rich . #% I think everyone here tonight is working on legislation in the electronic age . #% Mr President , this should prove a popular moment in this House and I am grateful for the massive turnout for the continuation of the debate on drugs in sport . #% Financial regulators play a key role in prosecution and criminal justice , and these are matters which should remain within the remit of the Member States . #% I commend very fully all the points that are laid out in clear chronological sequence in paragraph 8 of the report , where there are a whole series of matters on which this House , as part of the budgetary authority , needs further information . #% Was it a victory , a disaster or an unexpected welcome break in Seattle ? #% Prime Minister Blair agreed with me then ; now he embraces the Constitution as it has been drawn up . #% Creditors will be entitled to charge a statutory interest rate of 7 % on their debts , encouraging debtors to pay early . #% Could you comment on that specific point , Commissioner ? #% This would put European manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage as compared with the big boys from the Far East . #% What about the victims of medical negligence , industrial injury or any other type of claim against insurers ? #% Finally there is the Haug report which no one else has mentioned but I need to mention it . #% The people who believe that the EU should legislate in the finest detail , the people who are piling on more burdens on business without even understanding that is what they are doing , are not some unelected Brussels bureaucrats , they are Britain 's very own Labour MEPs . #% We should also mention the importance of maintaining a degree of choice and competition in the marketplace for consumers . #% Perhaps she will agree that the imperative is that the lessons learned from that should not have to be relearned during the World Cup next year . #% By forcing economic dependency on that country it was actually counterproductive in terms of democracy . #% I should like to begin with a few positives . #% Amsterdam recognizes , in a way that Maastricht did not , that we are now operating in a completely new security situation following the end of the Cold War which requires broader instruments and broader measures to maintain European and world security . #% For the Commission proposals to be successful three factors will be crucial . #% The Commission , is , however , not aware of any decision to construct such a tunnel link and the Commission has not received any request for Community support for such a project . #% In fact we need to totally renegotiate the 1951 Geneva Convention and think again . #% 1 January 2007 is an achievable date for Bulgaria 's accession to the European Union . #% This proposal to extract oil from the continental shelf off the Russian island of Sakhalin threatens not only the economy and way of life of the island 's inhabitants , but also poses a potential environmental disaster of alarming proportions . #% Our deficit levels are at historic highs in several Member States , as the President of the Council has indicated . #% There is a real problem in obtaining money for clinical trials . #% Some agencies are crucial to our citizens , and we are not providing them with sufficient funding to do the job we expect from them . #% We must tackle that particular problem . #% We say 1999 , they say 2001 . #% When those on the Left give us a comprehensive analysis of those problems , we might consider it , but we have far more important things to do today than to talk about their political declaration . #% The lives of many disabled people have been made an absolute misery by the current situation in which disability benefits can not be exported . #% Does anyone here seriously imagine that by seizing control over company law relating to SMEs , the European Union will change or improve that situation ? #% It is vital for the future safety of mankind that international humanitarian law is respected and that transgressors know they will be punished . #% Madam President , I should like to challenge three assumptions in the questions that have been put to the Council and the Commission . #% If you look at the figures , in 2009 , Japan and the EU together represented more than a quarter of global GDP and more than 20 % of world trade , and had a combined volume of foreign direct investment of about EUR 200 billion . #% That includes the developing world as well . #% One of them was transport of animals . #% Let us have some consistency . #% I now move to the points being made by the Committee on Budgets . #% The Lebanon is a focal point from which we can operate and through which we can operate . #% And when - rather than if - we achieve codecision in this area , this will enable Parliament to require the Commission to re-examine the measures if the implementing measures are exceeded . #% What is more , they are statements and nothing is really gained because the work has already been done . #% If boards become too big to assume their responsibilities in practice , agencies become vulnerable to become private fiefdoms an example of which we have seen in Eurostat . #% Mr President , can I simply point out to Members that the signing-in sheets are now back inside the Chamber . #% Two years after the Council regulation was passed I do not think there is mainstreaming of gender issues in Europe 's development policies . #% We may not want to be negotiators ourselves , but our ambition is to play a full part in the meetings with the European Union delegation that decides how Europe will act . #% I accept that a brickie 's cleavage is not a pretty sight , but we have no business in this House making rules about it . #% I also wish to thank the Commissioner for her reply . #% In relation to Afghanistan it is to be hoped that a legitimate government with democratic aspirations will be established there very soon , anxious to engage positively in the real world and begin the development of a sustainable economy and a better life for all its people . #% This is not the first time that progress , and even the right of defence prior to hearings or to appeal , seems to have been compromised by the Commission denying undertakings access to full information or evidence against them . #% We will fulfil that commitment . #% The reference was clearly intended to place that fellowship within a pejorative context . #% This is hardly the safe , well-functioning market that we had in mind to create , nor have we got the level of confidence that we really need . #% We heard from Mr Parish that there is a problem of cooked and chilled meats coming in . #% Madam President , I welcome the commitment shown by the Commissioner to these issues and indeed for giving us the clear understanding that it goes beyond just enjoying Oxfam chocolates . #% Somebody had put a bed across the bathroom door and so she could not get in . #% I hope on future occasions the Commission and the Council might consider taking some parliamentarians along , particularly in the light of the fact that relations between North Korea and the European Union were pioneered by the European Parliament , over two years ago , when we sent our first official delegation . #% But , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civilised . #% It is very encouraging that the amendments that I put forward at first reading with regard to abatement technology were taken on board . #% We need to be sure of how we are going to deal with these additives , especially in poultry . #% That importantly means they explain what they are not going to do as well as what they are going to do . #% I have to wear my hat as the rapporteur and speak as the rapporteur , knowing full well that the Chairman is keeping a watchful eye on what I say . #% Firstly , we need a clear understanding of the purpose and objectives of a common foreign policy . #% However , when a matter is delegated to an agency with its own structure -- usually intergovernmental -- and its own board , which is accountable in a totally different way , then the accountability is inevitably lessened . #% The two countries have also recently begun talks on fighting floods which have deluged both countries with tragic consequences . #% 
Finally , I would like to add my congratulations to Mrs Buitenweg and to Mr Howitt in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for working so closely together to put forward an excellent report . #% The PPE-DE/PSE resolution also calls on the Commission to give an opinion on the text of the Legal Affairs Committee before it has been discussed by us in plenary . #% in writing . - I abstained on the original text of paragraph 1 ( 6 ) because the idea of calling for new proposals on own resources through tax initiatives and other possible programmes such as ETs represents a potential for EU-style taxes . #% We are left with an imbalance in the Commission and it is there that I believe we need to make some progress . #% If we had a debate about every instance of that across the European Union , we would be here debating those issues every day of the week . #% Efforts must now be made to tone down the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic . #% It has to be taken into consideration that in the approval of a substance like aspartame the SCF sets the allowed daily intake in which the vulnerable life phases are included at a level such that even the heaviest users of the substance will not exceed 30-40 % of that maximum intake . #% We have some tough and difficult climbs to get through at the moment . #% But we have to ask ourselves , are the figures now so low as to make the objectives unrealistic ? #% We have regular reports of the continued use of the death penalty and inhuman and degrading treatment in prisons with reports of the use of torture . #% Parliament has also said that certain products should be excluded where it would be nonsense insisting on unit pricing , such as furniture and so on . #% Instead there should be a consistent , coherent approach based on a clear strategy to remove Mugabe 's boot from the neck of his people . #% Mr President , may I start by saying how much I welcome the Commissioner 's remarks , and also those of the Danish Presidency . #% The freedom of the opposition parties contending for the remaining seats was demonstrated last June when Megawati Sukarnoputri , daughter of former President Sukarno was replaced through government action by Mr Suryadi of whom the government approved . #% I should like to see that go on the label . #% In my view , failure by Turkey to come to terms with its past , including the 1915 Armenian genocide and the blockade of the Republic of Armenia , is deeply regrettable . #% What action is being taken to address the shortcomings ? #% What I experienced , as I tried to interest everything from local transport authorities in Kishinev through to energy ministries in Uzbekistan was the following : just as in so many other EU policy areas , in TACIS projects we perhaps try to do too much across too many geographical boundaries in too many sectors . #% Can it continue to implement the reform of the Commission so it will be entirely modernised by the end of 2004 ? #% But politics is not like that . #% No deal is better than a bad deal . #% It does not appear to be British and European workers , since Mittal will make an estimated USD 1 billion from this deal . #% As colleagues will be aware , Parliament has had a working group very ably chaired by our colleague Dagmar Roth-Behrendt which has been looking into improving the workings of our Parliament . #% I welcome the parliamentary majority for the continuation of the work of this Temporary Committee . #% If the British Presidency is genuinely going to show international leadership on this subject , then it has to get its own house in order first . #% The Commission should have thought very carefully after that initial rejection . #% Over and over again we see well-meaning programmes like this that fail to deliver . #% The only way to do that is to have some effective template from which this can be made . #% In addition , econometric models are now published in the working paper series . #% So far , only seven have done so , Parliament urges the remaining 18 Member States to ratify as soon as possible . #% But , frankly , I find it extraordinary that Mr Solana and Mr Blair and several others can float the idea of creating an executive committee formed out of the Council presidency without referring to the role of the European Commission . #% I realise that this is a significant suggestion , but my fear is that if we do not at least consider this , we will be sending a very divisive message to many ethnic minority communities at a key time of integration . #% So could we please have those answers from the Commission ? #% It was always ridiculous to suppose that a government having trouble paying its bills could be punished by imposing a fine ; yet , as the European Central Bank points out , sound fiscal policies are vital for the euro . #% Nevertheless , the Commission is in the driving seat here and should be much readier to accept the advice , coming from friends , which will enable it to face the citizens of Europe much more confidently . #% Again , I want to thank all of you who are engaged in that great effort on behalf of all European citizens . #% We can already feel the effects . #% Mr President , I can not begin to express my delight at seeing the presidency here today and at noting the presence throughout this debate of Commissioner Kinnock which recalls the effective cooperation between the two gentlemen in the past - particularly , of course , in a certain leadership campaign in 1983 . #% If it were , we would support it . #% We are generally in broad agreement with the Council and Commission in their recommendations on this , in terms of adequate income support , and this report uses that phrase . #% By their very nature , British Conservatives oppose such restrictive legislation being piled on business and the consumer , and we are not alone . #% Please let us act with the sustainability of resources and of industry and with communities in mind . #% Where in all of this , given that you are in charge , is the principle of democratic accountability ? #% One of the benefits of the single market is that people can now own property anywhere in the European Union . #% We would also like to ask for real dialogue within this , not just economic propaganda . #% The second point is a practical one : we have put a lot of work into our directive on tariff transparency and publication , to encourage Member States particularly to address the issues of tariff transparency and comparison for private consumers and for small businesses . #% It bears repeating time after time that the chief responsibilities of Member States are to process asylum claims expeditiously , to rapidly integrate those who are accepted and to remove those who are not . #% I have not heard anyone explain how that will work . #% Mr President , I very much regret that this is the second time in six months that we are having to debate foot-and-mouth disease in this House . #% It would have been much better for both parties to have kept their original positions and for the legislation to have fallen . #% It is gratifying for those of us who were Members of the Convention to see that , despite some initial posturing , most members of the European Council appear now to be accepting the outcome of the Convention with few qualifications . #% We are trying to find a wording that will address the issue : whether to call it Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Indian-administered Kashmir , as I have suggested . #% Then there are people travelling , who want health care abroad with the E112 . #% I believe , however , that the conclusion of this agreement will facilitate the continuing dialogue on these issues which will give the European Parliament far more leverage than if the agreement did not go ahead . #% I find that totally reprehensible and I hope all right-thinking people in this House will feel the same . #% Why should they seek to place their country alongside brutal Iran , which regularly executes homosexuals in public ? #% However , we urge more radical reform of the overall budget . #% Mr President , the Commission decision to lift the ban on the export of derivatives is very welcome news and it is , of course , consistent with the previous statements that Mr Fischler has made , on a number of occasions , on the basis of scientific evidence . #% Amending the Treaty on European Union to include Article 5 of the WEU Treaty is also not a feasible option . #% I heard it said that in the referenda so far , more people have voted ` yes ' than ` no ' across all countries and that therefore we should be going ahead with this wonderful Constitution . #% We do not see how any Member State can possibly oppose that . #% A loophole exists in these agreements , whereby EU fleet owners have been known to complete a trawler 's fishing to gain full hulls , and then declare technical problems . #% This is something which the committee as a whole felt strongly about in the resolution on the annual economic report and it is a significant omission that it is not in the resolution to wind up this debate . #% Therefore , we must deeply consider who we allow access to this data and why ; not just to which country but which agencies . #% Many reactors of exactly the same kind as Chernobyl - in some cases in worse condition than Chernobyl - still exist and are in operation in Russia and other parts of the CIS . #% What were the arguments ? #% 
I opposed many of the amendments that Mr Lange first proposed to the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , but I am happy to say that since then he has put in an enormous amount of work to negotiate compromises with the Council , the vast majority of which I am happy to endorse . #% I should add that all the emphasis that we , as Europeans , place on the need for increased legitimacy and transparency in the WTO will come to nothing if we do not reform the way in which we conduct our own trade policy in the European Union . #% We all very much hope that this new way of dealing with financial regulations will prove to be a step change in creating a single market , the foundations of which have been put in place by the creation of the euro and its successful introduction . #% Lastly , we have often pioneered the idea of interinstitutional cooperation . #% But I am not as worried about that as I am , perhaps , about the reports that offal and bonemeal are still being fed to French animals . #% Overall , as Commission Wallstr√∂m said , we will soon have 16 States in favour . #% After 30 years of the CFP , Britain 's waters no longer teem with fish . #% I hope that the Austrian presidency might address this issue and ensure that , as a matter of course , a Council representative attends every meeting of the Petitions Committee . #% As Mr Harbour reminded us , last November the large majority of this House gave support to his report which explicitly favoured the principle of making significant change - not the status quo or anything like it - in order to establish a more linear career system for the European civil service , for all the reasons he was kind enough to set out again tonight . #% The main concern for me is the persistent rumour , just repeated by Mrs Lynne , that either now or in the near future the Commission will include the withdrawal of the directive on temporary agency work . #% The Commission 's latest report on behaviour that has seriously infringed the rules of the common fisheries policy demonstrates once again how uneven the playing field currently is . #% I acknowledge that this report was always going to be difficult and sympathise with the rapporteur , who is in a lose-lose situation . #% Relatives who are the heirs of the murdered victims have been denied compensation for the absurd reason that the Nazi barbarians did not issue death certificates and post them to those Jews who managed to escape the gas chambers and the pits of death which the Nazis planned as the fate for all the Jewish people . #% His behaviour is a disgrace and a scandal . #% The solution can only lie in the transfer of political control , working with the support of the United Nations , in order to support the emergence of a peaceful , democratic and prosperous Iraq . #% That is why we will support Paragraph 59 in the resolution . #% The first point is to look at the economic fundamentals which the Commission claims are favourable . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I object to this request . #% My final point is that the use of caged beds in some of the existing Member States is definable as inhumane and I hope to take that topic up with you personally as well . #% But we should not just be lowering the 1 000 m2 threshold in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive - we should be getting rid of it altogether and applying the Directive to all buildings requiring heating and cooling , regardless of size . #% Could the Commissioner tell me if , as part of the impact assessment that the Commission will be carrying out , there will be a rigorous cost/benefit analysis of the Commission 's proposal , taking into account all factors ? #% We need to know at what cost it was to South Africa that the developed world ignored the pleas of Nelson Mandela and the people of South Africa . #% Our economies want migrants . #% I was about to welcome Mrs. Schreyer to her first debate and all of a sudden I see him there . #% For the institution to retain its competitiveness as an international employer , it should be introduced in a targeted way in the Commission . #% The one constant in all this is the presence of the Varroa mite which attacks the bees ' immune system and is probably the root cause of this whole problem . #% So it is not easy . #% The answer is not to clamour for BSE-free regions or zones but to recognize that throughout the European Union we are a single zone which needs total security , safety , traceability and vigilance as the soundest basis for consumer confidence and for beef to be traded once again throughout the Community on its merits and in a market where that confidence has been restored . #% The Soviet communists were , of course , allies of the Nazis for the first 20 months of the War . #% That would be good for the students of Europe , the City of Strasbourg , France , this Parliament and Europe . #% This is the first time I have been involved in a trialogue , so I have been able to study the process at work . #% In answer to the last question , Mr President , you said that transparency was one of the great priorities of the Finnish Presidency . #% We must ensure that we are able to progress steadily to amend the common position . #% We all hope that the Year will provide an incentive to those Member States that are being particularly tardy on implementing the Article 13 Directives to make progress . #% REACH is not about the control of chemicals ; it is about bureaucrats responding to the multinationals , both sides of an unspoken agreement happy to exploit the insatiable desire for yet more social engineering and centralised control . #% In this part of the debate I seem to be a voice in the wilderness , but I will carry on . #% Next year I would like to make it earlier still , and I would look for the earliest possible feedback from the Commission to make this possible . #% This is a joint debate involving consideration of the importance of work , information and consultation . #% The last phrase of this interesting document says that the duration of the next financial perspective could be brought into line with the five-year mandate of the Commission and of the European Parliament . #% Madam President , I signalled I wanted to raise a point of order , although it is not actually on the Minutes . #% All the social partners except the ETUC want to keep the opt-out . #% How do you prioritise the agenda if you have already set eight strategic themes ? #% Clearly , we do so by having a stability pact which will maintain discipline between Member State budgets . #% NAFO inspectors are obliged to carry out their duties in accordance with rules set out in the NAFO scheme and they are also obliged to remain under the operational control of the authorities of their contracting parties and be responsible to them . #% Many companies do not have a policy for dealing with stress . #% Instruments directly linked to the impact in question , such as a NOx charge , would be most likely to induce the most efficient behaviour , although multipliers on CO2 emissions are an interim alternative . #% However , spare a thought for Simeon ' s unfortunate Italian cousin , Prince Victor Emmanuel of Savoy and his son Philibert , who are not only formally barred from standing from public office in their country , a founder Member of the EU unlike Bulgaria , but have nurtured the dream since childhood of being allowed to enter the territory of the country of which they are citizens both by birth and descent . #% Subsequently it launched further , separate infringement proceedings covering the regulatory regime post-2001 . #% In the ten years I have been in Parliament I have had responsibility either as the budget rapporteur or the shadow budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , often working very closely with Mrs Iivari . #% It is urgent that we put pressure on them to withdraw support for these measures so that this Parliament can stand up for the people of Tibet , stand up for democracy , stand up for the stopping of what is an illegal act in international law . #% And they are imprisoned only because of the European Arrest Warrant . #% The present situation is not good for patients or doctors alike - they have our life in their hands . #% The recognition by Mao 's successor Deng Xiao Ping and his successors of some capitalist and free market realities has enabled China to progress economically to the point it has reached today . #% In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday . #% I can assure them that we will vigorously oppose that tomorrow . #% But above all we wish Commissioner Palacio , with our support , to press the Council of Ministers and all those associated with this to take urgent decisions . #% Democratic institutions are weak and press freedom is scarce . #% We want them , as well , to continue the efforts to change the blasphemy law because this is a law that is more abused than properly used . #% These commitments , alongside international development targets , should be a central focus at Seattle . #% In the UK Independence Party we have recognised that this will not be possible . #% I take great pride in the fact that our institution has , in a full and very exact account , set out everything there is to be said about the salaries , the career structure , and the allowance systems that have been available to European civil servants . #% To my Eurosceptic friends , I say that this is not some subversive plot . #% My group is not in favour of reducing the threshold to 500 because of the burden on small - and medium-sized businesses , nor are we in favour of increasing the percentages . #% Once all the rhetoric is cut out , it is just as simple as that . #% But now the industry has to demonstrate that it has a realistic timetable for developing alternative tests . #% Those clients may be involved in all sorts of dodgy transactions . #% 
It is crazy for us to be obliged to undergo this ponderous and protracted Treaty revision procedure when we wish merely to reform a common policy . #% Imagine our horror , therefore , when we discovered that Augustine Chihuri , the Zimbabwe police chief who is actually named on the European Union 's prescribed list as being banned from travelling to EU countries , was nevertheless in France last week , at an Interpol meeting in Lyon . #% We are tired of waiting on this issue . #% Secondly , I would like to join with what our colleagues and in particular Mr Titley have said so far about foreign affairs expenditure . #% Once mutation into high pathogenic has occurred , the virus is extremely difficult to control . #% We stressed that there is a need for the three institutions to get together as soon as possible to start talking about the margins - especially in Category 5 , but we have to start looking at Categories 3 and 4 as well . #% Some organisations publish details of Members ' attendances ; however this is a classic example of how sometimes when they say that Members have not attended the plenary part-sessions it is simply that they have not signed in in the Chamber on that day . #% How the present Union responds and adapts to facilitate this expansion , enabling the applicant states to develop and strengthen their newly established or re-established democratic institutions and economic transformation , will be the benchmark by which the history of this and the next decade in Europe will be judged . #% I have described our Legal Service as all sorts of things but that has not entered the vocabulary . #% Madam President , I should like to thank the services for the third attempt at minuting accurately what I have been saying day after day in this Chamber about the lack of a danger to health from using nickel in the new Euro coins . #% We must do all in our power to encourage and support reform , including especially basic legal safeguards for freedom of expression as required by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Iran is a signatory . #% In my own country , the United Kingdom , the small business population has actually increased in size by one half since 1980 and there is now one small business for every 13 adults in the population . #% That would run completely counter to the notion of a single market and the mutual importance of fostering and nurturing small businesses within that market . #% In an increasingly interdependent world , where the globe 's economy is seamlessly linking together , the single greatest economic challenge we face in Europe -- a challenge which we lose at our peril - is global competitiveness . #% I recently went to a conference of construction equipment manufacturers . #% I attended that hearing on both days . #% Despite an absolutely resounding rejection just last June in the European Parliament elections of the remoteness and secrecy of our institutions collectively , that first step next week will be adding to the democratic deficit in that Parliament will be excluded and there seems to be no good reason for this . #% We should take care to look at the cost of this . #% Commissioner Barnier , you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe . #% We should look for new ways of cooperation . #% Yes , eight Member States have banned phthalates , but when the Commissioner replies , can he tell us whether those eight Member States have supplied the Commission with the scientific evidence that they based their ban on ? #% How are we going to cope if we do not really reform the common agricultural policy in Commissioner Fischler 's mind when we come to discuss the WTO negotiations ? #% It certainly delivered on this . #% I am sure that is a view shared by most of the Member States . #% We want high standards . #% Mr President , I wish to inform the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that I was very interested to read a paragraph in the conclusions adopted by the General Affairs Council last week that stated that there was strong commitment to the needs of developing countries , and in particular the LDCs , and that the Council supported an ambitious development programme in Hong Kong . #% This resolution further calls on the President and his government to take action on other issues . #% A doubling sounds very good , but we are starting from an extremely low base . #% The original EC Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments of 1968 was an important landmark in this field of international private law , marking a departure from a previous patchwork of mainly bilateral treaties between various countries . #% I very much welcome the Commissioner 's remarks and the fact that he says the Commission is doing everything possible to lessen the number of unsafe abortions taking place in the world , and indeed to reduce the need for abortions by giving and encouraging access to family planning and reproductive health matters . #% The Commission can not pick and choose the hierarchy of articles in this respect . #% I wish that other British Members would stop the cheap politics that we are seeing this week in this House . #% I also believe that people in the civil service should win promotion because of their ability , not because of their political allegiance . #% We should note that flax and hemp are environmentally-friendly crops . #% Europhiles have been complaining that the British people will not be properly informed about the EU Constitution . #% The European institutions have to be economically serious about encouraging local slaughter by removing those export subsidies . #% But the Commission 's subsequent work has proved my view to be correct : amongst the international community blocs claiming to be able to rebuild nations , the European Union is standing alone . #% Only when UK health officials intervened was the problem finally resolved . #% We do not want to see legislation on the environment that undermines higher standards in those Member States that choose to have them . #% I will return to that in a moment . #% Finally , it is deeply regrettable that President Kirchner in Argentina has chosen to divert attention away from domestic politics and her poor performance as president by employing bellicose language over the Falkland Islands , whose inhabitants wish to remain British . #% That is not an excuse , it is not an evasion . #% With the suggested improvements that have come forward from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , this scheme could improve both the mobility of apprentices and the quality of work-linked training received by apprentices and therefore make a contribution towards raising skills levels in the EU . #% It is because the procedures are complicated , because they are being evaded . #% As a member of the Committee on Petitions , it is clear to me that there is a considerable and growing number of residents , including third-country nationals and frontier workers , for whom the current arrangements are not working satisfactorily . #% Finally , through this Chamber I wish to make a plea to Postcomm , the British postal regulator . #% I feel a special responsibility to ensure that we do not forget that and ensure that this directive continues to develop in a positive way for the environment . #% Yet members of both the Hindu and Muslim communities in India died in the attack and worked together in the rescue efforts . #% We now have a sensible directive to protect workers such as welders from artificial radiation . #% The cost of compensation and assistance is expected to be so excessive that it would prejudice the economic viability of the service , which might have to be discontinued . #% Mr President , I would like , as others have done , to congratulate the rapporteur Mr B√∂ge on his work . #% This most recent outburst of violence in the Nigerian state of Plateau is particularly troubling as not only has the violence been horrendous , but also there is evidence that Islamist extremists have been recruited from neighbouring Muslim countries , such as Chad and Niger , possibly with international Islamic terrorist connections . #% That is why I am disappointed to hear what the presidency said about the intention to continue with the work of the Western European Armaments Group . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , it has always been my contention that , far from encouraging competition , the EU in its drive for the mythical ` level playing field ' wants to stamp it out altogether . #% I would like Mr Kinnock to elaborate on his last answer and just to confirm , in the light of the very extensive organisational reforms , and all that is implied in some of the changes of responsibility , out-sourcing , and the new technology , whether he is really satisfied that the Berlaymont is going to be the appropriate home for the new re-focused Commission . #% Unless we in the European Union grasp the nettle now , we will fall even further behind , to the extent that we may never catch up . #% I gather it may well be withdrawn and I would welcome that . #% Madam President , after the daylight drama that we had in Mr Cabrol 's last report on the tobacco advertising ban , it is sad to be back to the late shift for health workers in this Parliament tonight . #% I was delighted to hear the Commissioner say that 50 % of farmers are over 55 . #% I conclude by saying with a certain mischievous glee , as someone who has campaigned for better recycling in my own country for 30 years , that I rather hope that this directive puts a bomb under my own local authorities and recalcitrant government . #% The Bulgarian authorities undertook to bring about radical improvement . #% I share the concerns expressed about the funding - for which this Parliament has part of the responsibility - for the ESFA , at long last to set forth in an effective manner . #% I have endeavoured to be open about this and I know that the Socialist Group has had concerns . #% This would be a very important signal to the people of Bulgaria and a reminder that they are not forgotten at a time when ten other countries will have just acceded to the European Union . #% Mr President , in his introduction Mr Schwaiger says that the goal of the World Trade Organisation is free trade . #% Yet that message does not seem to get through to them on a day-to-day basis and we have to ask why . #% 
If we walk away from the issue and do not make European industry competitive we will continue to have this sort of problem . #% It is imperative that individual Member States take more preventive action to stop these deliberate acts from re-occurring . #% The Commission statement and our debate today highlight a very important problem that the whole world - indeed mankind globally - should take an interest in . #% Please , please , give us Tony Blair as the first President of Europe . #% We heard in the last debate about water . #% A new ERM is essential but should not be a prerequisite to moving to stage 3 . #% These amendments go well beyond the Commission 's original objectives in bringing forward this proposal , and there are no grounds for suggesting that the levels of protection in the original Directive are inadequate . #% I congratulate both the draftsperson Mr Harrison and the rapporteur Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn for getting to grips with these highly technical and complex matters . #% Mr President , flexibility is the name of the game in political and economic systems these days and I think that Mr Crowley 's report is to be welcomed because it is a contribution to this flexibility . #% I believe changes in European and American trade policies are likely to prove of greater benefit to developing nations , and I have fears that we could be making mistakes that will have unforeseen consequences for our environment . #% To look at the problems that are raised , for example , by the distant selling of car insurance . #% Bond yields in Portugal rose to nearly 7 % yesterday . #% In Brandenburg , where the great bustard population had fallen from 4 000 in the 1930s to a few hundred , 9 500 hectares of monoculture have transformed its prospects and also brought economic benefit to an economically depressed area . #% That is the future of the European chemical industry , not deregulation , and not an approach to competition which means cheapest is best . #% I would like particularly to thank our rapporteur who has done excellent work on this . #% This afternoon we expect an extremely strong commitment from the Council that we will see , in particular with the broad economic guidelines , proper measures to tackle unemployment in Europe . #% The Slovak government must show that it is truly committed to a pluralist democracy . #% It is easy to forget the speed with which Europe has moved on from those dark days and what life was like for those under the yoke of Communist tyranny . #% We have to keep the pressure on . #% This , Madam President , is the hypocrisy of the left . #% I know and deeply respect the fact that many would like a separate rule , but it should not be a rule just for the sake of a headline . #% That is clearly ridiculous . #% There was nothing quite so preposterous as to see this Parliament debating time after time reports on reports , especially , for example , the report that comes every year from the Committee on Institutional Affairs - usually with Mr Valverde L√≥pez as rapporteur - where Parliament receives the annual reports on European Union from the European Council . #% I hope that improved relations between the EU and North Africa may result from the Mediterranean programme . #% His implication that NATO was no longer the pre-eminent vehicle for military defence is an issue which I feel needs to be further examined and about which I am concerned . #% Whilst welcoming the animal welfare aspect of this proposal , I agree with Mrs Kla√ü that maybe we are rushing a little and we need time to look at every aspect of this rather complex deal . #% There is evidence also of this Fifth Brigade being involved in pre-election crackdowns . #% Can the Presidentin-Office , during his term of office , ensure that Ecofin , particularly in the context of the stability pact , makes the distinction between borrowing for investment , which surely must be acceptable under carefully defined circumstances , and borrowing for current expenditure ? #% Mr President , do not misunderstand me , I am not against people going on holiday ; it is just that , normally , we have to pay for it ourselves . #% The UK , as an island , is especially vulnerable , and the history of our coastline is littered with horrific accidents and disasters not dissimilar to the . #% In particular , we are concerned that by including some 22 offences in the scope of the Arrest Warrant , this measures goes further than is necessary in tackling the immediate terrorist threat . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - I just wish to inform the House that the compromise package of amendments , which is in the first block , and amendment 15 represent a hard-negotiated compromise with the Council and the Commission . #% It therefore means that on some occasions it is quite probable that the activities to secure decontamination and protection for public health are not as extensive as , ideally , we would like them to be . #% A policy strategy that fails to address the principal political blockage in front of the Union should be assessed fairly critically . #% Mr President , as masses of people demonstrate about the situation in Africa , the G8 leaders are meeting in Scotland . #% Secondly ; does he feel that there is a need for some independent assessment ? #% Might I say too , in terms of the general debate , that the communication of the Commission has indeed laid down four major principles for the Agenda of the round which we fully support in my Group . #% The Conservative Party is fighting hard to attack fraud within the EU but we can not support this report because of its references to a European Public Prosecutor , which we believe is an incursion on national sovereignty in the area of criminal justice . #% Although the report does not concern the public 's right of access to the institutions ' documents , the Commission text seems to introduce a new and ill-defined exception to access to documents , namely `` interests of the Union '' , which could negatively affect the Parliament 's right to documents . #% We expect you to stick to the brief or to come back and tell us something different . #% I hope that the Commission will examine this area carefully . #% The process for reaching a compromise has been very useful and speedy . #% In the commercial sector , just-in-time delivery systems -- the backbone of modern industrial supply -- will also be jeopardised due to the lack of drivers . #% When the bell rang - and I did hear it in my office - I looked to the screen to see what was happening . #% I thank the Commissioner for his reply but I have to say that farmers in my constituency say to me they have grave doubts about the validity of statistics in other countries of the European Union which are very low compared with the United Kingdom . #% In the Middle East access to the Jordan River is one of the key aspects of the Middle East Peace process , in particular in relation to the Golan Heights . #% We are particularly concerned about the effect that these measures would have on minibuses operated by the voluntary and non-commercial sectors . #% Companies are constantly complaining to me and I know they complained to the Commissioner when he was kind enough to come to my constituency . #% The Commission ' s original intention was to present a proposal for a scaffolding directive . #% When we talk of humanitarian aid , I am reminded of when I was in Addis Ababa before the fall of Mengistu regime . #% We must all share in the fight against fraud wherever it occurs . #% Secondly , we call for the nomination of the Iraqi marshlands - drained down to the last 10 % now - as a world heritage site . #% Gaza represents one of the most scarred and desolate corners of the world . #% This is just one of the reasons why I would like to give wholehearted support to the first indent of paragraph 14 . #% Mr President , Cuba has regrettably failed to make any progress on human rights in the past year , indeed , since I last spoke on the subject . #% After all , they have the most to lose if their forests are removed . #% I would hope to see such legislation coming forward from the Commission . #% I want to briefly pick up on some of the crucial points that he made . #% Mr President , as a supplementary , is the presidency concerned about the fact that there are so many power stations , particularly around the North Sea and in the north of Europe , where , when water is sucked in to cool the power station , vast numbers , literally billions , of tiny floating creatures that would turn into fish are destroyed . #% Fourthly , we want a further look at the flexibility clauses so that certain Member States are able in practice to deepen their relationship without threatening the acquis . #% They called for impact studies to come into force before the directive itself can take effect or all manner of additional labelling over and beyond the double labelling on the packet which is provided here for the consumers . #% Overall , we have had very good cooperation with the Danish Presidency on this dossier - to such an extent that we feel we can reach agreement at second reading with the assurances we now have from COREPER that the Council will be willing to accept these three amendments adopted in the Employment Committee . #% I must add one last point : selling China arms to balance our trade deficit is not the answer . #% Chirac should realise that making the EU a rival of the US is a no-brainer . #% In particular , there are certain elements of the way in which cement kilns are used for waste disposal , particularly hazardous waste disposal , that need to be examined . #% I would like us to focus on delivery for our citizens , because that is what the European Union will be judged on . #% 
It is certainly the view of my group that such services should not be included . #% I would like to read clause 3 in full , to show that this is not a final decision , but simply open-mindedness with a view to keeping this matter under review . #% Why are no-smoking areas not enforced ? #% Hence the reason for my abstention on all the final votes . #% Mr President , this week we have debated the issue of better regulation . #% And does Europe really apply human rights consistently when it fails to support criticisms of the abuse in both China and Russia , but is prepared to do so for less strategically important countries like Nepal or North Korea ? #% They all publish forecasts , they all give information about the nature of the debate within their governing councils . #% We protect our own agricultural community in Europe at the cost of other countries . #% We also support the call for a regulatory cost-impact assessment by the Commission and by Parliament for its amendments . #% We talk about relations with Moldova , for example . #% While we are trying to achieve concentration , will she accept that in this very fractional , peripheral part of the structural funds there is some merit in keeping a programme which provides very small amounts of money to large numbers of authorities that otherwise just would not get involved ? #% We want - and I say this directly to you , Commissioner - those countries that have not yet ratified that convention , to ratify it ; they include Greece , Ireland , Italy , Malta and Slovenia . #% Mr President , I voted against Amendment No 54 which would have allowed a derogation from our yield limits on cigarettes exported to third countries . #% We should let the Hamas and Hizbollah ministers in question renounce their intentions to drive the Israelis into the sea before we consider sending their governments aid . #% It is important to note that the amount of uranium that could be dissolved is very small compared to the natural abundance of uranium in all sea-water . #% It is important to make distinctions , and here we see companies in the areas of hi-tech , drugs , and biotechnology being made to jump through hoops which may have to be reconsidered . #% Precision Components in Benfleet , a small engineering company , started by the owner 's father from a garage and still present on the same site were enabled to invest in new equipment for the first time in four years . #% I commend especially paragraph 9 of the report , which invites the Bureau to set up a system of legislative footprints whereby rapporteurs can record those that have lobbied in the course of progressing a draft law . #% I think the Commissioner is right at this stage that it should be a recommendation . #% I should like to ask you , if you have not already done so , to write to the President of the United States , Mr Bush , to ask that the death sentence against Tim McVeigh , the extreme right-wing terrorist bomber in Oklahoma , be commuted to life imprisonment . #% You can not simply rely on a trickle down from growth in the economy . #% This manifests itself when you examine key legislation and , in particular , the implementation of such legislation in international law , which has been at best patchy and at worst downright protectionist . #% One in three of us will during our lifetime . #% The report of my gallant friend , General Morillon , exposes very clearly the ambition to communitarise defence within the European Union . #% The Commission should be looking at far-reaching proposals , such as proposals that would in general allow a least-developed country export to qualify for duty-free access to the EU if at least 40 % of a good 's value is added in a least-developed country that is not necessarily the final country of export . #% Is the SANCO DG under pressure from other directorates ? #% But in three countries , Denmark , Sweden and Great Britain , the euro decision is not yet made . #% Attempts by Eurosceptics and assorted nationalists on the extreme right to set the national parliaments and the European Parliament against each other must be resisted . #% No woman is ` just ' anything . #% Whilst we acknowledge that work needs to be done in this area , we believe this is an issue for nation states to legislate upon . #% Mr Corbett and Mr M√©ndez de Vigo have done an excellent job in their clear and straightforward explanation and advocacy of its merits . #% Whereas there is a great deal of logic in some of the provisions of the directive - for example , the simplified procedure for some less dangerous substances which are better known , less toxic and pose no serious risk - one has to be sure that these procedures are not abused to the disadvantage of the environment and public health . #% Would the President-in-Office like to comment on the fact that even if it were not for the single currency there was a need for consolidation of the European economies , given the fact that we are now competing in a global environment , in particular in those countries which have weaker economies and could be most at risk as a result of globalization ? #% I apologise , on behalf of the United Kingdom , that it has not been up to speed with other countries in these renewable energy , heating and cooling measures . #% We are very fortunate to get something like half of 1 % of the budget and I only get one minute to present our concerns . #% The obvious answer is ` very easily ' : it has been doing it for years . #% I welcome this proposal . #% They seem to be more concerned about protecting political friends than protecting the people of Europe . #% Now with the Treaty of Amsterdam we have moved over to codecision and we are having a second reading here today . #% Finally , 13 years after creating the single market , it is time we accepted that there is a European single market which demands European champions , not national champions . #% The President of the Court of Auditors has admitted that there are serious ongoing problems : every annual report spells them out , page after page , and nothing much actually happens as a result . #% It would be far better if those three words were deleted and if the rapporteur could take that on board . #% One key area of concern for these Southern African Customs Union ( SACU ) countries is the loss of customs revenue , as Mrs Kinnock has said . #% A quick word about each of those amendments : Article 3 ( 3 ) of the proposal derogates from important elements of the directive in respect of workers whose exposure is of a sporadic and low intensity . #% I live with diabetes . #% With regard to the point about shared management , which has been raised by others , it seems to me that , in this case , shared management is turning out to be no management at all . #% The Council presidency and the Commission have issued a joint statement with Norway , the United States and Japan expressing our common concern that recent developments in Sri Lanka may jeopardise the spirit of cohabitation between the President and the government , which has proved vital to efforts to sustain the momentum of the peace process . #% Since the European Parliament is the European institution closest to European citizens , it would make sense for it to become the institution around which this information campaign revolves . #% So we parliamentarians had better get it right when we help to confirm the choice of Europe 's bank boss , especially when we hold the unique inquisitorial hearings in Parliament in Brussels in May . #% It is estimated that three million Fair Trade hot drinks are consumed in the UK each day . #% paragraphs 10 and 19 - we believe that conventional forces alone can not ensure credible deterrence , that nuclear weapons make a unique contribution in rendering the risks of aggression against the UK and its allies incalculable and unacceptable and consequently that they remain essential to preserving peace ; #% - This motion for a resolution calls , inter alia , for a kerosene tax and for kilometre charges for motor cars . #% We in the animal welfare and conservation movements welcome the late conversion of British Conservatives to the side of animal welfare in this regard . #% In this way , the statistics collected can be a useful tool for supporting the decision maker in the tourism industry . #% We do not want that to happen again because an outside agency such as the United States has seemingly broken WTO rules , especially since the US itself should restructure old plants , rationalise employment and pension practices so that its own industry is improved , but not at the expense of European industry . #% Most of the people in the committee believe that it is imperative and legitimate that Community provisions having the same objective should be subject to the same legislative procedure , namely that which is laid down in Article 189 of the EC Treaty . #% As a democratic institution one has to say that it is nothing more than a sham . #% He proclaimed that ` we must reject forced liberalisation ' , and yet the Commission is adopting an increasingly aggressive negotiating agenda that is diametrically opposed to this . #% It is a very important report that gives us the opportunity not only to look at the operation of the Customs Union but to give some preliminary reflections on the future direction of relations with Turkey , in anticipation of Mr Swodoba 's report which hopefully we will have before the end of the year . #% Mr President , I wish to bring to the House 's attention the situation concerning a local councillor in Lancaster in the UK , who made public a decision made in secret by the cabinet of the City Council to suspend the local taxation owed to it by the local nuclear power station owned by British Energy . #% In category 5 last year , EUR 70 million was underspent . #% Secondly , the specific inclusion of housing , health and other public authority functions , including policing . #% Town planning is a field that needs to remain at local level in order for the needs of local areas to fall on understanding ears . #% However , it is important that it should be taken seriously . #% For this reason , we voted in favour of this resolution . #% We become more vulnerable . #% 
As others have said , the ceiling on category 4 has been a problem ever since we concluded the interinstitutional agreement . #% By thrashing out a project here in this House -- which represents the full spectrum of public opinion in Europe -- a compromise acceptable to such a wide majority , we were able to set in motion a process which has taken us to where we are today and where the draft Constitution will be the crowning glory of Spinelli 's efforts . #% We see it too in the individual delegations and missions , where we find suspicion and hostility between embassies and between delegations of the European Commission . #% I would like to see a much greater investment insofar as human resources development for the young is concerned . #% Now I understand that the provost of Columbia University in New York has issued instructions on how he would like graduate teachers dealt with and punished . #% It is essential that this trend is reversed and that adequate resources are allocated to this policy area within the Commission . #% That is why the ELDR Group hopes that the Commission , the Council and this Parliament will embark on a proactive attempt to remake the political case for further trade liberalisation in general and for a new comprehensive round , rather than an intermediate round , in particular . #% Radio news broadcasts have been shut down , foreign news channels taken off air and local media barred from publishing news or commentary without prior approval . #% More than 69 000 new cases are diagnosed in the UK each year and over 2 000 people die each year in the UK from skin cancer . #% The Commission now judges that the current regime is in compliance . #% Nevertheless , now that the matter is on the agenda , we will vote in favour of the resolution , of course , but maybe in future we can focus on those countries around the world where the carrying out of death sentences is virtually or actually a daily event . #% I am very grateful that you recognise the urgency of this problem because with open borders across the Union , organised crime is free to operate and to prosper , while our police forces are national and can not cross the frontiers . #% Firstly , would existing successful arrangements for dealing with electronic waste be allowed to continue ? #% Third : When does he expect the matter to be finally and satisfactorily resolved ? #% Not enough publicity is being given to this foul trade . #% Only those organizations which meet the criteria originally laid down by the Commission can expect to be involved . #% We would have preferred beneficiaries of subsidiary protection to stay in as a matter of principle , because they are long-term legal residents , but we decided to assist the passage of the report . #% People in Zimbabwe are afraid . #% The EU did not offer to pay the difference . #% Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention . #% This shabby fix is the opposite of what the European Union should stand for . #% Mr President , can I first of all say that I am rather surprised that this debate is entitled air attacks against Iraq . #% I hope that , in December , we will have achieved some of those political priorities . #% I want to insert the words ` after the Kyoto conference ' following the opening phrase which says ` Calls on the European Union ' to convert the Commission 's recent communication into a binding commitment in order to give substance to our commitment . #% In October 2006 the Commission produced an action plan for energy efficiency , proposing a 20 % improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 and setting out 10 priority areas for action . #% On a slightly wider point , I visited , albeit a year or so ago , Bratislava and Kosice with a parliament delegation and we looked at the conditions of the Roma people there . #% Mr President , it is nothing short of a tragedy that the Commission proposal before us is not proposing an end to the long-distance transport of farm animals and a ban on live exports . #% These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us . #% If you look at yesterday 's minutes , you will see that under Item 5 it says that ` the sitting was suspended at 11.30 awaiting voting time and resumed at 12.00 ' . #% This needs to be considered by the Commission in particular if we are to look towards a satisfactory human rights situation in Europe as a whole . #% But let us hope that those good relationships can continue as we go into the next conciliation , prior to the second reading by the Council . #% It should be honest and say that , like us , it has always supported a social market economy . #% Will the President please write to the British Government to clarify how this sits with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , especially Article 14 ( 3 ) , the right to education , which I believe specifically covers Lucy Payne 's case and the concerns of many other parents across Northamptonshire . #% The Commission admits that people tend to see the Community legal framework as being excessively complex and unclear and proposes that it be simplified . #% The amendment adopted -- however much I deplore it -- was only an amendment to a recital in which we refer to a past resolution having regard to it . #% I fear we are going to repeat that error in another report later this week . #% Could you ensure that everyone who is entitled to a written answer gets it please ? #% Against this background , I am shocked , President Barroso , at the frontal attack by the Commission on social Europe and the interference with national labour markets , as in the case of Ireland . #% The Commission has got enough serious work to do without having to try to take over the responsibility of national police and national enforcing bodies . #% Far too often funds are held up and NGOs run into difficulties because of the delays in getting funds released . #% I suspect that there is already less temptation to this practice in those fisheries where days at sea are limited . #% It is equally clear that Europe does not have the resources for a European defence identity : we can not mount a campaign without American and NATO support . #% Having said that , we must be aware that , if there is military intervention in Kosovo , it will mean NATO declaring war on a European state . #% This is simply a democratic government expressing the will of its people . #% Hence there need to be some radical changes to the proposals where they relate to the reporting of financial information by journalists . #% I would advocate that way forward . #% I find myself totally supportive of this motion in addressing the information deficit of the EU . #% Mr President , President Barroso said that we should not start the blame game . #% That discrimination is contrary to the principles of the Treaty of Rome and the principles of a single market . #% Its response was entitled ` A war on terrorism ' -- a highly dubious military proposition . #% On Iraq , what was missing from the Summit conclusions was a reference to preserving the devolved administration of the Kurds in the north . #% Although this process involves some initial filtration , there is no way that one could describe this discharge as sterile : it contains pathogens of all sorts . #% The 10th anniversary of the beginning of it all , with the removal of autonomy from Kosovo , has to be the year in which it finishes . #% While peak exceedances are falling across Europe , the average level is continuing to rise , almost certainly as a result of pollution generated far from our shores . #% It is charging farmers a global warming levy on their electricity bills , whilst those same farmers have lost thousands of tons of sugar beet and potatoes in the ground due to very cold weather . #% The report , if adopted , would lead to further initiatives and pressure to press on with the Lisbon agenda . #% This report takes us a positive step forward and shows Parliament at its best as a defender of the public interest . #% As well as in the European Parliament , Fair Trade products are available in many Council buildings , tea and coffee served at meetings is Fair Trade and awareness days have been held to inform staff about the benefits of Fair Trade . #% This point was itself made to me by candidate Duisenberg last week in the European Parliament 's monetary sub-committee and this committee , too , must adopt and adapt . #% We should look at making our systems more employment-friendly and seek to eliminate barriers to moving from benefits to work . #% In those and other efforts , by working with people of all ethnic backgrounds we are for them and also working for the purposes and values that bind us together . #% I would ask the Council if Article 7 ( 3 ) , means that non-EU members can participate in EU activities and decision-making . #% And my second point : we talk about the dignity of Parliament . #% That has been the subject of debate in our political groups . #% It may have been a compromise between the ELDR and the EPP Groups , but it was not a compromise which we signed . #% I suggest that the House might like to read what I said , because I think they will agree with me and not with Mr Gollnisch . #% 
According to the Minutes : ' the President suggested Mr Hallam write to the Speaker of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives asking for an explanation of this matter ' . #% A large number of amendments tabled to the reports we are discussing today sadly demonstrate that some political groups in this House are more interested in short-term political advantage in the run-up to the European elections , than in achieving realistic reforms to create an agriculture policy appropriate for a Europe of 20 to 25 countries in the 21st century , operating in a global economy and subject to World Trade Organisation rules . #% Let us also be morally consistent . #% But make no mistake : the real agenda of this proposal is further political integration . #% Others have already made extensive inquiries in the UK and another , even more in-depth inquiry is due from the British Parliamentary Ombudsman in November 2006 . #% Such a moratorium could place our forces at a potential disadvantage and thereby potentially endanger more lives than the NATO forces . #% This is why we have had to make a few amendments to the common position . #% I have said for years , ` be careful what you wish for ' . #% Some countries which talk hawkishly are not prepared to support their words with actions . #% I welcome the comments of the President-in-Office . #% The bulk of the amendments moved by the rapporteur do , within that margin , improve this directive . #% Let us hope that Macedonia has indeed turned a corner and that the Ohrid Agreement will be fully implemented . #% As a pro-European , I think it very sad that we have had to waste time blocking ludicrous proposals like this . #% I call on the Sri Lankan Government , for instance , to investigate fully and to prosecute cases of extra-judicial killing . #% I just want to sound the slight warning note that we must respect subsidiarity and national competences in this area and in this process . #% As I understand it , we still have no formal declaration , no common position , and no joint action . #% The same should naturally apply to fisheries products . #% I fear a long postponement will allow it to wriggle round those limits . #% In the UK , tax takes 75 % or three-quarters of the price of a litre of petrol or diesel and that is the responsibility of the government , no one else . #% Other colleagues have referred to the issue of fingerprinting 14-year-olds , which has been very sensitive and very emotive . #% As my neighbour , Mrs Macovei of the EPP , has said , people-to-people direct contacts create trust . #% However , due to time constraints here , I am unable to elaborate on the mechanisms of doing that , but you are welcome to talk to me afterwards . #% With the tensions that we have in the Middle East at the moment , it is essential for us to maintain those links , especially for the Commissioner who , no doubt , has fallen in love with the Lebanon in the same way as many of us have , and for the Commissioner to be able to use the Lebanon as a bridge through which he can talk to sensible , democratically-minded people in the other countries of the Middle East . #% It is like apple pie and motherhood . #% Therefore it must follow , and I hope the House will agree , that if we are serious about the human rights of men , women and children , then we must have a permanent International Criminal Court to prosecute those who carry out or commission crimes against humanity . #% As Chancellor Brown has just exhorted us , we will conduct purposeful hearings on a quarterly basis with the ECB , not to infringe its executive independence but instead to invoke the necessary public accountability to which even this August and powerful body must submit - it will indeed be ` August ' for the people . #% They will be more horizontal in approach , offering greater added value , and will provide opportunities for the EU and its Member States to work together far more effectively on health issues in the broader sense within the confines of the Treaty . #% Such a move would doubtless mean , for example , that the UK Government , which is currently considering road pricing , would simply have passed the buck for such an unpopular move on to the European Union . #% We have heard again tonight people in this House claiming that we do not need this legislation , that it is about the nanny state . #% Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too . #% The timetable is quite tight , but necessarily so because so much time has already been wasted , and it is going to be 2014 before the cost-optimal methodology will apply . #% She would therefore have been aware of the situation that would result when Ballast Nedam , owned by a Dutch construction company , unceremoniously pulled the plug on the UK subsidiary , leaving some 2000 employees with a grossly under-funded pension fund . #% We have a shared interest in moving the knowledge economy forward . #% The laudable aims in the Laeken Declaration were not then put into practice , and now the Lisbon Agenda faces the same lack of purpose and achievement . #% This process will only be successful , however , if all European citizens are involved and consulted on these essential issues . #% That is the sort of commitment we need if we are going to tackle the demand side of oil dependency , rather than just talk about it . #% We can trust the people of Europe to decide for themselves how they climb ladders . #% Producers in these and other New World countries are not bound by pettifogging bureaucracy that tells them which grapes to grow where and then how to make the wines . #% This is very dangerous and , my friends , this is the way democracy dies . #% The one element that we would have liked to have seen further developed in the overall mix at Barcelona is that of sustainable development . #% The young woman involved lost four years of her life to her employer , who received a nine-month sentence . #% These refugees are alive ; others have been tortured , killed or imprisoned and have no freedom of speech . #% Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London , we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10 % of the lost oil . #% It will be a welcome boost for ports across the European Union . #% Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials . #% They need to have their cases heard properly , they need a fair system and they need a system that puts the individual at the heart of the process . #% Mr President , our ongoing work on working time goes back to the 1993 Directive , which excluded approximately six million workers in total , some 5 million of whom were working in the various transport sectors . #% Clearly we will continue to work in a spirit of constructive consensus but the epicentre of that consensus has moved sharply . #% Please keep your religion out of our lives and please keep it out of politics . #% Aid for trade is necessary to create the conditions and infrastructure to trigger growth , but this aid must be under the control of the recipients themselves to fit within their own national development plans . #% We could support them in another report dealing with those escaping from hunger or environmental disasters . #% No one in this House has ever defended the death penalty . #% The two remaining measures that Parliament is again calling for are a publication of a `` Beige Book '' setting out conditions in each Member State and publication of summary minutes giving the views for and against interest rate changes . #% The problem Britain has is that Margaret Thatcher with the 1984 Fontainebleau Agreement left future British Governments with a poison pill . #% State-controlled media , Commissioner , is refusing to take paid advertising even from the main NGOs who are just working to support the electoral process and democracy in Zimbabwe , or from any opposition parties . #% What you will be doing , however , is sending a message to this Commission and the public who elected us here - you remember them , some of them actually bother to visit us occasionally - that we are steadfastly against waste , fraud and mismanagement ; that we are drawing a line in the sand , that what went before 1999 was completely unacceptable and what happens now and in the future must be better . #% I know , therefore , how important it is to get both the response right and also to protect the general public as far as is possible in a democracy . #% I commend the European Commission for having refused to tie the hands of Member States . #% The issue of recognised partnerships will be discussed at the next meeting of the heads of administration of all EU institutions . #% I believe the Commission appreciates that and will soon bring forward ambitious and practical proposals for the new framework . #% The attitude of many people has been that if we make such heavy weather out of declaring the results of an investigation into what , after all , is a relatively small case , a relatively simple case involving a relatively small amount of money , how can public opinion express confidence that the same institution can deal with much larger sums of money in a much more complex area of policy with much more complex legislative arrangements ? #% An area close to my heart is that of tourism . #% Mrs McCarthy referred to her amendment seeking to enable organisations with a prior title to a name to have a priority period of registration . #% If they wish to continue to trade in the single market , SMEs need to make the conversion very quickly so that their software can handle the euro . #% It is an excellent initiative but it needs more resources and more support . #% I would leave it to my French colleagues to judge whether these people were actually interested in the architecture of the building . #% 
You really ought to get out more , because it seems to me that you are surrounded by Commissioners , officials , sycophants and parliamentarians here , who clearly do not represent the view of at least half the citizens of Europe . #% I think the Commissioner might agree with me that we should be using the most modern methods to communicate to investors . #% The Council should have votes representing the states just as Parliament has a more proportional system representing the population of the European Union . #% Employment is encouraged by removing restraints and scrapping regulations . #% This must be the best chance we have ever had and , on behalf of the ALDE Group , I would like to thank the Luxembourg presidency and you for getting us this far . #% Secondly , I shall not vote for this Commission because I do not believe that in real substance anything has changed in the last few weeks as a result of the hearings which we have had . #% The present EU policy , founded on the issue of who is invited to summer parties -- or not -- does not help Cuba or Europe , and needs to be changed . #% The outcome of this report is a good compromise and one which I hope will command universal support across the House tomorrow . #% It is ever more clear that it is not small farmers ' livelihoods , it is not even the tourist industry and the wider rural economy that the UK has as its priority , but simply our meat exports and the desire to regain FMD-free export status again as soon as possible . #% They have been quite good in the way they have worked with Parliament . #% Another aspect that we looked at was the approval procedure for small series vehicles . #% I welcome , of course , his intention that the Union should listen to the people . #% Our mistake is to perceive Turkey more as a strategic military ally than as a political partner . #% In view of the hesitations in some quarters , not least in some parts of the Council , it is important to stress that the EU is merely drawing out the logic of Member States having given some immigrants a legal right to stay long term . #% The best way to expand ICT in Europe is to let market forces and technology get on with it . #% The quiet Turkish revolution will persist , and we in the Liberal family will see the bigger picture and treat Turkey fairly and recognise what a contribution Turkey can make to the future of Europe . #% Will you write to the appropriate authorities expressing Parliament 's concern that this attempt to bury a problem , rather than to investigate it , is not the way to deal with these issues ? #% As the government of Botswana pointed out in a very well argued paper , numbers have to be managed if the competing demands of people , vegetation and habitats are to be met . #% Mr President , in this brief time I would like to make two points , both in relation to veterinary medicines . #% I use that as a restructuring example , since I live in Northampton , at one time the capital of British shoe-making . #% Let us see after that whether it works or not . #% As I mentioned earlier , the scope of the regulation is limited : it can not answer all questions relating to frontier workers or access to healthcare , particularly when this is currently dealt with under the Treaties as a set of goods and services rather than universal social service . #% In terms of securing competitiveness , we believe in common action to promote maritime training programmes , research and development , and in particular encouraging young people to the profession . #% I think the strength of having all-party support throughout the UK on our delegation was very , very useful . #% We are , however , very wary about the degree of extension that can be accepted even in this case , because of our suspicion of state aids . #% Mr President , I must congratulate the rapporteur for producing what , even by general standards of EU documentation , is 19 pages of the most unreadable , bureaucratic gobbledy-gook , all of which comes under the laughable heading of ` simplification ' of the market in fruit and vegetables ! #% How can I go to my constituents and businesses in my constituency to say that the Commission is going to work on competitiveness and jobs with this set of 96 disconnected proposals ? #% However , I do not agree with one spokesman for WWF , who recently denounced the final outcome of REACH as a disgrace . #% What is your answer to that ? #% He should not be surprised if public reaction in the United Kingdom is hostile . #% The answer is to send a signal at second reading , so that the rapporteur and our colleagues of all parties have the strongest possible negotiating position when we come to one of the most serious processes of conciliation we have ever had in this Parliament . #% Is the Commission considering the introduction of competitive funding mechanisms for the late-stage clinical development of innovative new vaccines that address the neglected diseases , such as TB ? #% Bringing secondary school pupils to this institution for all-expenses-paid visits , during which they will be given disingenuous one-sided briefings about the wonders of the European Union , is a crude brainwashing exercise , as is the flooding of educational establishments with equally one-sided literature . #% That is our duty and responsibility . #% We have drawn from specific best effort and best experience and they are in the joint report . #% It is based on the perception that we adopt legislation in the European Union which is then not implemented universally throughout the Member States of the European Union . #% Their negotiations representing the three elements of the European Union have led to an exemplary performance of the co-decision role . #% There is , however , one detail which seems to have attracted a lot of comments : this is the suggestion that we should have guidelines for written parliamentary questions in the same way that we already have guidelines for questions at Question Time to the other institutions . #% May I also include the 3.5 million Iraqi refugees in the region . #% We looked beyond that and we see the seventh amendment as the last chance . #% Are we really going to say that ? #% One year later we only have a weak Green Paper and no legislation . #% We gave you a brief in March 2000 . #% My group will be supporting the report and , in particular , the amendment by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , which adds to the clarity and certainty of paragraph 7 . #% People who would never have believed themselves capable of elder abuse suddenly find that the explosion has taken place , and that they have struck out and hurt someone they love . #% Secondly -- and this is a lesson that I want to feed back to you from our experience in the West Midlands -- restructuring the supply chain for industries , and particularly the SMEs , was something we started on . #% My group welcomes the Commission 's emphasis on decentralised management and on a reinforced role for the regions . #% It is very important that we give them more than warm words as we enter the new millennium . #% Is the Minister aware that even the authors of this report acknowledge that levels are so low as to be insignificant to health ; that levels are a thousand times less than other radioactive substances naturally present in teeth ; that most of the highest results were recorded over 250 miles from Sellafield ; that this material is more likely to be fallout from weapons testing , which has been present throughout the Northern Hemisphere for some years ; that respected scientific and academic opinion in Northern Ireland -- for which I was the minister responsible for a couple of years -- as well as in his own country , contradicts many of the assertions of the Irish anti-Sellafield lobby ; and that when all is said and done , this is little more than political scaremongering designed to wreck thousands of the jobs of my constituents in north-west England and to damage the livelihoods of those many communities dependent upon this vital and valuable recycling operation ? #% We are looking for something a little more measured . #% Some of these posts are described as jobs , as if there was employment attached . #% author . - Mr President , since the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy and the election of a Maoist-led government in Kathmandu , Nepal and China have inevitably grown much closer . #% I shall look forward to contributing later , but I wanted that on the record now , because it is very important that you as President understand how seriously we regard the way this has been handled . #% Yet it did not consult , it would not listen and it decided to ignore this democratic parliament . #% Is that one of the reasons why we are having to wait longer to get these positive lists of feed materials and the general hygiene rules which follow from the reforms we so enthusiastically greeted last year ? #% Mr President , you exhorted that there should be more women in this Parliament . #% Of course the person did the right thing , he went to his department when he got back to his own country of residence and got reimbursed . #% We must not monitor and prevent it . #% I support the idea of an EU Operational Military Headquarters being established . #% On the basis of the discussions on the last two questions and the fact we are approving the research programme tomorrow - hopefully - I would like to ask the Commissioner a direct question . #% I therefore commend my Amendment No 14 to this House . #% Mr President , throughout this year , as we have gone from the recent G8 Summit to the UN Earth Summit and then on to the negotiations leading up to the conference on climate change in Kyoto , it has become very obvious that there are clear divisions on a global scale with regard to global warming , in particular on the targets to restrain emissions of the main greenhouse gas CO2 . #% Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources . #% If this does not indicate a degree of control then we really have a very serious problem in front of us , something that none of us ever imagined . #% I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his answer . #% Now , the Council at least publishes the results of votes , grants access to most documents and , thanks to the initiative of the UK Presidency last year , deliberates on codecision legislation in public . #% 
That parity of status in a modern economy is extremely important at a time when many people are looking for added value . #% Romania is a model for other countries hoping to reform . #% I had the job two years ago of monitoring how this scheme was operating for the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , and I came to the conclusion that it was a worthwhile scheme and we should continue with it . #% If she thinks that is the kind of behaviour that will reassure people that the Labour Party is ready for government , she has a lot to learn . #% We welcome co-existence rules , which , by allowing GM crops to be grown alongside conventional crops , are another step towards making real consumer choice a reality . #% I think we should recognise that there is now a new democratically-elected government in Indonesia and that , for the first time in 40 years , there is now a civilian defence minister . #% This is a useful product used right across the United Kingdom and Europe for the manufacture of a number of products . #% I should like to make one or two points on the nature of the scourges we face . #% They are allowed one family visit per month . #% Two of them relate to economic and internal market aspects , the third to the justice and policing system , combating organised crime and corruption . #% Sport is now big business . #% That is why it is a good thing to do . #% The British Labour government is carrying out measures to speed up applications for asylum-seekers and is making the system fairer and faster , so that people will be encouraged to make official applications rather than risk their lives on lorries , ships and trains . #% I am sure it will give a lot more transparency and enable a lot more understanding in the long run . #% Madam President , I rise following Mrs Hautala 's statement about Mrs Lucas being imprisoned on her way to the part-session here today . #% There is widespread concern . #% Now , however , every citizen is , potentially , his own bulletin board . #% I am more than happy to provide the full figures in the communication that we gave to Parliament and the Council in October and I will see that they are with the honourable Member before tomorrow evening . #% But efforts to lower the temperature have been impeded by the real crimes against Muslims , not only illegal abduction and detention -- as in Guantanamo Bay , which we will be debating later this week -- but the assaults by occupying forces . #% In this regulation we must avoid giving manufacturers a perverse incentive to simply replace diesel engines with petrol engines in these vehicles , with the resultant increase in C02 emissions that we all want to see avoided . #% I have been unemployed and it is no fun . #% I thought they were sins of omission , but in his opening speech Mr Belder has made it clear that the reason that the one-China policy is not in the report is not because he has forgotten , but he is actually in favour of changing it . #% The broad framework for that is agreed across this House . #% The Prime Minister was right to defend the British rebate . #% I just want to make sure the private sector comes to the party early enough to make sure there is more confidence in the scheme as a whole . #% Our debt to the Mediterranean is not only historical and cultural , it informs our common interest today in enlargement . #% The second is the approach based on emphasising self-regulation as the first resort and , as Mrs Larive said , the addition of further directives only as a last resort . #% What we have done is to draw the logical consequences from that link and incorporate rules on the classification of documents into the regulation itself . #% At this stage there is no need for Parliament to have a resolution . #% I would argue that the major reason for Europe 's importance to young people is precisely because it has a fundamental role to play in the quality of assurance of the first three ` Es ' and also for creating the opportunities of the single market . #% Thank you very much indeed , President-in-Office , for taking note of that particular suggestion . #% Therefore , we are concerned about this view of the Commission 's powers of discretion being extremely wide and would prefer to have them described as providing a certain margin of appreciation . #% It was wrong of the Commission to exclude environmental authorities from participating in decision-making . #% However , we must acknowledge that we need to focus ever more upon the implementation of both the economic guidelines and in particular , perhaps , the employment guidelines . #% The risk of exaggerated claims of miracle cures , of weakening of standards and of insufficient regulation is arguably real although international bodies which are strong in , for example , the field of homeopathy , have worked very hard to raise awareness and standards . #% I am therefore slightly surprised at the negative text of the resolution we have before us and at some of the contributions to the debate , because the General Affairs Council surely produced a very good outcome - European solidarity was confirmed . #% I would particularly like to welcome and draw attention to the statement in the common position . #% The primary instrument of this policy is ESDP which otherwise sensible European states have been hoodwinked into supporting . #% I was the person who raised an objection to dealing with a matter of substance by way of a corrigendum . #% Now , I personally own over 4 000 books , and , although this is hardly a knowledge revolution in itself , it is some indication , on a personal level extrapolated to a political level , of the pace of change in how knowledge is accessed , distributed , applied and refined . #% Each year American congressmen are allowed to send four four-sided newspapers to every single one of their voters to tell them of their glorious achievements . #% Fisherman who catch herring for human consumption are finding fewer and smaller fish . #% This report points up crucial areas for action and I hope this Parliament , by supporting the report , will make a major contribution to the modernization of social protection systems that demonstrate our solidarity as Europeans . #% With economic liberalisation , India offers a growing market for EU businesses . #% Madam President , we welcome this initiative as another small step along the road towards fulfilling the Tampere mandate to make the principle of mutual recognition the cornerstone of judicial cooperation . #% I very much hope that Commissioner De Gucht will reflect its recommendations in the new trade policy communication . #% Our response to the terrorist threat must be intelligence led and , therefore , requires the contribution of the very communities that these policies are pushing to the fringes of society . #% Progress in this area can not be made overnight and in the meantime the interests of desperate people , understandably fleeing from conflict , persecution or other hardship , are not well served by pushing them into the hands of the unscrupulous and the criminals ; those who seek to make a living out of trafficking people . #% Given the policy of the ICRC not to reveal the detention conditions of those that it visits , Aung San Suu Kyi should also be seen by Italian Ambassador Miniero , on behalf of the European Union , or by Her Majesty 's Ambassador to Burma , Vicky Bowman . #% Madam President , I congratulate Mrs Kauppi on this report . #% However , in the programme connected with this visit the group is described as a delegation and in particular Mr Goodwill , MEP , is described as leader of the delegation . #% Mr President , I wondered why Mr Fatuzzo has nothing to say on this . #% We are aware that Pakistan is a new democracy , that it is facing conflict on its borders , and that it has faced the disaster of the recent flood , as well as the earthquake only this week . #% We need it now . #% I thank the Commissioner for intervening in this particular crisis and for responding positively to requests from myself and others . #% Again we think this is perfectly reasonable , when your life is effectively in not just the pilot 's hands but also in the hands of the cabin crews . #% We have heard this so often , but often been disappointed . #% I hope the fact that we have signed up to this bilateral deal with the Chinese does not leave them thinking that we are going to be any more forgiving on human rights . #% We rightly fund democratic institutions in Palestine , yet we impede the right to self determination of the people annexed in East Jerusalem . #% It clearly demonstrates the Commission 's contempt for this Parliament , for democracy and for the people that ultimately have to underwrite the Eurostat corruption , by which I mean the taxpayers of Europe . #% He has been detained since 29 March 1995 , for over 15 months , without charge or without trial . #% Many of us do not support the abolition of capital punishment in principle . #% I am horrified by the scale of this sickening trade every year . #% None of us should make any apologies for how we came to be in this place today . #% I should declare an interest : my stepson is a truck driver and he and his colleagues are aghast at these proposals . #% One of the reasons for the failure of the Canc√∫n debate was its use and misuse , for example by NGOs . #% 
On 15 November , I brought to your attention the plight of the plane spotters arrested in Greece , amongst them my constituents Lesley and Paul Coppin . #% However , time must be allowed for sugar production in the EU , ACP and LDCs to adapt to an open market situation . #% Are there any issues at which most Members of the European Parliament will not try to throw taxpayers ' money ? #% With that history , it takes time to regain trust , and lack of trust contributed to why , in the recent troubles , Member States had to put a lot of cash on the table . #% Exploring these regulations and their proposed amendments , it is clear that the underlying ethos is the control of corporate business , itself a reasonable objective in a sector which has had more than its fair share of problems . #% That is an extremely useful definition . #% Those chemicals called endocrine disrupters - not endocrine modulators , as some would have them known - are present in many different plastics and many other products including food wrappers , paints and pesticides . #% I wonder if we should transfer some of the cash to overcrowded schools in other places . #% I take the Commissioner ' s point about subsidiarity but what we are arguing for in Parliament is a minimum framework directive which does not invade subsidiarity and which solves the problem by creating an obligation on the Member States to set up an inspectorate within certain broad guidelines . #% I will therefore be voting against this regulation . #% All this illustrates the importance of Parliament 's work . #% Global warming pushes us away from conventional power , while safety and security concerns threaten nuclear power . #% For example , if we look at the Caspian Sea region , we find that it has tremendous oil potential leading potentially to great prosperity . #% I am grateful for the active cooperation of the Commissioner 's services , but the results of my questionnaire - showing that non-state actor consultation took place in only half of 63 beneficiary countries and that the totals by region record only 2 or 3 % of the total funding provided going to non-state actors - represents a challenge for the time ahead . #% But unfortunately , as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber , human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world . #% What is the European Parliament for ? #% My biggest concern at the moment is that we have an increasing number of Member States who are simply failing to comply even with the legislation we already have on the statute books . #% Lorry traffic on EU roads is growing both in numbers and in size and we think there are three reasons why this proposal is so important . #% Regarding a pause in financial services liberalisation , there is a difference between the financial crisis , seen globally , and bad lending and bad debts . #% Secondly , we need a proper mechanism for day-to-day decision-making in foreign policy . #% If countries wish to include it voluntarily that is a matter for them . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on putting together a proposal which is generally uncontentious among the 15 Member States and on all sides of this Parliament . #% We are in danger of being left behind as a semi-detached part of the Union . #% So I am very pleased to see the Commission taking the Parliament 's initiative so seriously , and that is a very positive point to start with . #% If he is going to reply to this debate , Mr Solana might like to address that point . #% I wanted to focus in particular on the General Affairs Council . #% The previous speaker , from my own country - we at least carry the same passport , though we have different views - referred to the situation in the UK . #% Maybe , if we vote for this tomorrow , it will be so bad that it will be really rather a good thing for UKIP and our view that we should not be part of this massive socialist experiment . #% In the circumstances I feel bound to say that I personally can not give my support to Mr de Roo 's Amendments Nos 3 and 4 . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner how she intends to deal with the almost impossible task for her staff of approving SPDs and CSFs in time to get those programmes rolling . #% I read an article setting out all the telephone providers ' arguments as to why you do not understand their objections . #% We wanted to ensure that the ELDR voice was heard tonight , heard to congratulate our rapporteurs and the Commissioner and to say that we very much support the work that is being done in this reform process . #% Nevertheless we first have to undertake full and thorough consultation and negotiation as a matter of courtesy to our staff but also to encourage the sense of ownership of reform which is essential to success . #% Iraq is a formidable enemy . #% It is aspirational for the future to deliver the consumer confidence that we really need to make the market work . #% Certainly the cost of clean-up laws must be taken into account when a law is adopted . #% He presumably hopes that , with a change of government , he will be allowed back . #% The European Union itself is undermining democracy in all its Member States . #% Mr President , the Radwan report has addressed honestly many of the issues which relate to the functioning of the Central Bank , ranging from prudential banking supervision and the cost of international money transfers on the one hand , to convergence requirements for applicant countries and the role of this Parliament in providing the framework for the accountability of the ECB on the other . #% It is clear that appraisal and career structure are inextricably linked together . #% We also endorse the benefits for companies of involving their employees in workplace decision-making , but reject the imposition of any ` one size all ' statutory model of participation . #% I would like to support what Mrs Banotti said . #% Would you consider renaming ? #% It is not worth the paper that it is written on . #% I wonder , in relation to Ireland , for example -- being a neutral country and not part of Nato -- whether the advancement of the security strategy , the planned intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Defence Capabilities Agency are areas on which you will be putting extra emphasis . #% Meanwhile , this Parliament continually calls on both France and Britain to decommission their independent nuclear deterrents . #% But things do not stop there , and that is why I think it is a welcome opportunity to give you , the Commission , the chance to reassure us that you are keeping a very close eye on developments , on test results , and ensuring that the provisions of the existing legislation and the future legislation will continue to be updated to reflect the growing amount of scientific evidence about potentially hazardous chemicals . #% Let us hope that the Members of this House will sign declarations in future . #% In several areas I fully support him : openness , transparency , freedom of information . #% Motorcycles constitute a very small percentage of traffic volume . #% Mr President , I am very much in favour of this programme . #% Mugabe 's re-election will seriously exacerbate all of these problems . #% I want rights enshrined in law which can not be taken away - not gifts , but rights . #% Please support the Green/EFA amendment to this resolution which seeks to do exactly that . #% The fact that more and more free-range eggs are being bought and that more and more retailers are now moving towards the sale of free-range eggs demonstrates the concern of people in many countries of the European Union . #% There is no justification for terrorism , whatever the perceived provocation . #% People who have made a long-term commitment to producing a first-class product now suddenly find that pigs which previously sold for # 34 to # 40 are now being sold for # 10 or # 12 . #% In my region , for example , the port of Dover will be encouraged to switch more goods from roads to railways . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr P√©rez √Ålvarez for an incisive and thoughtful report . #% They are more intelligent ; they are more hard-working ; they can apply themselves and yet , even when they go into higher education , into the start of a research career , they sometimes fall away . #% It is not undemocratic . #% However , it should be noted that certain countries only implemented this directive last year and that at least one country has not yet implemented certain provisions at all . #% Madam President , this is the third time in four months that this Parliament has held a special debate on Colombia and we will continue until the gross violations of human rights come to an end . #% British Conservative Members of the PPE-DE Group voted against this report because we feel that it moves too far away from the Commission 's original intention of tightening up budgetary control mechanisms . #% I am a little disappointed to see that Mr Barroso , the President of the Commission , seems to have disappeared , because he is going to hear a comment from a representative of the United Kingdom , which is the second biggest contributor to European Union funds . #% Mr President , in the course of the last few months I have had the privilege , on a number of occasions , to declare to this Parliament that the Group of the Party of European Socialists strongly supports the accession of 10 new Member States to the EU on 1 May 2004 . #% 
I know that pressure has been put on them in the past about this building , so I would like to seek those assurances on behalf of the trade unions and the other workers . #% The British Conservatives , who form the European Democratic wing of the PPE-DE Group , voted against the B√∂sch report in total because , yet again , there is mention of the European public prosecutor and explicit comments to confer more extensive powers on it when set up , thus leading to Corpus Juris . #% It means that there is too much time wasted , too much long-winded dialogue , too much wasteful use of audit resources so that by the time we come to a discharge procedure , we are dealing with out-of-date information . #% I will not tolerate that kind of attack on the officials of the Commission and the way in which they have demonstrated their dedication to the public interest by seeking to fulfil the mandate given to the Commission by this elected House . #% What would happen if that legal challenge is successful ? #% I feel I should raise a point of order in relation to what the Commissioner has just said . #% Mr President , I represent the region in the north-east of England which was the scene of the original outbreak and has just recently been affected by further outbreaks . #% I am sure the House will welcome the fact that the way Parliament voted means we will be able to get an agreement at first reading . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report and largely we can agree with most of the contents . #% It is vital that we do not rush to judgment and that we await the outcome of the inquiries that are being undertaken in the United Kingdom . #% Next Wednesday the British Government proposes to introduce a new law on hunting which will aim to criminalise some of the most decent , law-abiding and responsible people in the UK . #% At the same time , it is unnecessary to raise the costs of trading by insisting on concentrating the clearing of such trades through single bourses . #% Against that background , timely action by President Yeltsin in signing into law the Russian draft legislation on money laundering would be reassuring to the international community . #% On the other hand , the EMI report talks glibly about the rigidities of the labour market and seems to follow the simplistic approach that labour-market flexibility means poorer wages and conditions for workers rather than improving their mobility through education , training and investment . #% I understood this House to provide immunity from prosecution or from reprisals for words uttered in this Chamber during a plenary session . #% What we have is a plan full of warm words and good intentions but short on firm commitments , in particular on trade issues . #% That would make a link between the vote for a parliament and the resultant composition of the executive that people are indeed used to when they vote in national elections in European countries . #% So I beg to differ with Commissioner Patten . #% I say we also need to secure jobs in small businesses , and this will help us achieve this goal . #% If we are going to do it partially , then let us at least do it sector by sector , not by horizontal decoupling across all sectors . #% Well , I wish to inform you that this is a political institution , which is why we are approaching the European Commission to help us achieve that solution . #% We should be reflecting on why General Motors tells us that it needs to save EUR 500 million a year in costs to make itself competitive . #% Mr President , firstly , may I say to many colleagues here who are directly affected in the Limburg region , that I represent a region in the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which has probably been more affected by structural change in the automotive industry than any other region in Europe . #% They talk about European identity and the fundamental character of the Union to hide their true belief that a country with a majority Muslim population should never be allowed to join . #% We need further research into prevention . #% Another matter of deep concern is the disappearance of leaders of the people , R. Cortez and G. de Varez , which shows that there are forces which are prepared to use violence and prevent land reform . #% But we still face problems . #% We must recognise the difficulties that some applicant countries have faced and that they have made enormous progress in a very short period of time . #% Mr President , I have not heard such unanimity across the Chamber on an issue in quite some time . #% We have supported the latter because , then , more criminals get caught . #% We need to very careful about that . #% The report is not specifically concerned with animal welfare as such , but with good husbandry and avoidance of unnecessary stress to animals . #% We need to look at how to develop internal investment . #% I would like to begin by sincerely thanking her for the hard work that she has done on this dossier . #% When that happens , then we must prepare to go to war . #% The other matter is a perennial matter which comes up each year : the European women 's lobby and finance for women 's organisations generally . #% Besides the single common procedure and content of protection , there needs to be practical cooperation , support and solidarity , including through the important European Asylum Support Office , providing common sources of country information . #% On 7 March UNMOVIC published a document entitled ` Unresolved disarmament issues : Iraq 's proscribed weapons programme ' . #% I should like to ask the President of the Commission to what extent Parliament 's conclusions as set out in its resolution of 9 May were taken into account in drawing up the document referred to today , especially Parliament 's references to the need to eliminate existing rigidities in the labour market , its reference to a reduction in non-wage labour costs and to the adaptation of working time and work organization . #% This causes real problems for those organisations . #% Some people have already referred to this and I was Parliament 's rapporteur . #% Secondly , at the same time , of course , it will enable those people engaged in money laundering - I know this is not a report on money laundering , but it is a connected issue - to also move their ill-gotten gains around fairly easily and fairly simply . #% At that point we recognised there was a serious problem . #% Quite frankly , that was not leading us forward . #% The Ghent European Council showed that the Union enjoys both the capacity , and the will , to provide an increased sense of European security , solid in support of American self-defence , and sharing in the campaign to combat terrorism . #% We need it for our committees to be able to get to work and plan their work and appoint rapporteurs who can work with the Commission in the pre-legislative phase . #% I would have preferred ever more resources and a set of programmes closer to the market , but at least the Union is moving in the right direction . #% On Parliament 's budget , we would like to emphasise the need for extended provision for freelance translation - because this is going to be an important factor in the years ahead . #% The limitation of working time has been an historic struggle for the labour movement and we should not be giving that away in the 21st century . #% GBP 1.5 billion worth of exports has been lost in the UK because of it . #% Lastly , in terms of administration policy , there are the Technical Assistance Offices . #% And did the German Government , in fact , vote against that directive originally ? #% Why has he done that ? #% Furthermore , there is no proof whatsoever of the existence of CIA detention camps in either Romania or Poland , neither do I believe that there has been a systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to torture abductees in third countries . #% It is essential to establish a single European system , but one based on fairness , full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions , including an end to routine detention . #% All these points are necessary , because the people making decisions are deciding on what are matters of life and death for many of the people they see . #% None of that can be achieved with a background of violence or the continuing threat of violence . #% On that basis I have to vote against this particular amendment with the threat it would pose to minorities . #% It is being aired at the Convention with doubts , which I share , about the apparent demotion of consumer priorities by an amalgamated Council , which also has to cover social affairs , employment and health . #% I do not think it should be a pretext either for the Commission and Parliament to seek to carry out an extension of powers which conflict with Member States ' rights . #% In the European Union consumers are particularly resistant to genetically modified food and the governments of Luxembourg and Austria are moving against current European policy . #% Any criteria we make on economic partnership agreements must be based on their relationship with the Millennium Development Goals . #% When we talk about south-south assistance we should at the same time congratulate the Iranian Red Crescent for mobilising more than 8 000 relief workers , and , despite what Robert Kilroy-Silk may say in the UK , Arab countries , who have offered 400 million for the reconstruction of Bam . #% However , it has to be said that the human rights policy of the European Union has grown up on a very ad hoc basis . #% Today , however , we welcome the return of Europe in a different guise . #% We believe , however , that this can happen further down in the legislative process . #% 
That was what it was all about . #% Then we can all take an informed decision . #% If there is no international presence in Darfur there will be a total massacre , notwithstanding all the hand-wringing and assertions of ` never again ' after Rwanda . #% I can assure you , Sir , that this issue will not go away , and you will have to face a vote sooner or later . #% The report that Parliament is putting forward recognises that there are different relationships now . #% I take Mr Collins ' point that we need some regulation of control on au pairs . #% What I have been hearing about the representative in Nicaragua is indicative that the project had not been properly closed down . #% Mr President , my group welcomes this report , mainly because of two key points that it contains . #% That is not to say that the British Presidency will not be significant . #% With the coming Euro the European Union will be a centre of stability in the global economy . #% But at least these proposals will allow the anti-European rubbish peddled by Mr Blokland and the UKIP to be disposed of in an environmentally-friendly manner . #% There is , however , a PPE-DE one-sizing problem . #% It is difficult to avoid cynicism if the government now opens the doors to environmental destruction in the same state . #% And we must make certain that the details are applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different countries . #% Mr President , I am very disappointed at the delay , though I am delighted now that we are going to have clear compulsory labelling . #% Instead of stabilising the prices of primary product markets , the EU is harming the very people it says it wishes to help . #% The auditors consistently report that levels of control and scrutiny of the use of EU funds within the Member States are inadequate . #% We had multiannual agreements which keep discipline , which we did not have before the financial perspectives were introduced . #% The position in the Council , if anything , is not even as good as that . #% What has the Commission been doing for the last few years ? #% In 2003 , 11 000 new millionaires were created in India , while 8 million people were unemployed and 50 million lived on less than a dollar a day . #% At this rate the increased emissions from aviation will neutralise more than a quarter of the reductions required by the EU 's Kyoto target by 2012 . #% We also need to look at the economic impact of these various policies . #% I would ask the Commissioner what she intends to do in the first half of 1997 to start to bring forward the debate about the common fisheries policy post-2000 ? #% So let us have a more balanced view ; a view that looks into the future as well . #% In the speeches I have heard recently no-one actually differentiates between borrowing for investment and borrowing for current expenditure . #% Membership of the Single Market the largest trading bloc in the world , is crucial for jobs in the North West . #% The International Committee of the Red Cross must be given immediate access to her in order to assist in the provision of emergency assistance . #% Mr President , I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur , Mrs van den Burg , and members of other groups who have helped steer us towards what hopefully will be a successful vote tomorrow . #% I very much welcomed the statement just now from the President-in-Office saying that this Parliament must play a role . #% I shall support the report and look forward to early adoption of the revised rules . #% I know that you intend to treat the peoples of Europe with contempt by pushing this through without ratification . #% This petition needs to be closed , we need answers to the question . #% In my own country nine million people already have systems operating under other standards than MHP . #% What we are talking about today is the tools , the means and the framework in which we do that . #% Yet more agencies are to be established , all without democratic accountability and all adding to remote , bureaucratic control . #% First and most crucially : money . #% It is quite clear that this will cause enormous difficulties and the situation will undoubtedly deteriorate even further . #% We very much believe that there need to be minimum standards . #% Nothing has happened on that either and this needs to be looked into urgently . #% In the event of mechanical breakdown , there appears to be some relief afforded by Article 5 , in the exemption provided for extraordinary circumstances . #% We have honoured every commitment on that and we will continue to do so . #% That is very much the pattern for the rest of Europe . #% Those who are burying their heads in the sand had better recognise that , or more tragedy will ensue . #% Unfortunately , when we went to the French courts , we were told that it was too late at that stage to get the redistribution of tickets ordered , although the French courts themselves recognised that European rules had been flouted in the procedure that was followed . #% Service providers must recognise their role in facilitating access to terminal equipment for disabled users and the framework directive must include , in my opinion , access to terminal equipment and software . #% How did Indonesian army weapons and ammunition - I have the photographs in front of me - come to be in the hands of Laskar Jihad ? #% He was the first person to pilot an own-initiative report through Parliament on motor insurance which led to the Commission producing legislation . #% There are huge vested interests involved . #% I welcome the positive statements on Turkey . #% author . - Madam President , concerning the next vote , on ` Venezuela : the case of Manuel Rosales ' , the Socialist Group , of course , has withdrawn its signature from the compromise resolution . #% Please give us some specific answers now and not just general areas of concern . #% Therefore , in the light of these two very contradictory approaches , it seems to me and to my group very logical that we should ask the Commission for more flexibility in the way in which finance can be transferred from one part of the budget to the other , because on one side we have too little and on the other we have too much . #% Who said ` when in doubt , hold a committee meeting ' ? #% Equally , I have learnt , from being a member of the Committee on Petitions , that one of the petitioners is about to bring a case before the Court of Justice . #% I was rather disappointed , given the excellent partnership between the public and the private sectors in Ireland in helping to realise the very high growth rates in Ireland in recent years , that the Prime Minister should say that in a market economy there is little role for government action . #% The cost to the taxpayer of the Strasbourg seat is estimated at around # 150 million per annum . #% This will lead to more competition and , therefore , greater choice for investors , cheaper capital for businesses , and more funding opportunities for many businesses that might be denied finance if they were limited to their national market . #% The red lines are set , as it were , in tablets of stone , and I hope that we will not go too far towards conceding too much . #% If you read our Amendment 29 , for example , you will see that the regulation applies only to documents held by the institutions , although it does set the standards that agencies will be expected to follow in adopting their own rules on public access to their documents , in accordance , I might add , with the joint declaration adopted by the Council , the Commission and Parliament on 30 May 2001 . #% It is a pity that Parliament is doing it ; we asked the Commission to take it off the table and rewrite it , but it would not do so . #% It seems to me that we are not ordering our affairs as efficiently as we should . #% That is why it is so important that we never forget , and with Poland rightly taking its place in the European Union last year we can be sure that those who suffered and those who inflicted the suffering will not be forgotten . #% Romania has changed . #% I thought the Commissioner was going to disappoint me and then , just as I was grimacing , he brought us a date of 29 May . #% Mr President , we voted against this report as British Conservatives because although we are in favour of much of what is in the report - we are particularly pleased to see that classic and vintage vehicles will be exempted - we are concerned about the principle of substitution . #% 
in writing . - The EPLP welcomes Mr Visser 's report into tax evasion linked to import and other cross-border transactions . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank the Council and the Commission , especially the Council for its tough declaration on 8 November . #% Irrespective of his legal status and international law , he has been cruelly kept incommunicado in Gaza , deprived of any contact with the outside world and even denied Red Cross access , which the Geneva Conventions mandate . #% In conclusion , Commission action on monitoring Community law is crucial to fulfilling our essential mission of preserving the Community legal order , fairly , firmly , consistently , and with public understanding . #% Mr President , I am very pleased that we have this balanced compromise and I am glad that we have rejected the idea of a ban only on products designed to go in children 's mouths . #% This Parliament has proposed various mechanisms for introducing this legitimacy . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner responsible tonight what we will do if the SLORC continue to deny Aung Sang Suu Kyi 's latest request for a dialogue with the SLORC . #% Indeed , Parliament should have the right to give its assent to such appointments and that is why the PPE-DE Group will vote to reject the Liberal amendment . #% At the same time we need to go further in eliminating export subsidies and much further in responding to ACP and LDC concerns in particular . #% It is to be regretted that later treaties did not come up to its standards in those ways . #% That is a vile misrepresentation . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , this is an extraordinary debate . #% We are opposed to the introduction of sweeping new categories of eligibility for asylum , which would be open to abuse . #% We have global industries operating in European markets . #% In addition , I would stress the need for good design of these sheets to ensure they are comprehensible to all users throughout the Union , which is not easy when dealing with technical material like this in many different languages . #% The exchange of information helps combat terrorism . #% This must play a role in the future allocation of agency funding in the European Union . #% I might perhaps send you those reports , Commissioner . #% As the Firth of Clyde forum recently explained , we lack any measure of security , political or financial , which would give us a strong footing for pursuing longer-term management . #% The burden of paying a full rate of VAT makes keeping them in repair that much more difficult , so I very much hope that Parliament and Council support reduced rates of VAT for those kinds of repairs to historical listed buildings . #% That question must be asked . #% A number of problems have already been raised by people such as the Belgian Police Federation , and there have been many documentaries in various countries about various games and the security arrangements for Euro 2000 . #% This is not the time for a debate on nuclear power except to say that it is the future . #% Madam President , there is an error on page 8 of the Minutes where the President is described as referring a letter from a colleague to the Bureau . #% It means that the most dangerous ships will be inspected in future . #% Where is this going to end ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , International Women 's Day gives us a united opportunity to focus on issues and challenges women face today - to focus on the various forms of inequality that many women experience , but also to celebrate achievements by women throughout the century . #% It would not be out of keeping with Mr Sarkozy 's remarks about defending French protectionism and it would also be disastrous for the market economies of the Eurozone . #% Mr President , my problem is covered by Rules 2 and 3 of the Parliament 's Rules of Procedure , that is , the rule concerning mandates and the rule concerning privileges and immunities . #% The Council has also decided that it wants the target for the maximum number of exceedances to be 25 rather than 20 days . #% That legislation has got to be ambitious . #% What steps has the Commission taken to try to persuade the Portuguese authorities to stop construction of this dam ? #% This is of course an important agreement , important because Slovenia , as a number of Members have said , is clearly a strong candidate for future membership of the European Union . #% After more than five years in the pipeline , we have finally voted today on the proposal for a Council directive relating to fruit jams , jellies , marmalades and sweetened chestnut pur√©e . #% I could not agree more . #% On Amendment No 18 - league tables - airlines should be named and shamed for poor performance . #% The main areas specified as problems in the Court of Auditors ' report concerned the ECB 's project management and monitoring . #% Many of them are still awaiting the promised compensation from the previous , much more long-drawn-out blockade . #% We would encourage the Lebanese Government to take robust action in this field . #% I will take the advice of the Commission on this occasion , but I hope that we get it right . #% No tinkering around with additional protocols will convince the sceptical public to vote in favour of Treaty changes which are difficult to explain and bring nothing of real benefit to improve the effective operation of the European Union . #% Let me pick up the point made by Mr van Velzen because I think this process is in two stages . #% It is easy to scaremonger about the situation in Russia , but the fact remains that over one-third of the population live below the breadline , while the social infrastructure in the country has disintegrated . #% We also have to make it clear that Turkey has to recognise the right of Cyprus to negotiate to join the European Union if we are to develop relations . #% We ask for your assistance on that case . #% These will be seen by the European Parliament as major sacrifices , but they are necessary to secure ratification of the package by all 27 countries . #% People are very soon going to learn that in this place nothing is what it seems . #% It seems that everything is going so well and that is good . #% However , it is now time to move from discussion about NGOs , civil society and non-state actors in order to effect real change and improvement . #% So will you please ask the Bureau to review the operation of Question Time because some simple reforms on the number of supplementaries and the length of the answers from Commissioners would go a long way to help this place seem a lot less remote to a lot more people . #% I hope that the Commission will listen to us on this point and will truly mainstream opportunities for women within this financial assistance . #% How many thousands of pages did it add to the mountain of legislation ? #% Mr President , it is my privilege to speak again in a debate with Mrs Halonen . #% Elevate 's project offers victims a safe haven and supports them in rebuilding their confidence and ability to function in society . #% Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country 's respect for and adherence to human rights . #% Of course we agree that this should happen , but we should also recognize that the preferred means of achieving this , namely WTO-compatible FTAs will carry with it very significant adjustment costs in what are , of course , extremely poor and vulnerable countries and economies . #% But this apparently is not enough . #% Poor Greece , trapped inside the economic prison of the euro ! #% I am surprised at what she says as we went further than the common position a week ago in Beijing . #% We also want the European Parliament to stand up and to do its job for once ! #% The conflagration in the Middle East resulting from that Scud missile is beyond imagination . #% Mr President , I welcome the debate this afternoon and welcome Mr Verheugen 's comments this morning , which were extremely positive . #% On the question of advertising and consumer information , I urge Parliament to accept the amendment that asks the Commission to look again at this issue . #% You may have beaten the record . #% The reason is that we can be accountable : the rules are already set down and agreed between the three institutions . #% They have hidden the Thai flu for maybe two months . #% 
It is obvious , as others have said , that EURES needs to be adequately resourced , expanded and promoted if it is to meet its full potential and respond to the needs of individuals . #% In the health and safety field as well , there is a need to update and modernise the legislation we adopted in the past : the pregnant women at work directive , five years overdue for review ; the noise directive of 1986 , ten years overdue for review ; a number of directives that need to be radically updated and modernised . #% So let us keep a sense of proportion and make sure we do not throw the baby out with the bath water . #% I do not want to see origin marking as a non-trade barrier . #% Mr President , the amazing thing about this report is that it includes the phrase `` the territory of the European Union now constitutes a single area without frontiers as regards roads '' . #% Any weaker position on the part of the EU will not help the people of Iraq , but will condemn them to perpetual tyranny . #% The President-in-Office made an extremely interesting remark in passing in the first half of his first answer when he referred to the President of the Commission having been a former Member of the European Council . #% . I and my British Conservative colleagues have voted against the Parliament 's reports on the budgetary discharge because , for the eleventh year running , the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance of the overall EU accounts . #% The immediate priority is to stop talking incessantly about the Statute and take some steps to do something about creating it . #% However , there are two major anxieties which I wish to express . #% Support for childcare for children under the age of six , for instance , is essential for equal opportunities and for the Commission to be able to attract staff , particularly women , from Member States with advanced systems . #% West Germany 's experience in pouring almost a thousand billion euro into East Germany shows what it costs to try to create a level playing field for a poor neighbour . #% Madam President , it gives me great pleasure tonight to be able to present my report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to the House on universal services and users rights relating to electronic communications . #% There are fears about your use of civil society , which we all know really means consulting lobby groups . #% Mr President , speaking as a British Conservative I would like to congratulate Prime Minister Blair on his recent robust defence of the British rebate in the House of Commons and in Westminster . #% I look forward to the Commission taking this point on board . #% In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda . #% British business is already at the forefront in realising the potential of e-commerce in Europe . #% But this has to be compatible with the single market . #% The proposals before us are very much concerned with regulations to ensure that the consumer buying organic animal products really is getting food that has been produced naturally from animals fed on wholesome natural feedstuffs and raised non-intensively in humane conditions . #% So we need conservation areas , if you like . #% Further north , the Nottingham rural community council have set up a similar project in an area of serious mining deprivation , and this is bringing enormous benefits to many of the people in that area . #% A failure or further delay would be catastrophic for Parliament ' s reputation with its public . #% To encourage more participation , we should follow the spirit of the Citizens ' Initiative - namely that it should be as accessible and easy to use as possible . #% Common social objectives , yes ; a common social model , no . #% I would like to thank Mr de Roo and of course Mrs Hautala , who started this report , and the other rapporteurs for the constructive way in which we have managed to negotiate an agreement within Parliament . #% If it is not , what next ? #% But do we sell and promote what we do effectively ? #% In this particular directive we can seek further clarification from the Council . #% I am told that the Commissioner has similar problems with a rumoured enthusiasm for Cardiff City which may explain some of the difficulties we both face . #% I would like a study to be conducted on the impact of migratory birds on the spread of the disease . #% Yes , we all need to grasp the full consequences of current events and to acknowledge the failure of development concepts based purely on the free market , with the invisible hand bringing emerging economies into global capitalism at very little cost to rich countries . #% . I welcome this third annual report by the Governor of the European Central Bank , Mr Duisenberg . #% Firstly , when a new Commission is appointed , we need some vision and strategy of how to handle the internal problems of the Union . #% We may not leave during your presidency , but be in no doubt -- leave we shall ! #% I wonder whether the President-in-Office is aware that the British , but Cheshire-based , Forum of Private Business estimates that something like # 20 , 000 million is deprived from small businesses because of the problem of late payment which might otherwise be used in order to develop businesses and thus produce jobs . #% I particularly welcome his resolution because it restates our commitment to the principles of special and differential treatment of developing countries , to the importance of food security and to enhancing the accountability and social responsibility of corporations . #% There is an issue regarding the European Court of Justice approach to jurisprudence , and by and large I think it is fair to say that we would not favour judge-made law , which can in certain circumstances be anti-democratic . #% Johanna was generous enough to accept the amendments that came from the Socialist Group and although we recognize that it is late in coming to Parliament , we think that many of the proposals that are set out in this report can be acted on by the Commission in conjunction with the Foundation and without reference to the Council which I know has already met and considered this issue . #% Compensation amounting to EUR 7.5 billion has been offered to European farmers , whereas so far the ACP has only EUR 40 million . #% Many will be small , community-based schemes which will be site-specific , whether using wind , waves , solar power , combined heat and power or even biomass . #% Therefore we have tabled an amendment asking for 25 % of members ' allowances within the Committee of the Regions to go into the reserve until the rapporteur provides us with much of the information we have requested . #% It saddens me to say that the President of this House , Mr P√∂ttering , remains indifferent to the attacks upon the integrity of this House . #% Mr President , I rise to join the previous speaker in condemning the outrage of someone tossing a hand grenade into the courtyard of the Patriarchate . #% We can not expect Mrs Gradin and the UCLAF unit to do it by themselves . #% Often governments which bring a country into the family of the European Union suffer as a result ; they are not re-elected . #% Firstly , there is going to be mandatory inspection for certain ships . #% As Commissioner Bangemann knows , no one has fought harder for the principle of industrial policy in this House over the last three years than myself and some of the other Members who will be taking part in this debate . #% That is a real good news story . #% We expect that president will operate for eight years and no less . #% Three points : first of all on this important issue of SMP . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , these reports lay down the rules for Europol gathering and exchanging information between EU Member States - and , indeed , third-party nations - of the most personal kind about EU citizens . #% It is perfectly clear that , in this European Union , the prize for national betrayal is a high one indeed . #% I have to say to the Commission that what it is proposing is wrong and hurried . #% We therefore need , I believe , to have a large parliamentary delegation in Seattle from this Parliament at least equal in size to that of the US Congress to make sure that we can represent what the views of this House are there as well as being able to ensure that as this negotiation takes place on non-tariff as well as tariff issues . #% Speaking as a Briton , and with a deep commitment to the process of peace and democracy in the Arab world , I find it paradoxical , ironic and tragic that the two countries which speak so much about democracy in the Arab world are the very countries -- the United States and the United Kingdom -- which walked away from that prison , which abandoned their international responsibilities instead of reinforcing the prison 's security . #% This is a very important step forward in controlling emissions in a sector not really yet touched . #% We welcome significant parts of the van den Burg report : its focus on improved enforcement , its call for supervisors to be given some discretion and to be allowed to exercise judgement rather than inflexibly and unthinkingly enforcing rules and ticking boxes . #% I would ask you to join me in contacting the newly privatized Stationery Office in Britain to seek clear assurances from them that all Members of this Parliament will be able to obtain the same service that has existed for our Members when it was a public body , namely proper access to all relevant documents of the British Parliament and Government , for example on economic and monetary union . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - I understand that President Barroso does not want to prejudge the outcome of the Commission 's consultation . #% I do not want anyone to assume that we do not sympathise with the contents of those amendments by the Greens , but we really want the report to be concise rather than elaborate . #% In Mr Tomlinson 's case , the other institutions report has gone pretty smoothly ; and in Stanislaw Tillich 's case , he has gone out of his way to work with the various groups to try to get good results when we voted in committee . #% I join Sophie in ' t Veld in calling for an EU road map to combat homophobia and discrimination and I call on everyone across the political spectrum in this House to unite in support of the whole range of human rights . #% It was all stitched up by the political groups -- fair enough , perhaps . #% Although it may have some spillover effect in the not too far distant future to third countries , we are not having a world-wide effect . #% We know the history as Mr Karas has already referred to it . #% 
A further important aspect of the lives of single parents , also dealt with in your report , Mrs Garc√≠a Arias , is the fact that twice as many single parent families fall into poverty and social exclusion as two-parent families . #% However , I think it is both right and helpful that readers of this report get a sense of how the Council , Commission and Parliament all contribute together to the common EU goal of promoting and protecting human rights around the world . #% I welcome Mrs Hieronymi 's report and salute her for it . #% Now you are telling us we have to have a commissioner for immigration , taking away from nation states their most basic right to decide who comes to live , work and settle in their countries . #% Mr President , I should like to make a correction to what Mrs Banotti has just said because we will be dealing with spamming and unsolicited commercial e-mails at a later plenary . #% We have seen it with Article 121 and with Greece effectively being turned into a protectorate . #% Indeed , if scientists could find a foolproof test to diagnose the disease , then it would be a major breakthrough in animal science . #% In addition to the Commissioner 's recent announcement , I welcome the recommendations made by the GFCM . #% In the development situation , as elsewhere throughout this world , the main problem for disabled people is in the attitudes and lack of awareness of other able-bodied people rather than any aspect of their physical and psychological impairment . #% I am concerned that we are following this path and are in danger of overproducing , and I would certainly like to hear the Commissioner 's response to that point . #% Mr President , if the bombardment and invasion of Iraq by the United States and allied forces go ahead unilaterally as is planned this will be a multiple injustice . #% On my most recent visit there I was encouraged to see that those three great traditions are reasserting themselves in the rebuilding of that country . #% With today 's decision on the shape of the new financial perspective now behind us , we must now look ahead and formulate the broad strategy for implementation in the coming years , whatever its imperfections in terms of balance or level of expenditure allocated . #% The problem is that we exhibit a degree of hypocrisy when some executions are more acceptable than others . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I want to congratulate my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries , Mrs Langenhagan , Mr Kindermann and Mr Kofoed , on their excellent reports which have a common underlying theme , namely sustainable fishing in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea . #% One final observation is that at the moment we are seeing a warming of relations with Iran and Syria . #% I find it rather ironic that we have been relegated to this time , given that the Commission rates this network on communicable diseases as one of the most important pieces of the post-Maastricht health framework , and also that the UK presidency gave its successful completion at conciliation a particularly high priority . #% ` Yet ' is my word , because Parliament has not yet voted on this report . #% Likewise , the legislative measures in criminal matters in respect of fraud damaging the interests of the Union will need to be carefully constructed . #% Of the 3 400 people living in the camp , 1 015 hold residence permits from , and enjoy resident status in , different countries , many of which are EU Member States , and we are not accepting these people . #% Mr Liu wants nothing more for China than those basic freedoms and civil rights that we take for granted . #% The main difference between what we already have in Directive 94/62/EC on re-use and what the rapporteur would like to introduce is a slight reinforcement of the level of encouragement to re-use . #% It is no good some countries going ahead with ratification whilst others have pronounced the text dead . #% Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry , growing financial services , good agriculture , magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities , all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources . #% However , if the European Parliament is to play a new and more responsible role it must be given greater access to the information governing trade issues than is presently the case . #% Like Mrs Jackson , I also wish to thank the rapporteur for her good work . #% In addition , the cabin crew directive should now be incorporated into this regulation . #% Yet , in the case of the North Sea , which is subject to extreme environmental and ecological pressure , the figure is up to 60 % . #% While Mr Juncker does not share these concerns , Mr Sarkozy and others have been calling for active management of the exchange rate . #% Yes , you remember , Mr Barroso , do n't you ? #% This is not a directive telling Member States how they should run their health systems as some suggest . #% This is an important report and there should be a full House here to vote on it , not just the 40 or 50 Members who might still be here at 5 p.m. #% Mr President , my delegation would like to protest at the services ' ruling that Amendment 8 is inadmissible . #% However , I welcome the Commission President 's commitment to cutting down on unnecessary legislation , which of course is a burden on business . #% Mr President , it goes almost without saying that we in the Socialist Group are delighted by the progress that the President-in-Office of the Council has been able to report . #% That is with real regret , since the motivation of the whole of that amendment is essentially one of conservation . #% As the Council is aware , because of the ongoing debate on the budgetisation of the EDF , no provisions relating to the financial framework were included in the revised Cotonou agreement . #% Mr President , the threat posed by mining and logging to the rainforest , the indigenous peoples who inhabit them and to the environment in South America is sadly nothing new . #% Many of those in their late seventies and early eighties are facing being evicted from their homes altogether . #% However , there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives . #% It is among the ethnic minority communities of cities like London , Paris , Madrid , Amsterdam and Brussels that we seek cooperation to counter terrorist threats , but where alienation and poverty are sources of tension which repressive policing will only inflame . #% These can affect respiratory functions and lead to other health problems and diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases . #% This is not an extension of existing patent law ; it is not actually taking us into any new fields . #% I would like to see more work done on the social dialogue and on developing programmes in these countries to help people affected by economic change . #% In other words , the Commission wants civil servants in the different Member States , paid salaries by the Member States , in government buildings paid for by the Member States , using facilities provided by and paid for by Member State governments , to work not for the Member States which finance them , but for the Commission implementing Community law . #% Mental health is the fastest growing cause of disability . #% I would request , therefore , Mr President , that you write to both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council to highlight this tragic loss of life and to urge them to consider how EU legislation on seat-belts in buses can be further improved . #% One way in which we can strengthen your arm is to press for action under the very welcome summit agreement signed with China in September . #% Secondly , we should have time in the hearings to follow up questions which it was quite clear were treated unevenly by the committees . #% Ahead of the meeting we are told that more sanctions are to be a central part of the solution , but sanctions need to be credible to be effective and the track record of the Union in this regard is pretty bad . #% Mr President , we must not be under any illusion that the falsification of quality control data at Sellafield was not a most serious matter . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for their comments this morning . #% There also seems to be resistance to making development an agenda item of the negotiations . #% Other EU countries ' average is ten times lower HTV taxes . #% Mr President , I am delighted we are having this debate , as it is a crucial environmental issue , which is already of great concern to many people . #% I hope the MEDIA II programme will be able to assist in that . #% By rejecting all four amendments to Mrs Flemming 's helpful report as adopted in committee this House can take a small step forward tomorrow and anticipate much larger strides in the months and years to come . #% Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this proposal has the potential to encourage the development of apprenticeships with an added European value . #% We are a parliament that is master of its own timetable , unlike some national parliaments . #% Finally , I would stress -- as did Mr Schr√∂der -- that no one must doubt how much this election matters . #% We need to make sure that these are not just covers for racism . #% NATO remains not only the fundamental guarantee of Euro-Atlantic stability and security , it is the essential framework for coalition operations . #% Finally , I urge the Luxembourg presidency to take fresh initiatives in relation to Northern Cyprus so that we can ensure we have effective economic regeneration in that part of the country . #% We are not making the Serbian people scapegoats for the actions of their leaders . #% You suggested before that this conference of the parties in Nairobi is a bit of a marking-time sort of meeting , that the lateral events might be as important as the main ones . #% Perhaps he could confirm whether my own Member State is involved or whether it will be brought in in the future . #% 
Yet we hear almost daily of new research developments , both palliative and surgical . #% The risks of an asymmetric shock developing will only get bigger after enlargement as European labour markets remain unreformed and largely immobile . #% The shocking statistic is that if the slaughter continues at its current pace , the remaining wild apes in Africa will be gone within the next 15 to 50 years -- a long time , but it will soon go if we do not stop this trade . #% Will we be so arrogant as to believe that we do not need to have a relationship with national parliaments ? #% A stronger European youth policy can help to bolster and reinforce measures taken at national level to deal with universal problems such as drugs and alcohol . #% Mr President , the Commissioner is to be warmly congratulated on the courage with which she has tackled this very difficult problem . #% Madam President , I take a rather more favourable view than the last speaker of Mr Pradier 's report . #% It is the issue of publishing the balance of votes on an anonymous basis , so that the markets and Parliament can assess the shift of opinion over time . #% As regards your paper , the European Parliament and the Commission should be partners in the construction of Europe , not rivals . #% Mrs Thorning-Schmidt has shown herself to be reasonable and willing to listen to reasonable and reasoned argument and evidence . #% The UK and the US readily share information because of their history of cooperation in fighting terrorism . #% Capacity -- building , the fight against corruption , strengthening the fight against organised crime and bringing in human rights and the rule of law -- these words are familiar to us . #% The 1992 directive on construction sites certainly goes further and specifically mentions environmental considerations . #% I only found one person who tried to vote twice , an old woman of about 80 . #% I look forward to reading the Commission 's response to the questions my colleagues and I have raised . #% The resolution pays lip service to reform but attaches so many conditions that I doubt whether the needs of enlargement , nor our obligations under the WTO , could be met . #% When the British public finally realises where all its money is going and when the Health Service in particular is so short of funding , a public call for withdrawal is quite likely . #% I strongly support his aim of getting this regulation brought into force as quickly as possible with no third reading . #% The creation of the Ombudsman can only be commended but I feel that its office needs greater promotion . #% After years of letting the airlines make the rules , passengers will finally have a legal right to the standard of customer service they deserve . #% Yesterday there was a disgraceful Communist demonstration in the courtyard of the Tower . #% There are a number of programmes that exist for teacher exchanges and for students such as the ERASMUS/SOCRATES programme . #% This is exactly what we have in the DRC where , as has already been pointed out , the desire to control natural resources plays an absolutely key role in the massive displacements of people and in the massive numbers of deaths . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , I think there are certain things to be welcomed in the action plan but , as colleagues have correctly pointed out , there are a number of questions there that have not been answered . #% It is not enough just to say that we have looked after SMEs , that we have the employment and growth initiative . #% We have no framework directive on these areas , which are essential in combating poverty and encouraging social cohesion and are of particular importance to women . #% Last week in Rome I and my colleagues had a series of meetings in connection with the reaction to terrorism . #% However , because of the special issue of over-worked junior doctors in the UK , as Conservative MEPs we voted last November to extend the directive to them . #% According to the Commission 's estimate , this will cost them an additional EUR 338 million a year . #% I would like to ask the Presidency to find a means of dealing with such excessive , fraudulent and oppressive approaches . #% We sincerely want the official signature of the Accession Treaty to take place on 16 April in Athens . #% Every pressure must be brought to bear to allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors back in . #% If such a system were already in place we would not be facing the difficulties we face at present over the Commission 's proposals for a cod recovery plan for the North Sea . #% Each country can not send its food and farming police to sample the corn , chew the cattle and spot-check the vines in every other country . #% I have accepted compromises that I would have preferred to have avoided . #% Without them , we would have seen the continued brutal repression of the Shias and the Kurds . #% I want this Parliament to call upon the Commission to look at this issue from a European Union perspective for the first time and reinstate these families ' full civil and political rights . #% Some busy people may not notice a new transaction , especially if the amount is a common one . #% He is quite right , and it is clear that there is no Community legislation which lays down detailed rules on the protection of workers ' representatives against dismissal . #% Does the President-in-Office agree with me that part of the problem is that different countries are proceeding with liberalisation at different rates ? #% Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation , having access to EQUAL , I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees . #% He pinpoints variations in interpretation , types of derogation and manner of transposal as contributing to defects in its implementation . #% Mr President-in-Office , thank you for such a comprehensive answer to seven questions . #% We have no grumbles or gripes about what this organisation does -- it is badly needed -- but we do have our concerns about how it does it . #% More focused and determined action is needed to deal with these problems and encourage return to Afghanistan . #% In the steel industry journal The Metal Bulletin of 12 November it said that US steel company executives and trade union representatives met a few days ago with President Clinton in order to push their case for exceptional protection against steel imports . #% The second question is : what is meant by the phrase , it ` may go beyond the ' ? #% It would be appropriate at the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly that we should hear , particularly from the Council , where the responsibility lay for the decisions , who took them , when and why they were taken . #% In developing countries people experience disabilities caused , for example , by landmines ; for every child killed by a landmine three more are permanently injured . #% When two founding Member States reject the Constitution with no expectation of holding a second vote , it is hard to see the logic of continuing the ratification process . #% A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines . #% The most important point in the Weiler report - and this focuses on the real problem , the real reason why our social security bills are so high - is that we are faced with such a high proportion of unemployed men and women , so the real challenge to all of us here in the European Union is to create a Europe of full employment . #% I rarely agree with David Martin but I do on this . #% The latest one from the Committee Against Torture makes the point again : that torture techniques , which should be abhorrent to any decent person , are still being used . #% Our health service is seriously under funded and our navy , which is a fraction of the size it once was , can hardly afford to pay for the fuel it needs to go to sea . #% If this had not been the case , with the exposure limit set at 87 , hammering steel at 95-100 decibels , bottling at 98 decibels , and pig-feeding at 100 decibels would have ceased to exist , as would the construction and mining industries . #% Mr President , the two excellent reports from Mr De Luca and Mrs Wemheuer have shown one thing quite clearly : that tourism , although it has been a problem , is also a symptom of a much bigger problem . #% The Council , as I have said , is considering listing the LTTE as a terrorist organisation . #% Mr President , it is indeed good to hear the Council and the Commission restate so firmly the European Union commitment to renewing transatlantic cooperation . #% I am sorry that the discussion about one Member has taken so long that once again the discussion about the poorest countries of the world and how we can more effectively aid them has been relegated and diminished . #% If we make that position clear we will be supporting people like Mr Rugova . #% This measure should assist new entrants . #% Let this be the real lesson to all of us . #% Could you not consider using the French jets that are currently in neighbouring Chad to monitor the airspace and stop the Sudanese from terrorising the people of Darfur ? #% As a result of this report we will be taking a few , albeit tentative , steps towards creating mobility for those in education , teachers , students , academics and others , so that they can actually move from one country to another within the European Union , make that a reality and take a first step forward . #% But when we look at the very valuable analysis that has been done on VAT collection in the Member States , we see this alarming figure of a gap between the theoretical VAT yield and the actual collection running at ECU 70 000m a year . #% 
The report deals with five main themes , in my view : the role of the auditor itself , the liability of auditors , the qualifications of auditors and professional regulation , the mobility of auditors in the European Union , and the need for universal standards for the statutory audit . #% Why does the Commission fail to talk now about the alternatives which were written into the Cotonou Agreement ? #% You can see it in my own region , inner London , the richest area in the European Union , which also has tremendous levels of poverty . #% I would remark in passing that there is no country in the world where freedom of expression is absolute . #% author . - Mr President , the Small Business Act was given a warm welcome by SMEs , but that was two years ago . #% Mr President , the President-in-Office of Council said that the European Union will not fail to give a welcome to legal migrants . #% Let us look at individual countries . #% I agree that it must be possible for MEPs to speak and listen in their own languages , but that is not necessarily true for Commission or Council officials . #% Let me set out what the targets are : free and compulsory education for all , halving adult illiteracy by 2015 , eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary schools by 2005 and extending learning opportunities for adults and young people and improvements in the quality of education provided . #% I also hope that our work can come to mean that those diagnoses will not represent a death sentence ; rather a diagnosis needs to become a trigger for early , sensitive , humane intervention , successful treatment and re-entry into the world of work and a full and fulfilling life . #% This is not the case with their Members here , or at least not all of their Members here - I noticed that the two British Conservative Members in the committee voted for the M√©ndez de Vigo/Seguro report and I pay tribute to them for having done so . #% Simply shouting louder will not do ! #% While I am now reasonably content with the outcome of Mr Perry 's report , I must , in the interests of balance , make some comments . #% Madame President , can I congratulate the two rapporteurs , Mr Gallagher on the protection of juveniles of marine organisms , and Mrs Fraga on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and acquacultural products . #% They are sensible and pragmatic and I would urge the Commission -- for that parts of the report which are addressed to the Commission , such as those pertaining to the Financial Regulation -- to take them up . #% We must uphold our standards and values in future , not erode them further . #% I think that is true . #% People do not volunteer to pay tax and in the final analysis the money demanded is taken under the threat of force . #% Finally , we would have welcomed something that picked up on the sustainable development strategy as regards the issue of targeted training for professions in helping to meet climate change requirements . #% It is also a tricky issue as we have seen in countries such as Algeria , or , in the past , South Africa . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , we should never forget in this House that the freedom to debate and dissent that we so much enjoy in Europe is scarce and non-existent in many parts of the world . #% The labour camp in Lagos that I mention in the question was actually known by local residents as a slave dump or children market . #% After Lisbon , we in the UK will be ruled to a greater or lesser extent by the three amigos : the President of the Commission , the newly appointed President of the Council - who must surely be Tintin 's grandfather - and , more crucially , the High Representative , Mrs Cathy Ashton , who , in her mature 30s , was one of four paid officials of the far left CND . #% However , the Shoah , the mass murder of 6 million Jewish children , women and men in Europe , can never be compensated for . #% The first one is in relation to the Helms-Burton legislation and our relations with the United States . #% They have moved at tremendous speed in order to catch up , and it has been very difficult for them . #% The British Court of Appeal has branded the detention of prisoners there as a legal black hole . #% Secondly , and without subtracting an iota from my support for the report and the directive as a whole , the Council will have to resolve a number of outstanding issues : on representative actions , on the definition of indirect discrimination and , as the previous speaker said , on the burden of proof . #% This is no way for a Parliament that is supposed to be serious to conduct its foreign policy and relations with other countries in other parts of the world . #% Other security mechanisms must be found : for example , the reformed WEU and a revitalized OSCE . #% In the interests of the long-suffering people of Angola , it is vital that the UN , subject of course to the safety of its personnel , continues to be involved in Angola . #% Apparently there were problems with the French and Spanish translations of ` moving away from the institutionalisation of people with disabilities ' . #% Well , I am all for free trade . #% Those who deny that and say that we are still in the position of total obstruction , are really admitting - as those are who wish in the vote tomorrow to reject the common position - that they do not want this directive at all . #% Thousands still languish in camps . #% I am confident , speaking today , that will be the case . #% I would like to pick up a point made by Commissioner Schreyer - and this is what I heard through the English interpretation , not the Finnish interpretation - when she said that EUR 59 million would be needed and the flexibility instrument would have to be used . #% Nevertheless it is a good agreement , and I think if we have good guidance to accompany it to ensure uniform application across the European Union , we will all have done a good job and hopefully we will radically reduce that figure of one million needle-stick injuries per year . #% Mr President , first of all may I congratulate Mr Wiebenga on what is a very well-intentioned and wellpresented report . #% Money must be spent before accession to strengthen structures in the rural areas and to avoid a rural exodus and mass unemployment . #% I am convinced that in plant , animal and human biology lie the biggest challenges of the 21st century . #% Mrs Malmstr√∂m and Mrs van der Laan have asked me specifically to mention them in this connection . #% After all , we have ignored the provisions of the interpretation up until now . #% I welcome the measures taken by the Commission in the last few days to help lift the embargo . #% You simply will not . #% It seems to me that this report is something of an appetiser - or hors d'oeuvre - for the Galileo report , which we will be considering next month in our Strasbourg part-session . #% But trade is not an end in itself . #% The same equally applies within the European Union . #% We felt it very important that jurisdiction should be in the Member State of the offeree company to avoid any ambiguity or confusion . #% We should be clear on that . #% He is aware that 45 000 people - as Mr Cornelissen has already said - are killed every year and more than one million are injured . #% It should also be made quite clear that the Commission plays an important role - as do the Member States ' standard setters - in the formulation of the standards according to the IASC 's due process procedures . #% He says he has drawn up 15 reports in his time . #% This includes some 31 000 chemical weapons and 45 missiles unaccounted for . #% My specific question is : is it true that there are still some EU institutions that have age barriers so that if you are over a certain age , you can not be employed by them ? #% It defies belief that was the only reason . #% If that is exaggerated , it is certainly true that huge extra sums will be needed to prevent pensions collapsing , so premiums will rise massively . #% But we do not need to politicise higher education through programmes such as the Bologna and the Erasmus processes . #% Votes should take precedence over everything else and should be at a fixed time , so that inconvenience is not caused to everyone by having votes at ridiculous times such as this . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , as the Kirilov report makes clear , the countries of the South Caucasus are strategically important to our Union , not least in terms of energy security , e.g. Caspian oil and gas production and transit through the countries of the region . #% He added : ` We are not excluding the scenario of leaving the Pact as it is ; that is now a distinct possibility . #% This is ruled by secret committees , faceless bullying bureaucrats , and accountability by smoke and mirrors . #% Madam President , I did not wish to delay proceedings earlier but your answer to me was that an abstention was not the same as not participating in the vote . #% It should be about enabling change and promoting the power of the workers to cope with it . #% We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right . #% So our policies have to reflect that . #% 
In the south the main targets for the remnants of the Taliban are foreigners , but without reconstruction work , the temptation for the local population is to see the situation as no better , if not worse , than under the Taliban . #% Parliament 's Legal Service has said this poses no danger of creating a situation where third-country nationals have greater access than A8 citizens . #% Mr President , you seem to have forgotten that there is at least one group in this Parliament that is eurosceptic , that opposed the European Constitution and , for good measure , is rather bigger than the UEN Group . #% From all of this , after so much distress , much good can come for both consumers and producers in the Community . #% I regret that the Human Rights Council is now going into the General Assembly , where it will be subject to wrangling and horse-trading . #% But at the end , if there is no possibility of a diplomatic solution , the military option must be considered as a very last resort . #% It takes no account of the publicly available record showing that technical boards of the EPO are independent of both the EPO examining division and EPO practices . #% I look forward to seeing the Commissioner 's proposals being brought forward very soon , in particular where mental health is concerned . #% In land ownership there are all sorts of problems over tenure . #% The fact that she , as the democratic leader of the opposition in that country , is asking the European Union to do that should surely be a signal to us to take action immediately . #% It is precisely at a time when prosperity is returning to Member States across this European Union that those marginalised from the world of work can and must be helped . #% This means that we have an absolute duty to look not just at Saddam Hussein but at all of those officials . #% Add the further contradiction of Mrs Vlasto , which extends port control to ships anchored offshore . #% This is a depth of solidarity which was not there for those other workers whose governments were and are forbidden to subsidize these jobs under EU rules . #% Firstly , I thank Mr Watson for the information . #% It therefore can not be said that the Greens opposed it . #% If Romania follows faithfully the Commission 's new and excellent roadmap and has the support of the Commission , the Council of Ministers and Parliament , Romania can most definitely reach her target date for EU entry of 1 January 2007 and reach that date not by right but by her own achievement . #% But once people have been given the information , we are adults and should be able to make up our own minds . #% I urge Parliament to rally to a consensus on this balanced and reasonable proposal . #% While the Maastricht Treaty enshrines the independence of the Central Bank , that does not mean it should be unaccountable to the people of the European Union . #% It took over a month to allocate it to a rapporteur and then , because of the summer recess , it was not possible to programme the internal debate and discussion until October and November . #% With these criteria , I consider the Community can and should offer practical and positive support to this important European industry . #% In his opening remarks , he clarified for us the perspective for the 2000 budget in putting forward the idea that we have to have more programmes , we have to have more countries and we have to have less money . #% The categories are a category-one club of a top level , with a high quality training centre ; category two : still professional but on a lower level - second division clubs in the UK ; category three : all types of third-division clubs , as in the UK ; category four : amateur players - Vauxhall Conference and other amateur footballers . #% We are , after all , an arm of the EU 's budgetary authority ; it therefore seems to me logical and coherent that , if this is going to be an important element , there would be mechanisms and systems whereby , just as in other parts of the EU - EuroMed for example - we have a dedicated budget . #% I thank the rapporteur , and I commend these amendments to the House . #% The attitude of African countries has been particularly disappointing . #% Increasing EU involvement in taxation could spell the death of the nation state . #% Similarly , reference to fattening methods should not be introduced . #% These are very good ways to ensure that the clearing and settlement service provides an excellent service to its users , but I am not really sure that we should prescribe on that issue . #% There are now , however , perhaps two areas of concern . #% Some of our amendments clarified and strengthened Article 152 as the legal base . #% If we do not complete the internal market , we will never have the basis for creating the jobs , growth , social and environmental policies we all want . #% Article 211 , which makes the Commission the guardian of the Treaties , and Article 226 , which gives the Commission the right to open infringement procedures , constitute the essential safeguard in the Treaties for the application of the acquis . #% It is not necessary to separate so-called core and value-added services , contrary to the view of the rapporteur . #% So , what are we discussing here ? #% We were all shocked by the brutal murder of Monsignor Michael Courtney -- the Apostolic Nuncio , and a man who had been playing a key part in the peace process in Burundi -- in a road ambush on 29 December 2003 . #% . On amendments which were submitted by the Green Party , I would like to make the following explanation for my vote against . #% I am speaking on behalf of our shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Party of European Socialists , Mr Needle , who can not be with us , courtesy of Air France , who have done their best this week to make this a shadow Parliament . #% I am extremely pleased at this development . #% I am delighted that , at long last , everyone has seen sense and removed natural radiation from the remit of this directive . #% This may be extreme but there will be unscrupulous people who will set up scams on the Web . #% Old war horses are trotted out again and given one more exhausted run around the course . #% There is nothing either in the communiqu√© from the Florence European Council , or indeed in the Ecofin recommendations and the Commission recommendations , which leads us to vary that opinion expressed by Parliament . #% Outwardly , Mr Galeote Quecedo 's report seems very reasonable , but on closer examination , we get a rather different picture . #% I hope that we will concentrate on the sensible and practical proposals put forward by the committee and other studies conducted into the outbreak - including the need to prevent infected meat and meat products entering the European Union . #% I currently hold passport and other details for a constituent of mine , a Pakistani citizen , who has had to travel there for family reasons and in the past has had difficulty leaving that country , even under the previous regime . #% Like Mr Roubatis , I am pleased there was a firm categorical reply that negotiations would commence six months after the IGC . #% This jacket that I am wearing was made by Crombie , a local textile firm in my town in England ; it is a good , English suit . #% Those who merely rely on creating an atmosphere of fear and hostility do little to elaborate the arguments in their favour . #% It is therefore imperative that we concentrate , in practical ways , on how to defuse these bottlenecks , especially around sea ports . #% Their speaker should justify why they oppose such a logical approach . #% That is a benefit that we should not throw away by piling into this directive overly prescriptive details , for example , on authorisation , on biometric risk , on guarantees . #% It is also a sad fact that there is a shortage of donors , and that this drives some vile criminal activities . #% I am asking you to make sure that the parts of the Constitution such as the separate military command structure , the European Space programme and the establishment of the European Union foreign embassies across the world are halted because they are only given legitimacy by a Constitution that is now best part dead . #% In the European Union , we are regulating ourselves to death . #% in writing . - I will be supporting an amendment in the Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) report which limits Member State EU contributions to the rate of inflation ( currently 3.2 % ) or below , as suggested by the Heads of State of the UK , France , Germany , Netherlands and Finland . #% Secondly , I worry that you will be all things to all people . #% In addition , we do not support paragraph 44 , which recommends military operations be funded centrally from the EU budget . #% After all , many developing countries - even if the drugs were free - do not have the infrastructures to administer the treatments . #% You have a government in Israel which wants peace and wants to secure peace and if you proceed in a rash and rapid way then you could jeopardise the success of that peace agreement . #% Mr Gollnisch has found himself prosecuted under French law -- the law of his home Member State -- for words he used at a press conference which , it is alleged , form something like Holocaust denial . #% It is quite straightforward and I appreciate that your predecessor , Mr Bolkestein , wrote saying that there were reasons for not revealing some of the correspondence . #% There are differences within Member States and across the whole of the European Union . #% On the issue of reform , James Elles has just touched on a very significant point . #% And that is that , under the UK presidency and , indeed , the preceding presidency and no doubt the one that will follow it , we are making real progress towards completing the single market by ensuring that all Member States who have signed up to European laws comply with them . #% 
The message has to go from this Chamber and from the international community that the Milosevic campaign of ethnic hatred , which began ten years ago , must end where it began - in Kosovo ! #% We must have the mutual recognition that Mr Marinho calls for . #% There were other problems with IRELA , flax and Fl√©chard , too , and all we have to do in this House is look at our previous reports . #% It is also possible to fit that in to the framework of this directive . #% How will it do that and who will it get to do it ? #% I urge you to think seriously about the imposition of a no-fly zone . #% The budget has not been easy . #% Mr President , over-production of sugar is another manifestation of the obscene common agricultural policy that protects certain producers for political reasons and penalises consumers for the same political reasons . #% One can not ignore however their very real and positive benefits in terms of reducing substantially the annual human death toll due to accidental fires . #% As someone who has many friends and relatives in many of these poorer countries , I think we have to look no further than the governments of many of these countries : poor governance issues ; state monopolies and corrupt governments that are preventing entrepreneurs in these countries from creating wealth ; the fact that they find it difficult to import the materials that they need to add value and create wealth ; also the fact that many citizens of the countries are denied access to goods and services that we take for granted here in the EU and in many richer countries . #% Members will therefore understand that it is the practice in the United Kingdom Government , like , I imagine , most or all other governments , not to comment on alleged interception whether the allegations are based on trivia or something perhaps more substantial . #% Mr President , I sincerely thank the rapporteur , Mr Cornelissen , for both his speech and report . #% The word ` by ' should be replaced by ` to ' in the relevant paragraph ( c ) . #% But that job is made very difficult by these wholly unrealistic budgets . #% That is the message that this House must carry to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and I hope everyone in this House will support such an intention . #% But , Mr Mandelson , you also said that you are pleased with the speed at which this has all gone through . #% We would also welcome the fact that this report contains - if there is going to be a change in pension provision - adequate time for adaptation for people to reconsider their financial futures . #% In return for our agreement to abstain at the end rather than voting against , the Socialists agreed to let this amendment pass . #% Nothing will be achieved if the money saved through debt relief is spent by a corrupt dictator on expensive palaces or , even worse , on attack helicopters to terrorise a section of the population . #% We have to tackle both : the problem that was the European Year of Tourism and the systems that are quite inadequate in the Commission - witness the inadequacy with which the report of the Court of Auditors was dealt with . #% His reply has not given me a great deal of confidence that it has the sort of priority that we expect . #% Will you be prepared to stand firm in face of this kind of pressure and will you acknowledge , as I do , that in the past companies like the United Fruits Company were companies which bought Costa Rica and bought Hondurus . #% There is increasing acceptance amongst Arabs of the desirability of a negotiated solution , whilst Prime Minister Sharon himself has talked of the damage to Israel 's economy and society caused by the continuing violence , and the impossibility of permanent occupation and Israeli rule over four million Palestinians . #% That is covered by a special procedure laid down in Article 141 of the EC Treaty . #% That can not present an especially attractive side of our parliamentary life and I am anxious about the reaction of public opinion . #% But the teaching of Mandarin or Cantonese Chinese , Arabic , Hindi and Russian would serve European countries far better than the insular concentration simply on EU languages . #% Madame President , my group , the EDD , and especially my party , are very concerned by this debate . #% Last but not least , I would like to express my thanks to Ross Gordon Consultants who produced an excellent study on the situation of young farmers in the European Union last year and whose publication has been of great help in producing today 's report . #% ISAF has a footprint centred on Kabul , limiting its operations to 2 % of Afghanistan 's land area . #% We have suggested that the Commission should bring to us on an annual basis a comprehensive report on its plans for future motor vehicle regulation , specifying where it is going to use the Economic Commission for Europe proposals and , indeed , covering some of the voluntary regulation process that we have talked about . #% If Parliament accepts that , we have an even greater right to ask how far the Member States will actually agree to abide by these proposals . #% This is a long story , which has been all through the Danish courts and has been the subject of many reports , debates and discussions . #% In connection with the SME envoy , could the Commissioner tell us whether the Commission plans to give the SME envoy a much more explicit remit within the better regulation programme , enabling the envoy to scrutinise legislative projects , specifically from the perspective of small enterprise , and publish a report that this Parliament can see , so that we know that the concerns of SMEs are being fully and properly reflected in the better regulation programme ? #% But we must not complacently rest on our laurels now . #% I fear that cleaning up the environment may prove to be a doddle compared to the task of persuading the UKIP to clean up its act . #% Mr President , I am disappointed with that response . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , the Middle East and North African countries of the Southern Neighbourhood clearly need the EU 's long-term political and - where appropriate - financial support . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I should like to draw the strands together as this will hopefully be our last debate on the 2007 budget . #% On the structural funds , the ECU 100 million that we have all now agreed for the Irish peace process is an excellent example of how the three institutions have worked together to ensure that this has been achieved without a legal base . #% What is the point of having a Conservative Prime Minister if Mr Blair becomes the overlord ? #% French rates , British rates or international rates ? #% I wish to put on the record the position of the ED wing of the EPP that the Council was crazy to reject the package that was on the table . #% In other words , I consider centralist EU rule , without democratic accountability , to be more of a threat to civilisation than are unlabelled , GMO-derived food additives . #% We have to ensure that , in condemning the Serbian side , we are equally tough on the Albanian side and do not , out of sympathy for one side or the other , provoke a worse situation than exists at the moment . #% Later tranches will concentrate on preparing roads for winter conditions , municipal twinning in which assistance from Member States is being requested , and subsequently public utilities , public buildings , economic reconstruction and institution-building . #% I thank the Commissioner for his reply and the very helpful information he has given me . #% Has this been properly thought out ? #% The first relates to an early-retirement scheme , which we would like to see applied in this institution as it is applied in others . #% Perhaps I could ask her to do that in advance of future budgets . #% We will always ask for more money . #% I also welcome the long-term observer and media monitoring reports , which stated clearly that the entire campaign was conducted in a spirit of transparency and fair access to the media , both by the government and by the opposition parties . #% I think the staff ought to make sure that this is prevented in the future . #% However , Romania 's recent handling of the avian flu outbreak was excellent . #% It means that , unlike many international structures , our central administration -- albeit small -- is accountable . #% These factors help to explain why my group will not be supporting amendments which seek to remove the commitment to equal treatment for those in precarious or atypical employment . #% I hope we can get away from blaming the Commission and put the blame where it lies . #% This , indeed , would be illogical - and that is the situation we are currently in . #% What a pity that the British Presidency could not be bothered to turn up this morning to listen to you ! #% I urge you , please , to ask the peoples of Europe whether or not they want this project . #% Will you , Commissioner , support Amendment No 2 ? #% The survival of children , like seven-year-old Aida Sidakova -- who we saw on our television screens returning to what we thought was her death -- is a symbol of the hope that our human spirit craves in the face of such an unspeakable act of evil . #% It is clear that the Ombudsman , reinforced by the Charter , plays an increasingly meaningful and forceful role in protecting the citizen from abuses of executive authority . #% The key is the governor of Katsina state and it is important that the presidency and the Commission and the President of our Parliament add their pleas to those many of us have already sent to Umaru Musa Yar ` Adua . #% Finally , it is rather apt , following Mrs Scallon , that I say this : let us remind ourselves in this House that these young people will become the generation that finally rid our continent of racism , sexism , homophobia , xenophobia and the other discriminations which shame us all ! #% We are now moving in the direction of creating a free market for people so that they can move around with their families and partners . #% The March presidential elections were a travesty of democracy , with repression of a free press and the MDC opposition leader now on trial for treason . #% 
This view is indeed gaining ground , thanks partly to the Dehaene report and the Commission ' s own proposals - and I pay tribute to Mr Barnier who is here with us - but it is also gaining ground and rightly so among the national governments . #% Can I welcome this communication and express my pleasure at its emphasis on the importance of this industry . #% He missed out ` keep off the grass ' and ' a miss is as good as a mile ' . #% Do you think that you can secure an agreement , based on the five amendments adopted in committee , which will both respect the views of Parliament and deliver this legislation on time as the first major achievement of the French presidency ? #% If Europe goes along this path it will be widening its fissures both vertically and horizontally and I hope very much that we shall consider carefully before embarking on this road . #% The new law will have real benefits to farmers across Europe and especially in Wales . #% It is therefore appropriate that the text of the regulation agreed in committee should be as close as possible to the guidelines agreed at the Madrid Forum . #% Does the Council share the view of my own Prime Minister , Tony Blair , that the loss of duty-free could lead to the loss of thousands of ordinary people 's jobs across the European Union ? #% The economies of the EU do not need a Lisbon Strategy : they need to be left alone to let markets work and to let entrepreneurs create jobs . #% The first results of these assessments are expected shortly . #% However , the fundamental issue of what to do following the rejection of the Constitution was not even on the table for discussion . #% The President-in-Office said that Secretary of State Rice 's statements last week should be taken at face value . #% Europe , unless it gets an unequivocal agreement with the United States that it can have access on all occasions to the GSP system , will have to work with others inside and outside the European Union , in industry and government , to develop its own independent system . #% This requires very careful consideration as we must take great care that we do not imply any sort of recognition of the legitimacy of these groups or of their actions . #% Judging by the compromise amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group , there has been quite a lot of St Valentine 's spirit around in the past month . #% I want to make it clear , though , that I do not believe that we should be using the failure of some Member States to achieve compliance with environmental legislation to justify weakening our ambitions or claiming that too much legislation is impractical . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Langen , the rapporteur , on his report on the adoption of the multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community , Altener II . #% Secondly the commitment without additional funding to widen its remit to human rights , making its already difficult task virtually impossible . #% Despite the murder , we welcome the fact that the FLN has now expressed for the first time a willingness to engage and meet with the President of the Republic with a view to opening peace negotiations . #% Why should we have to prove that they are safe when people buy them every day and believe that their health depends on them ? #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the theory of a Tobin tax has been around for years - the idea of a global tax on foreign exchange - but , of course , it has never seen the light of day . #% The accession of a new Member State as large as Turkey would dilute the influence of all other Member States and would , therefore , further compromise the self-determination of the people I represent in the UK 's East Midlands . #% However , products imported into the EU from third countries very often do not conform to those same high standards . #% Firstly , in the light of our experience from the discharge for 1996 for which I was responsible , can we really be sure that , if we do vote against an incoming Commissioner , that Commissioner will resign ? #% Some feckless person in the Commission foolishly said yes , a 250 mg limit would be acceptable . #% It concerns the Association of Former Members . #% Lastly , since some Member States are clear laggards when disposing of electrical waste , it is vital that there is ample provision of information about the new rules . #% Mr President , I , like other colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , would like to congratulate our ex-chairman Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , on all her work on this dossier . #% Congress approved this and Europe largely ignored it . #% As the report implies , this has been nothing but a catalogue of errors . #% As with past enlargements , specific measures concerning the appointment and integration of officials from the new Member States will be adopted at the appropriate time . #% I urge you all to join us in voting for sound science and sound sense . #% We also regret the need but welcome the fact that the UN Department of Peace-Keeping Operations has set up a special investigative team to look at the cases of sexual abuse and exploitation perpetrated by some of its own members in the UN organising mission in the DRC , particularly in Bunia . #% I hope the UK Presidency will be a great success . #% This hybrid sui generis approach to EU foreign policy vindicates those of us who opposed the creation of the EEAS in the first place , believing then that the EU 's global ambitions would undermine national sovereignty . #% We do not , of course , like everything . #% Finally , there is local consultation , which is needed , but should not be mandatory and it should not be a vehicle for delay . #% I would hope that some of our colleagues will remember that what we are about in this institution is building a new Europe and not refighting the battles of the old Europe . #% Europe has the know-how to prevent the deforestation . #% I know some in this House would not like to see it refined into a nuclear programme , but it could well serve as a very useful channel for non-nuclear conventional or renewable energies . #% If that were not enough , there was input from a monitoring group and four other committees . #% Businesses will not be able to afford to pay these extra costs . #% Madam President , the central question seems to be whether this Parliament and the European Union show themselves to be sufficiently self-assured to confirm Turkey ' s status as a candidate . #% This should put some fears to rest . #% The first is the combined impact of reduced resources under the new financial perspective , and the emergence of new challenges leaves us no option but to set clear priorities in the next budget . #% Despite the fact that EUR 5 million has gone missing ; despite the fact that money has been channelled into bogus research by bogus companies , some of which it appears are owned by senior members of Eurostat ; despite the fact that taxpayers ' money appears to have been channelled into staff perks -- such as a riding school and a volleyball team -- we have seen no resignations from the Commission over this issue and no acceptance of responsibility . #% At the moment , given the opportunity , I would have to vote to postpone Bulgaria 's membership , and would have to consider my position carefully with respect to Romania . #% These hearings were a resounding success for the European Parliament and hence for the people of the European Union . #% The Lisbon Council said , and I repeated this in my report , that we need to encourage a regulatory climate which is conducive to investment , innovation and entrepreneurship in general . #% If those amendments are retained the package will be severely undermined . #% Parliament , for its part , must stop demanding the impossible . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I would also like to express my thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur for the work that has been done on this . #% I do not take exception to what Tom Spencer said : I take it as a compliment when I am criticized in this respect . #% We were told that these rules were fundamental to making the euro work , the Commission is being forced into this drastic action and the wrangle is set to go on for a great deal longer . #% We simply want to make certain that the lessons with regard to internal discipline are learned as effectively as some others . #% Mr President , as the first speaker from my group , I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur on behalf of all my colleagues who work closely with him . #% The effect of the Charter will be steady and gradual rather than sudden and revolutionary . #% Organisations of disabled people and disabled people ' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making . #% Will the Council confirm , positively and definitely , that it will not allow Turkey to blackmail the EU in this way ? #% I would like to begin on a positive note . #% I shall take some examples from my own country , the United Kingdom . #% My Group will support the report put forward by Mr Brinkhorst , the rapporteur , to postpone discharge . #% Ironically , descendants of Mussolini are not only allowed to live in Italy but one actually sits in the Italian Parliament . #% So it is a pity that a number of things prevented that potential from being fully realised . #% Unilateralism without any logic whatsoever is unforgivable . #% It does not need the opprobrium that will come from world opinion if it makes a mess of its democratic processes , its independent judiciary and its freedom of speech . #% 
However , reform of the EU budget is essential . #% You have honoured your monetary reference values only in the breach , and in 26 out of 41 months you have allowed inflation to exceed your target range . #% So we need broader thinking to develop the transatlantic partnership before 2004 . #% We have to find an economic path that does not strip the world of its natural resources and produce toxic or greenhouse emissions . #% It is clear that what is a United Kingdom tragedy one day could easily occur in another country 's territory on another day . #% We must assert our fundamental role in that legislative process . #% Article 1 ( b ) of the relevant Convention forbids the taking of hostages . #% The days of waiting helplessly while airlines cancelled , delayed and overbooked flights will soon be over . #% There are dozens more such irrelevant and interfering items of EU legislation on the stocks . #% It would be horrendous if a child were to suffer or even die because an inadequately tested product was allowed on the market ; and we have to remember that items such as toothpaste and medicated shampoos are classified as cosmetics . #% I hope you are able to do that on behalf of this Parliament . #% We all know that the EU has limited powers and limited resources , maybe even smaller resources than we would hope , to carry out work in field of health . #% It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links . #% But I say again that , if there is not fulsome follow-up to statements , whether from the Commission or Council , this negates the benefit of conclusions . #% Europe must practice what it preaches . #% Twenty million unemployed and , in the eurozone , desperately low growth rates and a complete collapse of foreign direct investment . #% I hope that the Bureau will reconsider the question of security and try to fine-tune it somewhat , because far too many Members are having their visitors and other groups seriously inconvenienced by the way the rules are being applied . #% It is quite clear that if we accept this report we will fall behind the rest of the world in the development of very important treatments for cancer , diabetes , Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's disease . #% Turkey 's membership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference countries will certainly complicate the CFSP . #% Similarly the references to HACCP in Amendment No 9 are permissive and not mandatory , and the small business sector can live with that . #% It is a much-needed and longoverdue review of this area of legislation . #% After all , this is a country which , like all EU countries , enjoys membership of the Council of Europe and is part of our eastern EU partnership . #% The causes are clear , the actions required are clear . #% Given the preparation of the Commission green paper on the European public prosecutor , the run-up to the IGC in 2004 and the fact that several committees of this House were not consulted , I would ask that this report be referred back to committee . #% One of the things that singles out the European Union 's approach to the Middle East is this conjunction of democracy and human rights . #% I know we should not do so , but there is that link between the two which makes me want to comment on both . #% The way in which the whole Commission proposal is written is very patchy and it is very timid . #% This is just too much micromanagement . #% We know that it will be impossible to maintain the military pressure in those circumstances indefinitely , and we know therefore that once the threat diminishes Saddam Hussein will be back to his old tricks of obstructing the inspectors . #% I am aware of the difficulties of long-term unemployment in the Flanders area . #% I wonder whether Commissioner Lamy would be able to predict that other countries such as the US or Japan might be prepared to follow his excellent lead . #% At some point soon , we will have to grasp the nettle and let the REACH regime lead , as it was intended to . #% The report addresses many of the tricky issues that have faced decision-makers since the demonstrations at Seattle , Stockholm and Genoa : it could lead to greater transparency and accountability since citizens could act as both a check on decision-makers ' complete autonomy and they could be more informed of the decisions which are being taken in their name . #% Liberalisation alone will not help us reach our pretty meagre Kyoto targets . #% Sometimes that is a fair criticism , sometimes perhaps it is over-stated , but the Committee on Petitions is a very real route by which citizens can bring their complaints to this Parliament and have them fully and properly addressed . #% There are all those areas that have to be taken into consideration and not least - as has already been mentioned in the previous speech - the environment . #% So why is there a lack of action on hate crimes when Member States can agree criminal penalties for pollution crimes ? #% I hear of enterprises in the UK already offering solutions to the date challenge . #% It is going to be very difficult to get this proposal through , but you have the backing of our committee . #% The second problem seems to be that we will delay the new system of own resources by not voting the SAB through in its entirety tomorrow . #% You said earlier that you wanted Europe to do what it was set up to do . #% I note that on the schedule this resolution was entitled ` Future of Europe ' whereas the actual resolution is entitled ` 60th Anniversary of the end of the Second World War on 8 May 1945 ' . #% For my part , taxation is sacrosanct to each Member State . #% I would refer just to one of them and that is the requirement that when an error has been made the official concerned has to apologise to the citizen who has suffered as a result . #% The ALDE Group fully supports close cooperation in this area but it must respect fundamental rights , including privacy , and be progressed within a democratic and transparent framework . #% Also , it is worth mentioning that we look with approval upon the work that was done in terms of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets with regard to the tobacco subsidies . #% Perhaps one of the major shortcomings of the Paper is its insufficient awareness of the broader international trade context , under which , unfortunately , some of its proposals would have questionable legality . #% We do not want these glorious resolutions passed at the end of summit meetings . #% I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Cederschi√∂ld on her excellent report and the recommendations contained therein . #% My delegation strongly supports the enlargement process although as part of the institutional reform process designed to bring about our declared goal of a wider , looser Europe and an unwinding of the CAP and CFP . #% Mr President , I was glad to receive the Official Journal last night and to see that even it is trying to collaborate with the Commission . #% This scheme is hampered by the origins of Member States , many of whose former colonies produce bananas and whom they now rightly wish to assist . #% He has shown that . #% If that is not available then a family , perhaps with a different background , within its own country . #% That should be our task , not political posturing . #% So reform has much further to travel before the Convention will be satisfied that we have grappled satisfactorily with all the important questions . #% However , we could not support any text welcoming the efforts of international fellow-travellers of the so-called Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament such as the ` Parliamentary Network on Nuclear Disarmament ' ( Recital E ) . #% We could be unblocking the Council 's veto on the poverty programme to explore new initiatives which address housing needs alongside the need for sustainable urban and rural development , skill training and employment . #% If there is no freedom of the press , if people can not even get satellite dishes because imports of those have now been banned , then there are no circumstances for free and fair elections whatsoever . #% I want to talk about design standards because this is important . #% Finally , to Mr Khanbhai , it is no good claiming that you are seeking consensus , including NGOs for example , and then putting forward your Amendment No 1 , opposing a reduction in patent protection . #% The aim of the Committee on Petitions itself is to provide a good and effective service for individuals within the European Union and for civil society generally . #% The rapporteur has worked very hard to bring us together on this issue and I would commend the work he has done to the House . #% Firstly , has the British farmer been discriminated against by the present British Government , as I believe it has , with its suggestion that it has to take British beef off the bone ? #% I have to say to speakers on the other side of the House that a declaration or non-declaration of war is an irrelevancy under the Geneva Conventions . #% Can I go back to the Isle of Wight and tell the people that the new Interreg proposals will help islands like theirs ? #% 
At the end of the day , Mr Lukashenko should be considered a pariah in the West and travel bans and financial assets must be tightened up on all the members of the regime : they must be frozen . #% The primary reason for this directive is not to control atmospheric pollution itself as we inhale it but to actually reduce the effect that sulphur dioxide has on advanced catalytic systems . #% There are no one-size-fits-all solutions , but , as they say in the X-Files : the truth is out there ! #% We must have the opportunity for members from every Member State to be able to vote on these reports and on these important amendments . #% This is a parliament of political parties . #% With particular reference to my country , I call upon Prime Minister Blair to allow the British people a say through a referendum on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference . #% Commissioner , I now look forward very much to seeing actions intended to match the ambition which I see . #% Finally , we look forward to structures that will allow us to address genuine areas of need wherever they may be located . #% To be credible at that sustainability summit , we also need to demonstrate that we understand the importance of development and its link to certain aspects of immigration policy . #% While I was there I was struck by the number of people who came up to me quite spontaneously to thank me and others in our delegation for the work the European Union had done in preserving and developing democracy in Chile during the years of the dictatorship . #% I hope the social partners will make that clear . #% That is a significant difference in terms of how the insurance companies have to respond . #% We must ensure that Member States ' provisions already existing under the Geneva Convention exclude persons who have been involved in terrorist activities , crimes against humanity or other similar offences which are already clearly defined . #% Democracy at local and international levels counts for nothing if we can not achieve democracy at European level and ultimately , Mr Tsatsos , I presume the challenge will be at world level . #% I hope that the Commission will bear in mind that it will come up against the law of diminishing returns if it tries to regulate even further in this sector . #% It had particular relevance for the EU since it was the impetus for the recent Commission communication -- for which I am currently rapporteur -- on reinvigorating human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners . #% It is therefore essential that this money is very carefully targeted and monitored to ensure that it is used to bring about the necessary reforms to enable the country to become self-sustaining . #% Yes , it will take three years to influence the revision of the guidelines , but that major progress which was resisted for so long by the Council should be welcomed by us all . #% author . - Madam President , Pakistan 's inability to develop a strong and enduring democracy has impacted - quite severely , in my view - on religious freedom in that country . #% This approach misses the point . #% I am not entirely sure whether the principles of brevity and crispness have been fully respected in our own resolution , but this is certainly something we hope you will follow in Doha . #% In particular , problems of sulphur , sometimes SO2 and of course nitrous oxides , NOx , in our atmosphere that originate from the burning of a variety of dirty fuels in factories , motor cars and from other sources such as ships . #% However , I would warn her with the Latin phrase ` Timeo Danaos et dona ferentis ' which means : Fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts . #% However , as The Times stated on 7 March , in Bush 's folly , tariff walls would amount to an own goal . #% But we should not be afraid to speak out against this outrageous bill , because it is clearly a draconian and hugely disproportionate piece of legislation . #% I will finish as I began by congratulating Mr Santini but by expressing regret that , by broadening the scope and going far beyond that which we can achieve in the House , we are actually urging the Council not to accept our recommendations . #% MEPs should instead have looked forward to our joint task to seek the swiftest possible end to conflict with the minimum of casualties , to humanitarian assistance for the Iraqi people and to plans for the rebuilding of the country under the firm auspices of the United Nations . #% We can not deny that nuclear proliferation is being exposed and stopped , that the Greek seamen have been returned to their own country or that the President has once again confirmed that he will cease to be the chief of the army . #% As we have heard , we have the motiveless murder of an innocent man . #% Mr President , yesterday was Holocaust Day in Israel . #% Mr President , let me begin by congratulating our colleague Mr De Rossa on his work on this report and welcoming both the directive and the parallel statute for cooperatives . #% This system should not be supported . #% Every effort must be made , in particular by the Romanians , to maintain this momentum . #% Because of this , we will abstain on this report . #% There is no place for caged beds or anything like them in a modern psychiatric service . #% I can do even better than that : I could invite you to the Oval to watch a test match . #% In our strong resolution , thoroughly approved by the MDC representatives we have seen today , we condemn Mugabe and his regime and call for suspension of EU assistance directed through Zimbabwe government channels , identification of Mugabe 's extensive overseas assets , invocation of the Cotonou Article 96 procedures and insistence that the Zimbabwean government respect its own laws . #% I hope that is not true and that those Members who return to the new Parliament will again have the pleasure of working with him . #% The survivors still wait for justice : compensation and medical assistance in many cases . #% The institutions have come together . #% There are practical steps now to be taken . #% I know that this week there has been quite considerable media interest in these particular programmes . #% The common position is so vague on these issues that there is little point in trying to limit working time on that basis . #% In the resolution we have considered all the points which are important for the future . #% At a time when enlargement of the Union is a priority - and we have large-scale pre-accession aid programmes to assist this process - it is essential that we have the right number of staff with the right qualifications delivering and monitoring this assistance . #% It is disgraceful that this case is dragging on in the way that it is . #% Madam President , I would like to make three remarks on this excellent report by my colleague . #% I understand that she has concerns about some of the deficiencies in management of the programme . #% Similarly , they do not want European Union involvement in military matters , complicating and duplicating Nato and creating additional tensions with our vital transatlantic allies . #% This is a first step towards greater transparency in both the European Parliament and Commission . #% I very much hope the Commission will respond positively now . #% As the last speaker on behalf of Parliament I ought to reiterate some basic points . #% When he spoke he referred to the need to reform the social model . #% Will the Commissioner be considering instituting a financial instrument that will overcome the problem he clearly sees as needing to be addressed ? #% Literally thousands of lives were lost before the basic , fundamental , and in some cases outrageous shortcomings in ferry design and operations were addressed , despite repeated warnings from the unions , consumer groups and indeed this Parliament . #% This week we have had to decide how we distribute talent amongst the Members . #% Indeed , in my case , the last time we met and I had one or two things to say , Parliament imposed the maximum possible fine ! #% This House should be more concerned if it went to bed worried that it had done too much , than if it woke up finding it had done too little . #% It has been a very interesting journey and I just hope that the people in the gallery do not think we spend all our time talking about these boring technical subjects . #% I personally have come across a Nigerian asylum seeker being granted asylum on the strength of a false Liberian passport , an Albanian family who passed themselves off as Kosovans , another Nigerian who had loaned his British passport to his cousin who was able to enter the United Kingdom under the identity of his cousin and then commit a crime , and an Algerian who was living under the identity of a French citizen and who had bought his ID card on the Parisian black market . #% Madam President , I draw your attention to Annex III of the Rules of Procedure which lays down the guidelines and general principles to be followed when choosing the subjects to be included on the agenda for topical and urgent debates of major importance . #% If Parliament wants to go down the cul-de-sac to the Court of Justice , let Parliament prove itself foolish . #% A number of honourable Members have expressed a wish for a more active role for the European Parliament in the EU 's annual report on human rights . #% This is unacceptable and the proceedings should be dropped immediately . #% For instance , 19 people are being prosecuted for insulting state officials because they attended a conference at which victims who had suffered torture in the form of rape in custody spoke out against their tormenters . #% First of all the recital that we proposed focuses very much on the importance of active safety measures , working with passive safety measures , in delivering the overall safety improvements that we want . #% 
It has that written into its regulations . #% It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp human trafficking out . #% We must recognise that governments do not create productive jobs or raise living standards . #% They are not divisible , they are not negotiable and they are not applicable only to certain groups . #% Far be it from me to interfere in French internal politics - I am not a Muslim , indeed I am not a follower of any religion - but my belief is that this would not address the challenge that France faces in integrating Muslims and other minorities into its society . #% My second point concerns the relationship with Parliament . #% The UK Presidency is trying to use this Parliament to implement a policy that has already been rejected by the UK Parliament . #% Instead of Member States having to work to achieve these `` as far as possible '' , which was the original proposal , we have insisted that effective measures shall be taken unless the targets can not be achieved by `` proportionate measures '' . #% Madam President , I would like to make an appeal to the House about the de Br√©mond d'Ars report because this is an issue where we have a major dispute with the European Commission . #% We need to move our focus away from simply developing legislation to looking at how it is implemented and where it is achieving the objectives that we set out . #% We should expect Ukraine to take action . #% The honourable Member is correct in stating that the proposed amnesty law , which is still only a proposal before both the Serbian Parliament and the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , will not cover anyone convicted of offences considered to be acts of terrorism . #% Asylum obligations are clearly set out under international conventions which all Member States have individually signed up to . #% They are in desperation , forced to take out loans with high interest rates , and that increases their difficulties . #% Let me concentrate on one issue . #% The OSCE mission must be allowed to stay as an aid to that process , just as the Russians are in Kosovo . #% The terms of reference were clearly defined and I believe that it was crucial for a Member of this Parliament to be there from the very beginning . #% It is also vital that trade unions inform people of their rights under anti-discrimination legislation . #% Nonetheless , he has handled it very well and we are making a lot of progress . #% I would like to draw people 's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism . #% Thirdly , we should somehow link all the different organizations in the country . #% In both Fiji and the Solomon Islands democratic government and law and order have been undermined . #% One can only speculate at just how much of a commitment Mr Bangemann had to the level playing field in this aspect of the internal market when he is willing to sell his knowledge to Telef√≥nica , a major player in the European Union and further afield . #% I want to start firstly by thanking very much all the shadows who worked on this report for their very active involvement and our ability to find a common negotiating position and act as something of a team . #% It is a real insult to the only directly-elected democratic institution at European level . #% I too now call for Corporal Shalit 's immediate release . #% Therefore , our number one priority on Kaliningrad is to guarantee the sovereignty of the Lithuanian State and its ability to enter Schengen . #% Concerns have rightly been raised about the access for individuals to redress and compensation . #% Secondly , in preparation for enlargement , whatever language regime we choose , preparations must be made to enable citizens of the applicant countries to petition this Parliament in their own language . #% We believe that issues of international human rights violations should not be dealt with by the International Criminal Court but should be convened by UN ad hoc Tribunals . #% We must encourage people to use the technology and stop being their nannies . #% USD1 .55 billion are owing , which is approximately two-thirds of the total UN budget . #% Substantial counterfeiting will engender the severe risk of global damage to the whole credibility of , and confidence in , the euro . #% Could the President-in-Office explain to us the role of the Monetary Committee here ? #% In conclusion , this is a very important step forward for the single market . #% We have had 2.5 million cattle slaughtered in Britain ; we have had to submit about 2 000 pages of documentation on how the disease has been combated , although not yet eradicated , in our country . #% The presence of landmines and UXOs - unexploded ordnance - are a major obstacle to economic and social regeneration . #% In Cambodia you go to prison , hence the reason why some of these individuals have been imprisoned . #% In our efforts to control those frontiers and stop supplies of drugs and weapons , we must not make a barrier between our wealthier 25 countries and the poorer states just outside those new frontiers . #% However , I hope that the countries of the Union will not use this as an excuse , if it is passed , but seek to implement the new system as rapidly as they can - in other words , two years should be regarded as an exception and as a maximum rather than as the normal ration for the job . #% It is worthwhile reminding colleagues throughout the House who are working on legal texts that this is a principle that we all need to bear in mind when we are amending legislative texts of any kind . #% The new changing circumstances that we face must not be allowed to be a repetition of that experience , but rather a window in which we evolve our industry . #% It should be recognised that it gives us tremendous opportunities for tackling pollution and reducing resource depletion and gives us opportunities in the food sector to improve the output from our agricultural industries . #% The UK Government tells us it does not provide a UK view because it was felt to be ` inappropriate ' given that the UK would be holding the presidency of the Council . #% Do not simply take my word for it - I am quoting verbatim from the Turco judgment of the Court of Justice . #% Some people have already forgotten that , but the farmers and communities that went through that terrible time have certainly not forgotten it and many are only now beginning to put their lives back together again . #% The Human Rights Agency , which I hope will be set up soon , should monitor and evaluate against the standards in the Treaties . #% Let us be clear about this , our moral authority might be a little stronger if we did not also have weapons of mass destruction . #% We know that the Commission is due to review the mutual recognition directive in 2011 . #% Communication links with the outside world have been severed and , hidden from public scrutiny , the risk of further abuse escalates , according to Amnesty International . #% The US Federal Reserve , the Bank of Japan , Sweden ' s Riksbank , the Bank of England all publish the individual votes of the committee that decides interest rates . #% I was very pleased that the Commissioner mentioned that in her speech in Rome closing the European Year . #% For some time , many of us in this House have been campaigning for the EU to declare Hizbollah a terrorist organisation . #% I will be very interested to hear what Mr Frattini would like to say on that particular point in his summing-up . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , firstly , I would like to congratulate Ms Lulling on this report : she made a valiant effort . #% It would be nice , Mr President-in-Office , if you could show , when you are in Washington with the Commission , that we can make a real step forward in EU-US relations . #% That would obviously be a major gateway of access for many Internet users . #% Mr President , a French-owned company is able to sell electricity to the British Prime Minister . #% These are matters on which Mexican representatives have every right to raise their voices and I , for one , would hope that they would meet with a sympathetic response in Europe . #% I am grateful to the honourable Member because he provides me with an opportunity to further spell out the Commission 's approach . #% We feel that consumers may well be very confused about exactly what the European Union is proposing and how it will impact on them and on the food that they eat and the labels that they read . #% Everyone in Colombia agrees that the military is guilty of massive human rights violations , while , in the interests of securing their own profits , the European oil companies are said to acquiesce . #% Its work needs to flourish and be reinforced in the ways indicated in the report , because the Assembly forms the very democratic foundations of the ACP-EU partnership . #% Madam President , I should like to talk about two matters : first , in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group on various transport matters ; secondly , as shadow rapporteur on the other institutions . #% This report demonstrates that the massive urbanisation in several regions of Spain has been carried out in a way which abuses property rights , degrades the environment , undermines water provision and quality , and often leaves victims bereft of any redress or compensation when they may have lost their life savings . #% Yet those enforcing the no-fly zones have themselves come under constant attack . #% 
It is quite fitting that the last achievement of the Blair presidency was the annulment of the Poverty 4 Programme . #% But to judge from the evidence given by the UK Member of the joint supervisory body to the House of Lords European Select Committee , we have reason to ask if we can have total confidence in the thoroughness with which the joint supervisory authority is doing its job . #% Firstly , for British farmers , voluntary modulation would be anything but voluntary - they would be forced to accept a cut of up to 20 % of the value of their single farm payment , while the rest of Europe 's farmers would not . #% Would the Commissioner confirm that this is essentially a crisis of movement ? #% We need bold , imaginative action plans and we need them now . #% Could you reconfirm that you would give equal weight to other minority languages -- by which I mean cultures -- throughout the whole of the European Union , including the ten new Member States ? #% Mr President , I came into the Chamber to vote against this report as a protest against the misleading and inaccurate comments made by Mrs McKenna in relation to the management of the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in the United Kingdom . #% The Commission , when it works at its best , is the one to do it . #% This is clearly an issue that affects an increasing number of our citizens and that we have to address , but it is not a simple issue . #% I congratulate Commissioner Verheugen and his team because they have played a key part in brokering the package . #% We must provide the means from the European Union to try and find a peaceful solution to the current conflict , and the finance to help rebuild the economy , in particular in the rural areas . #% We must find a way because we can not afford to lose the reforms contained in this Constitution . #% There is a need for greater acknowledgement of social objectives in the development and reform process , be it in Russia , Indonesia or elsewhere . #% So that is the ultimate resort , should this legislation fail . #% In view of the fact that numerous countries in the world with which the European Union has cooperative agreements and close economic relations have much worse human rights records than Cuba , would the Commissioner agree that there can be no justification for rejecting a Cuban agreement on these grounds , although we will continue to raise the issues in question ? #% At what political level was the Commission represented on this committee ? #% All of these things and many others are to be welcomed . #% The exceptions are therefore discretionary , not mandatory . #% In 1994 the figure had fallen to just 14 % . #% I do not think indefinite subsidy is a solution . #% So I would be interested in the Commissioner 's views on making sure that there is uniform application and ensuring that the system is implemented properly throughout the Union on these vessels . #% In this Parliament yesterday the British Socialists ... #% In the UK we are the largest manufacturer - and indeed consumer - of health supplements of one kind or another , vitamin and mineral supplements to the diet . #% I hope you will not mind if I mention that tonight even though it is not part of our question . #% Against this background the EPLP is appalled and disappointed that the Migu√©lez Ramos report before us threatens to increase shark finning . #% I draw attention to Amendments Nos 33 to 35 , which I authored , on equal access to legal proceedings , participation in local life and voting rights , but I should immediately state that the new ELDR Amendment No 56 is intended to replace Amendment No 34 , in order to clarify that it means participation in local community life , for instance in neighbourhood forums , and that Amendment No 35 is only aspirational in encouraging Member States to give local and European voting rights . #% This is a team effort and it is a team effort that we need to endorse and encourage . #% However , the general procedures for interoperability must not be defined by a hard case . #% I said that we are resubmitting some : we are not resubmitting all the amendments that failed in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , because it was rather pointless . #% The lessons can be found in those resolutions that we see tonight . #% I find it inconceivable that the US with Boeing should totally dominate the world market for medium - and larger-scale aircraft . #% The first major problem was that the supreme audit institutions of the Member States feared that somehow or other this was a takeover by the European Court of Auditors . #% We could probably reduce the chemical use on these crops by even more than 50 % , but , of course , we have closed our minds and our ears to the whole debate and , again , we are going to reduce the competitivity of European agriculture . #% What possible motive could there be for this ? #% Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ? #% Unlike my colleague , I am delighted that you are not proposing any further legislation today . #% In the past this has been left more to the opinion of Member States and there has not been any set of clear criteria which people can understand . #% Sustainability : yes , we have taken notice of it , but we are allowing trawlers in . #% Secondly , should his immunity be lifted in such a way that he can face a German court . #% It is of fundamental importance to ordinary people across Europe that they are free to elect the people who set their taxes . #% The report will certainly give Parliament a good starting point for negotiations with the Council , which I welcome . #% We suspect that the same thing will happen with the national emissions ceiling directive . #% Therefore we have a collective responsibility to ensure this issue receives the attention it deserves from Parliament , the Commission , the Council and society as a whole . #% It is one of the patient-safety issues on our agenda and was rightly put there during the British Presidency . #% I therefore support the call for a legal basis that will put our powers on a par with those of the very important international sports organisations . #% We represent all the citizens of Europe not just those who are organised in NGOs . #% I shall continue to do so because I see this as a dangerous precedent , opening the door to a Europe of the regions by stealth - something I totally reject . #% Mr President , the assassination of the Hamas chief had one effect , which was that the Arab League summit , which was to have taken place yesterday and today , was cancelled . #% Millions become ill each year in work-related illnesses and this report will have a direct effect on reducing that industrial carnage and misery . #% Yet the picture is mixed : elephant numbers are recovering in some areas , but this causes the destruction of the natural habitat . #% For example , Paragraph 60 onwards of the Presidency Conclusions mentioned promoting sustainable development on a global scale . #% It also means basing any guidance from the Commission to Member States about consumer protection on real documented problems , not on imagined ones . #% I am of the view that , given the fact that the EU is the largest donor to the reconstruction of this country , to the tune of over EUR 1 billion , we should make aid conditional on the cessation of these unacceptable practices . #% In Sweden it is estimated that environmental legislation in their country puts one Swedish kroner per kilogram onto the price of meat . #% I now turn briefly to the proposals for non-resident carriers operating national road passenger transport . #% In that case it may be rather odd that her report had a rather rocky ride within the committee and that a large number of people voted against it . #% Patience must be shown with some Member States that are starting from scratch and have very little infrastructure for recycling . #% There is no evidence that Member States , when they agreed the common position , were unmindful of their health and safety responsibilities . #% He can afford to be fascinated : it is not his country 's freedoms , liberty and democracy that are being dismantled and abolished in that process of integration . #% Taking the latter point first , I argue in the way I do because existing legislation no longer meets the consumers ' needs . #% As the honourable Member underlines , the system that we are seeking to develop in the European Commission does not yet bear any comparison with arrangements that have existed in Sweden , and indeed in some other Member States , for some years . #% It would be extremely counterproductive to bury business in yet more red tape , notwithstanding the need for efficient scrutiny of how money is spent and how effective the programme is proving to be . #% I welcome this Charter . #% It was apparent that the Helms-Burton Act causes a great deal of anxiety among certain members of Congress . #% Similarly , the GSP schemes should be given proper teeth and be enforceable . #% Will he take up through the appropriate channels the serious bureaucratic delays occasioned by the United Nations Sanctions Committee and also the exclusion of a large number of items , including things like microscopes , eye glasses , spatulas , thermometers and vaseline , which can not be considered as military supplies and are hitting the most vulnerable sections of the population , not Saddam Hussein and his particular clientele ? #% 
This has been explicitly admitted by government ministers at a national government level and is something against which we must take a stand as a parliament . #% If these amendments are adopted by Parliament , the ELDR will vote against the proposal as a whole . #% In relation to the dimensions ; we have had an enormous lobby in this European Parliament from the organizations representing the blind , who want to be able to clearly differentiate between one denomination of a coin and another . #% We notice that the Council is in its place in order to take part in Council questions . #% Do we want to ignore the objections of news organisations like Handelsblatt , Reuters , Agence France Press and the Financial Times , all of which live by their high reputations ? #% Does the Commission intend to offer commensurate funds for the other work -- the self-led development work -- of the AU on democracy , human rights and good governance ? #% Our main goals are to ensure higher levels of safety whilst fully integrating our European rail system . #% We take international action to try to protect the citizens of other Member States , for instance in the Balkans , but we will not have any joint action to protect our own citizens . #% Diverse and balanced information must be free of propaganda ; but the people of all countries are crying out for information and explanation of what the EU is doing . #% I would like to thank Commissioner Flynn for his reply . #% I believe the Commissioner will be able to confirm that the building was bought for USD 0.5 million , refurbished to the tune of USD 2.2 million - that is four times what it was bought for - whilst renting somewhere else for about USD 18 000 per month which was cheaper than where the Commission 's residence was beforehand because I believe it was in the Four Seasons Hotel . #% That is what these two reports do brilliantly . #% As the EU increasingly focuses it attention on employment , largely under the auspices of the Lisbon Strategy , the call for a bottom-up approach is most welcome . #% However , in commenting on the Commission 's Green Paper I believe it is our task to pose questions and to point directions rather than to deal with it as if it were legislation . #% I know you will look into this . #% With the absence of Europol , unsavoury citizens of the EU , like big-time criminals , child pornographers , paedophiles and drug barons , seem to have the liberty to cruise as pirates and buccaneers throughout the single European market . #% The EU economic crisis reveals that the EU has , as it were , no bathing costume . #% in writing . - I was disappointed to have to abstain on this report , which should have followed up on the Commission 's Green Paper in looking at how farmers across Europe get the maximum benefit in the marketplace from the high standard of their produce . #% I would be grateful , in light of this terrible rail disaster , if you would do that . #% Authoritative instructions , which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey , though contrary to the dearest convictions of his judgement and conscience , are utterly unknown to the laws of the land and against the tenor of our constitution . ' #% Hence we want to make it simpler : we want a single regulation , more understandable ways of establishing which substances are among the estimated 20 % that will need proper assessment and authorisation . #% I therefore earnestly hope that the Europe 2020 initiative , which is certainly necessary to deal with the underlying economic crisis faced by Europe , does not fail on the same basis . #% . Mr President , first of all I apologise for being breathless . #% We have to take into account national differences and indeed , social and employment concerns . #% The only reason people want to be masters of the future is to change the past . '' #% Mr President , the principle of European cooperation in defence procurement is well established . #% However , it is equally clear that the Commission 's original and rather limited proposal to set up a vets agency at Grange was overtaken by events . #% We must be careful in the messages that we send out , not only to the aviation industry , which contributes greatly to all our countries ' economies , but also to our citizens , who I believe have the right to continue to enjoy affordable air travel , whether on business or for pleasure . #% One of the things you did not mention , but which seems to me to be rather extraordinary in terms of discriminatory practice , is that some Member States have tried to restrict access to those markets on the grounds that they do not want to encourage gambling . #% I should like to ask that he would at least take the idea back and discuss it with the President of the Commission and the Council , because I see that as one way of changing some of the misunderstandings on both sides of the Atlantic in both legislative bodies . #% Europe has a lot to offer visitors , be they from outside or from inside the European Union . #% It is therefore all the more extraordinary that 50 years after the signing of the Convention of Human Rights , which ironically was signed in Rome , and one year after the Treaty of Amsterdam upholding such rights , that one European family , which for a thousand years has been involved with the continent 's history , is being denied the fundamental rights my colleague has mentioned . #% I suggest that the message relayed by the Commissioner be sent forthwith to the traditional producers , simply to give them some encouragement and hope for the future . #% We must therefore be careful not to lose sight of our responsibilities to Central Asia simply because we wish to strengthen relations with countries adjacent to the EU to its immediate east . #% Needless to say , we are retabling those amendments and we hope that the full House will do justice to them in the vote on Wednesday . #% Whereas , in the past , there was reluctance by the EU to admit military applications , this coyness has now been dropped . #% When I criticised it at that point , his response was that ` it showed that knowledge can develop and that development sometimes leads us to question the authorisations that were given previously ' . #% The old Labour government did not opt in , and the new Lib-Dem/Con coalition government must stay opted out . #% An additional welcome measure is the standardisation of penalties , with prison sentences with a maximum term of no less than five years . #% But I understand that this single meeting in Belgrade will be followed by negotiations in Pristina within one week and that there will be weekly meetings thereafter . #% The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has now appointed a rapporteur . #% Even regions like Yorkshire , Britain ' s premier region and coincidentally the region I represent , are not known by every citizen throughout the EU . #% Mr President , I regret that the PSE Group made no attempt to contact me or my office about this proposal they were going to make . #% Mr President , there is much in the text to promote access to buses by disabled people - passenger handrails , non-slip surfaces , standards for wheelchairs and a wide definition of reduced mobility to include all disabled people . #% The visit to Middlesbrough by the North Korean football team during the 1966 World Cup and their recent return was graphically portrayed in a documentary , . #% Our President , earlier on , said that we would look at the decoration of it . #% I therefore ask what cost ? #% He has to bring a Member State into compliance . #% It might also be helpful to have an update on the concession schemes that are available and try and promote the identification and exchange of best practice . #% What it does is provide for safe use of ladders and other equipment . #% How wide , in a given national market , could these exclusive deals with the dealer networks remain ? #% Was it because Carl Linden who heads Chiquita brands began channelling $ 500 000 into the Democratic campaign during the presidential elections ? #% It will develop new sources of employment and will give assistance in the provision of services for beneficiaries . #% It is a poor country where recent droughts have posed enormous problems . #% In consequence , an EU-negotiated trade agreement is likely to be less beneficial for an individual Member State - and , I have to say , the UK in particular - than if the Member State had been able to negotiate for itself . #% We have come across the element of concealment already in the countries where this has arisen . #% With TB we need to recognise the link to AIDS -- the multi-drug resistance versions which kill two million a year . #% Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate my colleague , Annemarie Kuhn , whose last major report in Parliament this may well be . #% There is one area where we are not for the first time facing sustained opposition . #% Nothing suggests that paedophilia is more prevalent among homosexuals proportionately -- indeed it is probably the contrary . #% I believe that is evidence that people want to work legally . #% The GUE group has proposed a joint resolution with the Greens and why we are launching an appeal to members of other political groups in this Parliament and to political parties , civil associations , churches and cultural bodies throughout Europe to oppose this military escalation and to urge all EC Member States to refuse to support it . #% It is right to fight for freedom and values for all , not big jobs for the lucky few . #% Having been not so happy with him in a debate yesterday on PNR , I am very happy with him now . #% It is important that the Government of Bangladesh should take early steps to enter into negotiations with those Member States that so wish and to conclude mutually acceptable re-admission agreements . #% 
I promised you on Monday that I would report to you what happened when I finally received the letter from the General Secretary of the Labour Party , Mr Sawyer . #% That group regularly abuses the process of negotiating joint motions . #% Different parts of the textile industry will find different routes , some more technical than others , some craft-related ; some will go in other directions . #% I want to bring to Parliament 's attention the specific problem that the Committee on Petitions is still experiencing with access to documentation . #% However , the proposal to limit the availability of traditional varieties of seeds , particularly for fruit and vegetables used by amateur gardeners as well as those used commercially by smaller farms , has led to deep opposition being expressed by such well known and respected bodies as the Henry Doubleday Research Association . #% It is an infringement of the rights of British nationals , some of whom already have an EU criminal record for plane-spotting . #% The reality is that developing countries will not accept the United States ' insistence on restricting exports to those who treat only a handful of infectious diseases . #% Those who use issues of history to try and create new obstacles on our road to the accession of new Member States of the European Union must appreciate the damage that they are doing to public opinion . #% An appeal is essential , but this can only be a first step . #% It is not sufficient that we should simply say everybody is welcome , because I believe there is a limit to the matters of EU enlargement and this should be thought about now . #% Working conditions for drivers have direct economic but also safety implications . #% I do not believe we will have further debates like this - I see the Commissioner is enthusiastically agreeing with me . #% I am very pleased that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has produced an opinion to contribute its authorship to this report , because within seven years , 50 % of people with multiple sclerosis lose their jobs , even though they want to work and are capable of working . #% We should not impose a particular view on religion in the Constitution . #% I sincerely hope the report reflects the fact that it was produced not just by me but by the whole committee . #% Where the GSP is a success , a country may graduate to a new relationship with the EU . #% A lot of us have been through that already and we welcome many of the conclusions . #% Frankly , I have to say to Mr Bolkestein , if this goes through tomorrow - and I hope that we will actually have the opportunity to discuss in more detail and look at some amendments that you will accept - the fact we have come in at the end of the process has made it very difficult for those of us who want change to put forward acceptable amendments . #% Only by answering those questions as a House can we go forward to the Council and the Commission with a very strong case . #% Britain should follow the example of France and Germany and protect its own national interests and those of its domestic energy consumers . #% This is unacceptable when a territory is under the stewardship of an international community that purports to uphold human rights . #% I share Mr Adam 's view that it is a pity it has taken quite so long to sort it out . #% Nevertheless , a Hamas victory will make a land-for-peace deal much more difficult to realise . #% He is absolutely right in the report to point out , as he has done in his remarks this evening , that in order to tidy this up and create something sensible and understandable to Europe 's citizens , it is necessary for changes to come both from the forthcoming Convention and from recommendations to the IGC that might be accepted . #% There is not enough money in the European budget to pay for all the items on the shopping list , or should I say `` wish list ' , of spending proposals in this report . #% So there can be no more appropriate time for countries to be working together to confront these humanitarian challenges . #% We must guarantee that its massive oil wealth be used to build prosperity for its peoples , not for arms purchases . #% I am not convinced by what you have said today and I very much doubt whether the people in the public gallery are convinced . #% Given that only the Council can seek action from the Commission in this area , perhaps I could give an example of why there is a problem . #% The great wit , Oscar Wilde , described the English hunting fraternity as the ` unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable ' . #% I think that in the Internal Market Committee we can all be proud that we have reached a consensus on increased transparency and ways to finally eliminate the problem of bill shock . #% I think many of us in this Chamber are so pleased that you are carrying on what was started by the Commission and also followed up by the Presidency statements last autumn . #% Now we have a legal base for the programme , a budget and a plan for a European awareness campaign against violence against women . #% The World Bank claims it is merely carrying out the wishes of the 147 states which own it -- a verbal sleight of hand . #% I hope you will agree that EUR 50 000 is enough to exclude retail investors , as the larger amount will prove cumbersome even for professional investors who are used to dealing in units of EUR 10 000 . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for her assurance on the point I raised . #% Barclaycard , for example , which is one of the biggest credit card companies , has had its headquarters in the town for a very long time . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking all three rapporteurs for their reports , which I fully support . #% All of these factors must be taken into account if we are to realize a true policy for food aid and sustainability through the passing of this regulation . #% Another area which is very important and again a key industry for Europe is the aerospace industry . #% Perhaps with hindsight it might have been easier if we had rejected it some 18 months ago and started again , but we did not and I and colleagues have worked hard to present something to Parliament and to salvage something from it . #% The withdrawal has also been welcomed by the Muslim world as a first phase of a process . #% Therefore , we should debate and vote on it tomorrow ; otherwise there is a danger of obstruction by one group . #% There are already concerns that plants in Washwood Heath ( Birmingham ) , Rugby and Stafford face an unnecessary and uncertain future . #% It is particularly important to the issue of dealing with corporate and individual tax avoidance . #% Will the Commissioner confirm that if Catalan national teams competed on the same basis as Scottish and Welsh national teams , that would mean that anybody who represented a Catalan national team would be permanently ineligible to represent the Spanish national team ? #% As Mr Jarzembowski will know only too well , on port state control several Member States still do not inspect 25 % of ships . #% Yet a few clearly have darker motives . #% We see many children working in conditions of slavery and forced labour and we would urge all European Union states to ratify the ILO Convention dealing with these issues . #% Overall we welcome the changes made by Parliament on this particular report and hope that it is not too late for the Council to take account of them . #% The need for EU political leadership which was amply on display in Seattle in international trade affairs is now more acute than ever . #% I welcome the strengthening of the eight criteria agreed at the Luxembourg and Lisbon European Councils which mean that arms exports from the EU must not be used for internal repression , external aggression or supporting terrorism . #% Does he not think that it is important that drastic action should be taken immediately to prevent any further arms from being supplied from Europe and that those people who are involved in this deadly trade should be brought before the courts forthwith ? #% Having integrated many European nations ravaged by the Cold War , we must now do the same for the Western Balkans . #% I am glad to see that we are recognising the importance of involving pupils themselves in the development and assessment of our educational system . #% I am very encouraged by what I have heard so far . #% This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court . #% The second factor will be Parliament 's attitude to redeployment , especially in Category IV , not just for 2001 but for the whole of the Financial Perspective . #% That is how national parliaments should be involved , not through some new chamber of subsidiarity or some new institution . #% I welcome Mr Deprez 's report . #% It would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of what has been achieved or the considerable mindshift that is taking place among Member States in this field . #% Now there is increasing competition between ro-ro ferries and this type of transport we need to make sure that there is an equal emphasis on both these forms . #% We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality , which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry . #% That is a major achievement . #% The UK is renouncing access to funding on a principle of not applying for this fund in order to receive a rebate . #% To continue to lift people out of pockets of poverty , India 's trade reforms must complement development policies . #% 
There has been very little opposition to the principle of phasing out HCFCs and methyl bromide . #% It is logical to take this step now , for inclusive reasons , but not make it a permanent change ; to revert to the present numbers in 2009 . #% The first year has passed and there has been lots of talk and plenty of paper , but if the targets are to be met , we need to see hundreds of wells , thousands of septic tanks , tens of thousands of pipes being laid each and every month . #% In essence , these are known as automatic stays and mean that in certain countries , such as Spain , I believe all contracts are suspended automatically by an insolvency proceeding . #% It is essential that this Parliament , its committees and its delegation to the Ukraine are linked into the work of the subcommittee of the political cooperation agreement which handles energy and environment issues . #% I also welcome the ongoing commitment to the Galileo project and the review of the TENs strategy , especially with its highlight on the railway sector , a sector which we believe to be very important indeed . #% We will not always agree with criticisms , but we must always be open to them if we expect others to do the same . #% There is a contradiction here , about which I have expressed myself on a number of occasions . #% So it is clear we must do better on budgets in the future ; it is clear we must use our limited resources now wisely ; it is clear we must target the non-communicable diseases that cause 86 % of deaths in Europe and devastate lives and families - cardiovascular disease , cancer , mental illness , diabetes , respiratory and musculoskeletal conditions . #% We observe that the SYNERGY programme seems to have lost some of its priority in the Commission and we wish to see this programme continued successfully . #% I find it extraordinary that those who have profited so much from European integration in terms of prosperity , security and liberal democracy should now refuse to extend those prizes towards Turkey . #% This morning he is in what is known as a general purpose cell in Butyrsky prison where conditions are such that they must be left to your imagination . #% Perhaps greater honesty at the outset might have helped provide a more realistic atmosphere . #% Mr President , air transport is a vital growing sector with more and more people flying each year . #% So can I be recorded as having voted for that particular amendment . #% Above all , in health and safety we need to have up-to-date scientific and medical evidence to demonstrate the need for such legislation . #% I should like to request that the Commission and the Council consider supporting appropriate court cases brought by Turkish Cypriots aggrieved that they have been deprived of the franchise for the European Parliamentary elections . #% But while Mr Hannan is here in the Chamber this morning , perhaps he could give us a guarantee that he will be making a new entry in his declaration of financial interests to say where the money has come from . #% We have a European single market , but that does not overrule the fact that Member States compete against one another . #% We should not go down this road . #% I am sure they will give ample evidence of the fall in commodity prices - which have fallen by 30 % from 1998 to 1999 - and we will need to acknowledge that globalisation and liberalisation have had very mixed results . #% Inevitably , this includes reforming the common agricultural policy . #% Indeed , I just read a report in newspaper this morning that sets out details of the first round of imports of 4x4 vehicles from China , at a price that I can not see any current suppliers ever being able to match in the EU . #% The measures contained in this 3-year strategy , however , should hopefully bring manufacturers on board . #% I urge that this be looked at when the project moves on to its next phase . #% We are sure that we can maintain the necessary pace while simultaneous achieving the understanding and the support required for fully effective implementation of the essential changes . #% Your rapporteur justifiably believes that this lowering of thresholds is extremely important in obtaining these goals . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I think I should present the compliments of my group on the policy strategy that President Barroso has put forward for what , as he has said himself , will be an important and challenging year . #% As the biggest trading block , we have an important role to play . #% I know that the budget will not be easy this year , but we pick up the proposal for a ring-fenced amount of EUR 21 billion over seven years in that resolution of 8 June . #% The European Medical Control Agency has estimated that in the UK , for example , out of 207 notified substances , all but 2 or 3 would sail through the process of registration without the expensive proof required for chemicals . #% And who gave the orders for the troops to shoot innocent protestors ? #% I am glad that is the final result . #% We can be positive ; it leads to the development of infrastructure , it can help to reduce the isolation of rural communities and it offers new opportunities for vegetable growers and others in developing countries . #% For absolute clarity , I have the wording here from the original . #% The social model is not working and yet the solution seems to be that we want more of it - more regulation , more rules - and , I am afraid , economically this project is falling even further behind . #% If the 1 % level is found to be perfectly technically feasible , there are many in the Community who want to make sure that it is possible to review that level downwards , and we would like to have the Commission 's view on that . #% Is there going to be continuity ? #% At the end of this Parliament it is important that we should reaffirm our support for these people and their rights and I am proud that in my last speech here I shall be doing precisely this . #% Clearly the first element will be discussed , particularly as this House debates the report by Mrs Pack , and I therefore highlight just a few of the relevant elements at this juncture . #% Let us have total decoupling . #% It is significant that there has been no proper regulatory impact assessment at EU level to determine the costs and benefits of the proposed directive . #% Because they were not prepared to do that , they withdrew the winners of the Coca-Cola Cup , the League Cup , from UEFA 's competitions . #% I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy for their cooperation in the work on this report and on this proposal , which has enabled us to come before Parliament with a clear and united position . #% The single market requires a much more mobile workforce than we currently have . #% Finally , in the context of the WTO debates , we also need to see a guarantee of the legal right of all human beings to access to food . #% We look to you to turn these proposals into tangible ideas to achieve the objectives that we all share . #% It is our responsibility , not the responsibility of the Commission or the Council . #% Professor MacCormick will be acutely aware of this in Scotland , with its own legal heritage . #% In conclusion , I would like to say to Commissioner Bolkestein that I hope he will accept this proposal from Mr Rothley on behalf of Parliament and move as quickly as possible to bring these changes into effect in the form of further revisions to the Motor Insurance Directive . #% Apart from this complaint , I should like to thank all the services that have been a part of this very successful report . #% It is a nonsense to suggest that relief is possible as long as these armed militias continue to intimidate the refugees . #% We are in the real world now , and this is not some theoretical piece of legislation but something that will actually protect jobs in our constituencies . #% Who do you think you are kidding , Mr Van Rompuy ? #% Terrorism is inexcusable and the Palestinians ' legitimate national aspirations can not be achieved through violence . #% With such a situation , what can the European Parliament offer ? #% However , in the UK there are large numbers of students who are not aware of these opportunities and the UK is falling behind other countries in sending students abroad . #% That is not the way to build a new security framework for the new European situation . #% If I could share one brief historical fact with the House concerning my own country : the first mention of solid chocolate being sold in the UK was in 1657 when a Frenchman opened a shop in London . #% Members have highlighted the reasons why this regulation is required in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States , so I will not go any further on that point . #% I am very grateful , too , to colleagues for the interest that they have taken . #% This has been under negotiation for five years . #% Some of the rights we need as citizens are against our own governments , such as checks on our police , customs and intelligence services . #% I believe that high standards for animal welfare are good not only for chickens but also for farmers and consumers . #% Mr President , I want to place on the record of this House that during this afternoon 's discussions , particularly during the distressing scenes , Members of the British Conservative Party were seen making obscene gestures towards people in the public gallery . #% I could say a lot more , but thankfully my time is up . #% 
By all means ask for a greater proportion of structural funds to be spent on this instead of something else , but let us be realistic about not asking for more money when it is not there . #% When we say we agree to a new country joining , we will have done all the hard work so that our citizens can be assured that this is a safe accession that we can all agree to . #% Why have we have achieved so much ? #% Mr President , I would draw your attention and through you the attention of the President and the Bureau to remarks in the Belgian press attributed to one of our Members , Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre . #% With sufficient safeguards , I am sure that could be a step forward . #% The status quo here is clearly not acceptable . #% But I am also talking about the freedom of movement of services , like TV broadcasting , with implications for children in respect of advertising or programmes with adult content . #% Mr President , my colleague , Mr Titley , is absolutely right when he warns people not to use Hong Kong and Hong Kong human rights as a stick to beat China . #% However , the issue of an absolute ban on the death sentence remains a conscience-based issue for individual MEPs . #% We are concerned about potential threats to jobs . #% That is good for our citizens ; it is good for their health and it is good for their democratic rights too . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , Russia is an important partner for the EU in many respects . #% Mr President , we will never forget the attacks against the United States , which we utterly condemn . #% Mr President , it may be appropriate in my few minutes to pay tribute to the rapporteur and with her to the Commissioner who is also with us in this last but one consumer debate of this Parliament , and , indeed , to the processes of co-decision , which we have implemented and which have perhaps meant more in this field than almost any other . #% It is also the case that we are still waiting for the World Bank and the IMF to come up with something similar to the European Union . #% To add to the confusion and waste , European allies are now toying with two separate sets of military capability improvements : those for NATO and those for the European Union . #% It is also the case that the charities are receiving different advice from government inspectors about the provision of services and the necessary technical standards of equipment from that which pertains in state orphanages . #% All the focus seems to be on labour markets . #% Mr President , Parliament 's Committee on the Environment is increasingly concerned that we are adopting European environmental legislation and then neglecting to implement it properly . #% It might be disproportionate to any political benefit which accrued , and equally we have a sense that underlying Amendment No 12 is the idea that contacts between Members and third parties or interest groups is something so suspicious , so intrinsically shabby almost , that it needs to be monitored and controlled as tightly as possible . #% For anyone suffering from an allergy , it is no good saying that it is only an insignificant percentage of people who have it . #% The enemies of democracy will exploit these divisions for their own purposes . #% We often talk about the importance of the role of women , but there can be no starker an example than this of the damage that occurs when women are powerless . #% Another aspect of the Committee 's second reading report which should be stressed is the need to make sure that the dissemination of environmental information keeps up with modern means of communication technology . #% Others have turned to non-state players . #% Here Members of the European Parliament from Germany , Spain , Belgium and Italy joined with colleagues from China , Japan , Korea and the Philippines to agree that Kyoto needs to be ratified ; the UN must be the basis of the global war against terrorism ; positive action is required to address discrimination against women ; we should work with trade unions and other representatives of civil society to combat child labour . #% We will also hold the Commission to account on the promises President Barroso has made to Parliament today , not least in relation to human rights . #% Mr President , I stand 150 % behind the Council and Commission 's wise decision to freeze all direct budgetary aid to the Palestinian Authority led by an unreformed Hamas . #% It is not clear whether the internal market will be underpinned by health , safety and employment standards , as it is in the EU . #% You legitimately need some control over their actions . #% Mr Corbett , am I right on this point ? #% The honourable Member mentioned protecting the secular character of the European Union , and , in its response , the Council referred to the position in Turkey , where there is a separation of church and state . #% We need a new-generation air traffic management system for Europe to improve air transport safety and environmental performance . #% That did not stop us joining this club together . #% Mr Barroso , every time I predict that another country is on the verge of a bail-out you say , ` no no , there is no problem ' . #% South African NGOs are going to the wall . #% We do not however agree with paragraph 24 of the resolution as we believe that any proposal for improvement of EU disaster response should be made with full consultation and deliberation , and not simply in the context and immediate aftermath of one humanitarian tragedy , however appalling . #% Is that not a sign of what is to come ? #% Europe can surely do better than that . #% It concerns a reference made yesterday by the President on the change of business which is taking place this week . #% Mr Chichester asks how the Council and Commission will react to developments in the world energy market and how supplies will be secured : it is the right question , but it has been put to the wrong people . #% With the emphasis in the CAP on giving increasing importance to rural development schemes , it is crucial to recognise the young farmers as the key players and main executives responsible for the implementation of such new rural redevelopment policies . #% Opportunities have been missed again . #% Has Mrs Honeyball consulted Mr Brown , I wonder ? #% This would have an enormous impact on maximising the positive effects of transport policy on health . #% In the spirit of seeking maximum support for European and international cooperation for the reconstruction of Iraq , its return to peace and stability and for the full observance of human rights and democracy for its people , we have not sought to amend the wording which commanded all-party support in the Foreign Affairs Committee . #% What timescale would he recommend ? #% Nor can we preach about free trade when we continue to hand out subsidies to our farmers which artificially depress the prices of commodities such as cotton . #% The zoonoses regulations to which Mrs Paulsen has devoted so much time are in a way the building blocks of the provision of an effective and precautionary food law for the future . #% However , I think that in the past , far too much responsibility has been put on gaming companies and not enough on individuals . #% Otherwise we support Mr van Velzen 's report and commend it to you . #% I , as a taxpayer , would like to know what are we spending our money on in that case . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for staying to answer the question . #% We want fair prices for farmers in all developing countries . #% Six-monthly stop and start policies often do not work when we need long-term planning and reform . #% What is not acceptable is that this government still refuses to accept they got it wrong and still refuses to apologise to those who suffered . #% Could the EU and the Commission do more ? #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bullmann report shows that economies of countries which have not yet adopted the euro are performing better than those who have . #% However , we believe there is still much work to be done . #% The Commission takes the view that the risk associated with transportation of radioactive material is low but that efforts should be made to inform the public and the emergency services of the safety of the transportation process . #% We must therefore continue to ensure that we can effect change in the 77 developing countries concerned . #% We also welcome any sensible measures that promote the environment and the fight against global poverty . #% The nitrates directive was probably flawed from the beginning and all but two countries , Denmark and Sweden of course , are now before the European Court of Justice because of their failure to implement it . #% Free movement of goods and services between countries with vastly differing levels of wealth is a plain different thing to the free movement of peoples . #% But what they need more than anything is time - time to adjust to a very competitive market ; in some cases it will take at least five years and in other cases it will take a far longer period until they can compete with dollar-banana producers . #% Mr President , first of all , as PPE-DE shadow rapporteur , let me congratulate my Socialist colleague , Mr Berenguer Fuster , on an excellent piece of work which has achieved a remarkable degree of cross-party consensus within Parliament and the committee . #% 
Mr President , eyes have understandably been on the slaughter in Lebanon . #% The Progress Report 2010 is a reasonably balanced document and I have voted in favour of it in spite of a number of reservations - not least over the Cyprus issue , where I much regret that the amendments calling for fulfilment of the EU Council 's promise to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus were voted down . #% Secondly , we need in this Parliament to be much more aware of the need to monitor international obligations , in particular since no reference has been made here today to the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement and its agricultural trade protocols . #% Mr President , many congratulations to the rapporteur . #% Our concerns therefore relate to a number of things : to the cost , of course ; but more importantly , does not this proliferation of agencies undermine the executive role of the European Commission ? #% They have ordered an end to the unannounced visits by the IAEA inspectors . #% But we hope all of this will not be necessary and we hope that Pakistan can still come back from the brink , that the state of emergency can be withdrawn and that General Musharraf will step down as Chief of Army . #% Firstly , whilst I welcome the commitment in the communication to appeal to European enterprises to do more to respect human rights , reflected in paragraphs 55 and 92 of our resolution , I have to say to the Commission that I am disappointed that the Relex DGs appear to have opted out of the draft Green Paper on Corporate Social Responsibility . #% The Colchester-based 16 Air Assault Brigade is also very much in the front line of the conflict , along with units from all over the United Kingdom . #% The Committee on Regional Development wishes accordingly to stress the importance of widespread consultation at all stages of the legislative process , including the preparation of impact assessments to allow national , regional and local variations to be taken into account . #% I very much hope , therefore , that the people who have put forward this amendment will withdraw it , and that discussions will take place in an appropriate place . #% Certainly we want to ensure that this new system is used to assist the most vulnerable in our society . #% Mr Bolkestein has on many occasions -- both to the committee and to this House -- indicated that he could not look at past regimes : he could only rule if current law was compatible . #% Mr President , Commissioner , I especially welcome paragraph 20 on additionality and hope very much that the Commission will take particular account of the importance of transparency . #% The US is more successful at getting its long-term unemployed back into work . #% The lack of a conclusion so far certainly means that the complainant is left in limbo , not quite understanding what it means when elected Members can come to one conclusion and the Commission another . #% By extending the benefits of EU membership to those countries that are eligible under Article 49 , we hope to see develop the looser , more flexible Europe in which we believe as a group . #% It must first be said that we are not through the crisis yet and that the authorities can not relax in the thought that it will pass . #% Is he aware that one British airline executive admitted that duty-free is equivalent to an ECU 21 subsidy per passenger on charter flights ? #% I believe that any confident central bank would welcome the opportunity for its members to be challenged on the fundamental assumptions underlying their decisions . #% I think we are all aware of this danger of the dispersal of EU assistance in far-flung places . #% I have no doubt that women journalists are also under pressure in the written media . #% I also look forward to more people , even from the island of the United Kingdom who have the habit of driving on the wrong side of the road , driving even further on the continent of Europe . #% We certainly do not wish to obstruct it or vote against the conciliation procedure , but we feel , on this side of the House , that the principles that led us to vote against this last time - and my colleague , Mr R√ºbig , who will speak later , is a veteran of the previous process - are entirely consistent . #% So we are examining the possibility of legislation as soon as the Treaty is ratified . #% Mr President , I find it somewhat ironic that all of the men who have spoken on the other side of this House have had the temerity to tell women what they should do with their bodies . #% I would like my presence in the Chamber recorded . #% The report at the moment states that the Commission enjoys a discretionary power in relation to its consideration of complaints . #% in writing . - UKIP MEPs abstained because we do not believe that the European Union should be responsible for sending taxpayers ' money to the victims of the Italian earthquake . #% The second time somebody found a bit of plastic , put it into a hole in the wall and that seemed to start the lift up again , but it might have fused the whole system . #% Will you also make progress as regards the in bringing the third pillar -- the intergovernmental part -- into Community competence so that we can be more effective and democratic ? #% If we are to ensure that the public has the right to choose to reject GM we must ensure not only that GM is labelled , but also that non-GM continues to exist . #% I ask him to work with us so that we can turn our mutual desires into a common commitment . #% Two German utilities are divesting themselves of their transmission systems because they have realised there is better value in doing that . #% We must be able to deal properly with the situation of people in these circumstances and not allow a situation to develop where children can be virtually stateless . #% Amendments Nos 1 and 2 bring the text into line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals which had already been agreed last summer : this confirms Parliament 's desire , therefore , to see a degree of coherence in this matter . #% I clearly do not have the unerring experience of fisheries questions that my colleague , Mr Farage , has just demonstrated . #% In fact it should be labelled the Hampton Court ` aMaze ' . #% We spend hours in the European corridors of power talking about unemployment but why do we ignore tourism as an obvious job generator ? #% Mr President , on Tuesday , Mohamed al - ` Owhali was sentenced to life imprisonment in New York for the Nairobi US Embassy bombing , whilst his boss , Osama bin Laden , is given sanctuary by the Taliban as an Islamic hero of Afghanistan . #% This is a real breakthrough for the single market and this House can be proud of its influence in ensuring that the directive is an effective means of extending competition , choice and efficiency . #% That will take a huge slice of the existing framework budget . #% But where to now ? #% The Commission is closely coordinating any action with Norway , as facilitator of the peace process , and with other co-chair countries . #% Clearly Europe is in crisis and we need coordinated measures by the Commission and ECOFIN to try to bring Europe out of that crisis . #% A single blast of the new technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water . #% This is why I can support this motion for a resolution . #% In effect , we will export a large slice of our industry which has just made massive investments to stay compliant with EU rules . #% This leads me to reform . #% The majority of the committee deeply regrets that a weak legal base has meant that the extended family definition we wish to see in Amendment No 20 is so problematic . #% We can not ride roughshod over them as we did in 2001 . #% I echo very much the closing phrases of Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel to us just now : we have to encourage research and development of skills on taking products to market . #% It certainly makes no sense to me that fitness to join the Schengen zone should lie exclusively in the hands of the Member States in any case , irrespective of any arcane split between pre - and post-Schengen accession . #% An alternative proposition is that we start half an hour earlier at 8.30 and then have the voting time at 11 o ' clock . #% Illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment . #% This is an appalling problem , it can be solved and the resolution of it lies in our own hands . #% I am afraid that is par for the course for British participation in the EU . #% Within the narrow confines of this legislation , ensuring standards for adequate enforcement certainly has its own internal logic , but there is more to it than meets the eye . #% All that the President of this Parliament -- who is totally inexperienced -- seems to do is to want to preserve the status quo . #% First , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the broad thrust of her report on cohesion and the information society . #% So much of our discussion about dealing with the unemployment problem takes place at the macro-economic level which seems very remote from the unemployed people we seek to help . #% Madam President , I came to the Chamber this morning with a prepared speech about the situation in the airline industry . #% We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending . #% This Parliament also has a central role in allaying legitimate public fears about the consequences of globalisation . #% Common economic interests and concerns are increasingly global and not bilateral , while regionalisation is increasingly seen as an alternative to the WTO and multilateralism . #% I would vote against Amendment No 12 . #% 
Research is , of course , an area where it makes sense for all our Member States to pool their resources : to have a common programme is much more effective . #% The Socialist group has identified three specific areas which I hope the President-in-Office will take with him to Cardiff . #% I apologise for this interruption . #% He is a desperate man facing a desperate plight and he needs all our support . #% Very simply , I would like to see the next Commission report show that it has not only read Parliament 's report but has actually responded to it . #% This means that none of the existing groups need to fear being dissolved before the election campaign . #% The proposed regulation originated with a petition presented to Environment Commissioner Wallstr√∂m by the Shark Trust , and with a question I tabled in the Environment Committee . #% As work went on in our committee , however , we realised that Nice also had a lot of positive points . #% They are all still there , but they need help where the EU has interfered . #% I wish to draw the attention of the House to an unfortunate incident which has occurred since our last part-session , and that is the case of Mr Panikos Tsiakourmas . #% That point must also be made in this debate . #% My last point is about the position of small shops with regard to implementation . #% Failure will mean that protectionism will fill the vacuum as momentum towards wide-ranging reduction of barriers ceases ; the world economy will slow down and global trade imbalances will continue to rise ; financial markets will become more unstable ; and international economic cooperation will break down further . #% Mr President , I rise to share the concerns of those who have expressed fear about decisions being taken without consulting Parliament on curtailing the mandate of the current European Commission . #% Mr President , may I join in the praise of the Presidents of the Commission and Council for having brokered the deal at Laeken . #% As we are showing on steel tariffs , if the EU punches its weight , the US takes notice . #% In a world where accounting standards generally register low on the Richter scale of political newsworthiness , they have a much higher profile now than is normal . #% Mr President , I want to support Mrs Breyer 's request for exactly the opposite reason . #% She is accused of lying to the European Parliament . #% Will he not accept that this is politically undeliverable unless the Commission takes action ? #% This is a grossly false accusation displaying a regrettable prejudice against the work of the Convention . #% Can we try to find some way of conveying our views to the Russian Government and sorting out this question of freedom of the press and expression which bedevils relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union ? #% They are united in their horror at amendments that would put UK operators out of business , and in their amazement that these proposals are coming from a UK MEP . #% Similarly , its products will gain and not lose by being accurately labelled , so that the public is warned of possible allergens . #% The Council is rarely present in the committees . #% The worst thing that the executive directors of the Bank could find to say against him was that ' a number of mistakes were made ' . #% Paragraph 9 of the draft report talks about the need to preserve the peace clause and special safeguard clause for a provisional period . #% In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have , I am certain that we have installed , or that we will install on the basis of our proposals , a system that will provide the Union , its taxpayers and this House with complete security . #% Then it was surprised that the DPRK did exactly what it said it was going to do and threatened to open its Russian-designed Yongbyong nuclear reactor which like all such reactors is capable of producing weapons grade plutonium . #% I would ask this to be referred to the Rules Committee . #% That is why I am asking colleagues and our President , whose own country , Spain , recognises International Workers ' Memorial Day , to try to have that day formally recognised , so that we think about accidents at work . #% The war in Sri Lanka , President , is one that neither side can win and unless and until there are peace negotiations there will always be applications for asylum seekers in the west , almost all of whom will be Tamils . #% In this regard , there is no way that the EU should accredit Mugabe 's unilaterally appointed envoy as ambassador . #% I went to see a company the other day that makes ceramics in competition with lower cost Portuguese producers . #% Let us not forget that one of the principal causes of death and serious injury on the roads in the European Union is still , sadly , people not wearing a seatbelt . #% I would like to end by quoting from the Treaty on European Union : ` to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom , security and justice , in which the free movement of persons is assured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls , asylum , immigration and the prevention and combating of crime ' . #% This is a very progressive and important step forward . #% The first of these is the election of the Labour Government in the United Kingdom which is introducing a system of proportional representation by regions for European elections . #% Given the dangers that we all face I can not understand why the European governments imagine that there is any advantage in discussing security and defence in a separate room to the Americans . #% It is for the NGOs and civic society to give Europe 's politicians the necessary backbone . #% Mr President , like all the other speakers so far , I must join the chorus and say that I believe this is a reasonable compromise . #% It is timely to introduce that change at this very moment because the Amsterdam Treaty changes the procedure under the Codecision Procedure of the Treaty - the Codecision Procedure which is actually the culmination of Parliament 's legislative powers . #% Unfortunately , however , the report has been hijacked by the protectionist elements in the Committee on Agriculture , and particularly by those who seek to justify massive market-distorting CAP subsidies and who want to make it harder for produce from third world countries to be imported to the EU . #% Sadly , airlines at present do not strictly enforce cabin baggage regulations , which has led to passengers bringing more and more bags into airline cabins . #% I am reminded that at the end of the debate in December on exactly this subject , Commissioner Liikanen accosted me just after he finished speaking and asked whether the Parliament agreed with winding up the JEV Programme , because this was what the Commission very much wanted to do . #% Mr President , this is not quite as dry or as difficult as the title makes it sound . #% We need realism in pursuit of our aims for efficiency . #% Because they do not have systems of environmental inspection which form the essential raft on which the whole edifice of compliance with European environment law is built . #% In recent months , Hamas has made gestures towards moderation and its infamous Israel policy was not included in its election manifesto . #% Smaller programmes which are targeted , can actually work better . #% President Prodi has admitted this inherent risk and the call will come very shortly for a much bigger EU budget and direct EU taxes to set up bail-out funds to compensate affected countries for their loss of rights to devalue their currencies or lower their interest rates . #% There was gross anti-Semitic abuse with , for example , cartoons circulating that could have figured in Julius Streicher 's publications from the 1930s . #% They must all take action against corruption because , as we know ourselves , corruption will undermine the political process . #% The Europeans surveyed , who were a large and representative sample , attribute the growth in poverty and inequality to the increase in long-term unemployment and the loss of solidarity within European societies . #% We have a very diverse tourism industry - from beautiful natural areas to sunshine beaches to our rich industrial and cultural heritage - and Members know how much industrial heritage is close to my heart . #% deputising for the rapporteur . - Mr President , I just wish to say that , while I understand fully the arguments against this proposal , it is unfair to characterise it , as Mr Voggenhuber did , as a conspiracy between the two big groups . #% It exists already : the Court is a constitutional court in many ways . #% The irony tonight is of course that however fast Parliament moves the implementation of programmes on rare diseases and pollution diseases and accidents and injuries will not begin until the evaluation has taken place , which shows the slow pace of development of programmes since the Maastricht Treaty . #% First of all , it has been widely reported in the British press that one of the ways forward now will be core Member States , leaving others behind , so that European integration can happen where it is required , without being held up by others . #% That , of course , links in to the question of commercial services . #% On the main issue of enlargement , it was very important that the summit came to the conclusion that this should be an inclusive process within a single framework , but that at the same time we should recognize that each country should be judged on its merits . #% Unfortunately , in doing so , particularly a couple of weeks in advance , they seem only to have encouraged some of the applicant States to believe that this is just one more stage in the negotiations and quite frankly we have to be clear that it is not . #% I am particularly pleased , too , that Mr Duisenberg has reiterated his promise to publish forecasts and econometric models , and I entirely understand his caveats . #% Firstly , it should be no surprise to us that right-wing governments in Europe are being thrown out by the people for failing to respond to the jobs crisis . #% Is this a matter of public health or public safety , or is it just a trade issue ? #% However , I disagree with the President of the Commission , who wrote in The Wall Street Journal last week that Nice was essential for enlargement . #% 
It should be seen as an invitation for our two institutions to sit down and agree a solution . #% Fifty elected representatives have been gaoled whilst other MPs suffer the indignity of having to report twice daily to local police stations at the behest of the government . #% Now that energy is a shared European competence under the Lisbon Treaty , energy efficiency must also be a shared responsibility . #% I happen to believe that it is safer than other beef because we have got some of the highest hygiene standards in the world now . #% It is now time for the remaining Member States of the Union to follow suit . #% A number of the amendments tabled seek to reverse the decisions firstly of the 1997 Luxembourg European Council confirming that Turkey will be judged on the basis of the same criteria as the other applicant states , and secondly of the Helsinki European Council in 1999 , which recognised Turkey 's status as a fully-fledged candidate country . #% The Brok resolution is a good outline of the issues surrounding the ESDP . #% The real culprits are Austria ' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945 . #% I have also offered - it was only been tabled very late on Thursday of last week - a new amendment which I have discussed with the rapporteur and which specifically looks at a number of exclusions . #% It is , however , deeply ironic that the EU places so much emphasis on democracy elsewhere while ignoring democracy within the EU itself , as can be seen by the reaction to Ireland 's rejection of the Lisbon Treaty . #% British Conservatives oppose this report , which is a recipe for an EU army and a massive extension of Community power into the defence and security arena . #% But will the Presidency accept that it has a responsibility to press for actions on these recommendations and could it perhaps write to me on the specific points that I have just raised ? #% The constitutionalisation process in which the Union is presently involved requires the engagement of mature European political parties . #% In our Parliament , as in theirs , the reason that we have parliamentary immunity is so that we , as representatives of the people , can speak out without fear . #% I would also like to thank the International Trade Committee secretariat for their input and , while I am on my thank-yous , I would like to thank all the DG Trade officials for their useful advice and suggestions . #% At the moment the Prime Minister spoke about half the Chamber got up to walk out . #% Clearly the rapporteur thinks not because he has deleted in Amendment No 15 the possibility of giving micro-companies five years ' grace to comply with the directive and take advantage of the technical changes that bigger companies may pioneer . #% We will be returning to you with two further reports in a few months ' time to confirm the whole process . #% However , contrary to what has been suggested , this proposal does not merely suggest training people to use ladders , nor does it outlaw the use of ladders . #% He set a precedent then , so why were we not permitted this very day to hold up signs saying ` Say no ' ? #% You did not answer the very last question about genetic modification , whether that will intensify the problem of bacteria which is possibly not destroyed by weakened antibiotics . #% But our Group feels there is tremendous potential . #% That is the context of the question . #% This is a crime against humanity of such a scale that it can never be forgiven and we must invoke justice and the rule of law . #% Why is the European Union , as such , not making formal representations ? #% I hope the Commissioner can give us the assurance we need on this action plan . #% Having said that , it is important to remember that while some citizens come here with their particular concerns , there will be many others who perhaps have a different point of view . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I should like to say to the High Representative : thank you so much for your statement . #% Global warming in Africa threatens to wipe out the modest progress that has been made towards the Millennium Development Goals . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the existing directive of 2005 on international protection is to be recast as the Reception Directive for asylum seekers . #% Yes , Cuba violates human rights but not to the extent of Colombia with its death squads or Haiti with the anarchy of criminal gangs and violent politics which have seen more than 1000 deaths . #% I do not think the French were wrong to criticise Britain over some of the practices over BSE in the past . #% This question of balance and balance of interest is clearly at the heart of this report . #% The Council should like to assure honourable Members that the EU will continue to express its concern over specific human rights violations and to impress on the Tunisian authorities the need for full respect for human rights and democratic principles . #% Will they please investigate where the substances came from that caused this incident ? #% We therefore need to consider flanking measures along the lines suggested in the report by , for example , promoting the individualisation of pension rights and urging Member States to guarantee continuity of membership of pension schemes during parental leave or leave to take care of children or other dependants . #% Therefore , the n +2 principle should be rigorously applied across these funds , so that the European taxpayer is not left to foot the bill for projects which run on over their funding deadlines . #% In concrete terms , we want a number of priorities developed at Barcelona , some of which are reflected in the Commission 's synthesis report adopted this week . #% Clearly , in any pan-national single market , measures can not be confined to a single Member State ' s jurisdiction but it does not automatically follow that the correct answer is European-wide harmonisation of penalties , criminal law and procedures . #% Therefore , the Labour Government is not our answer - the Commission is . #% This report now has a series of agreed amendments which we believe will be carried . #% More details will follow shortly and regularly . #% I am sorry to say that the Council 's reaction has been limp-wristed . #% It will always be the case that some internal reflection must remain internal , if the EU is to act effectively in , for example , UN negotiations or in its relations with certain third countries . #% I did not vote to support this report because , while much of the content of the work programme is acceptable , I was concerned about what is not there . #% If we look back at the history of what has happened in Fiji , we see a sweeping electoral victory by the Fijian Labour Party in the May 1999 General Election when they won , with their supporting parties , 58 out of the 71 seats , ousting the incumbent right-wing government . #% Enlargement is one of the great successes of the modern European Union . #% The Commission considers that the realities of expatriate work and life , of significant responsibilities and of rising demand for scarce skills must be reflected in the rewards package for the staff of the institutions . #% It is very easy to criticise other parts of the world ; it is more difficult , and to our credit , that we are prepared to look within the European Union , the European Parliament , the European Commission and the governments working together to make a more democratic institution -- not by any stretch of the imagination a super-state that needs to be feared , as we might read in the papers . #% It is also important to recognise that in light of enlargement these provisions will have to be incorporated into legislation by the candidate countries . #% The third date for the hearing has now been arranged for 11 December 2003 . #% It would be very easy for people in this House to just favour the status quo . #% I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this . #% That sums up what we are trying to achieve on the e-side , the electronic side , of life . #% Briefly , some work has been done on that matter . #% However , when the whole of the EU institutional machinery is focused on the enlargement process , do not forget that there are other European countries with very legitimate cultural and historical links to Europe . #% I am delighted they are going to get a grant but I am rather ashamed that it is so small . #% We are aware that at least 20 of our own Member States have already commented on the draft and been actively involved in this . #% In other words , we will taking into account the Financial Regulation and the budgetary consequences . #% If you look at paragraphs 10 , 11 and 12 of the report , it actually says that we should be looking at the priorities and then deciding what that average overall should be . #% We want to see greater progress made on the issue of international harmonization of standards . #% Mr President , accepting for a moment the rapporteur 's central premise that political parties play a central role in contemporary democracy , the role played by them is on a national stage , even MEPs belong to national parties , and they represent their national electorates . #% Fraud and maladministration can only be tackled if the right structures are put in place and so far this has been slow and inadequate . #% I remain a little concerned that there is no caveat in the legislation to the effect that this instrument should only be used if significant material injury is inflicted upon European Union aircraft carriers . #% We had 26 MEPs , 10 support staff and a press officer . #% I am not sure how much that has to do with the apportionment of the way in which liability arises if pollution does occur . #% 
I hope that these will be coming not just from the Energy Commissioner , who we know is deeply committed to promoting energy saving and renewables . #% The computer-implemented inventions and port services directives were also rejected . #% The critical challenge is how to promote poverty reduction in a newly-liberalised open economy . #% All I would say is that the EU has created a stable and prosperous continent . #% You loathe democracy so much now that you actually call it populism . #% If this Parliament were a proper Parliament , it would actually select Members to sit in the chair on ability and not have the usual big group stitch-ups . #% We need a full assessment of the social , environmental and economic impact of any such bans before we agree to introduce them . #% That is where the bulk of the money is going to come from . #% The Danes set this trend , and I congratulate Mr Magri for keeping it up . #% It is most important that in December 2004 the European Union gives an early date for the opening of negotiations on Turkey 's membership . #% If it is unworkable , then , as the Commission has said , repeal it . #% We have to look at some of the structural barriers that we as a society are also putting in place in terms of active inclusion . #% Other policies championed by the EU are the UN convention on disability , the move beyond the Global Compact towards a binding treaty on corporate accountability and the idea of an economic security council to oversee the Bretton Woods institutions . #% Those of us who have opposed that integration process have often been criticised , and many in this Chamber believe it is the only way forward , but it is not . #% The Commission joins with the Finnish presidency in expressing its sympathy to the Russian authorities . #% We need a programme that works : we have the means to do it and we have the will to do it in this Parliament . #% We must do more to help those developing countries and help the countries that are war-torn and with regimes that we do not like . #% We are concerned by the proposals for constitutionalisation of the Union , by the proposals to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty , by the progressive diminishing of the distinction between the first and second pillars , by the proposal that the Council should adopt broad guidelines of economic , employment and social convergence policies by qualified majority . #% The rights of disabled people are best served in the European context by the inclusion of an anti-discrimination clause in the next Treaty and by specifically addressing the issue of the rights of disabled people in all legislative deliberations and proposals . #% The last thing that we want to see is a depopulated countryside where the green and pleasant landscape which we take for granted will not be looked after properly any longer . #% The other problem is the propensity for the EU to bring in legislative regimes well ahead of the ability of national governments to create the necessary infrastructure to support them . #% As Pascal Lamy has said , the US proposal was five times as ambitious as the EU 's response . #% The implementation of the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination is also crucial . #% I understand that visas have now been granted to those two ministers from Zanu-PF and they are due to arrive in Brussels tomorrow . #% Many French people will have felt that by voting ` no ' they would have stopped the flow of European bureaucracy . #% The European Arrest Warrant offers the perfect expedient . #% It has been a very good team effort . #% We ask that the Commission establish a monitoring mechanism that links the implementation and temporary suspension of trade agreements and autonomous trade measures to beneficiary countries ' compliance with basic democratic standards and respect for human and minority rights , as set out in the European Parliament 's annual report on human rights in the world . #% I want them to stop the abuse of psychiatry . #% Against that backdrop , I have to say I am pleased that in Parliament 's motion for a resolution on the Human Rights Council , which we will vote on tomorrow , we have two very strong paragraphs calling on the High Representative and on Member States to publicly demand the implementation of the report 's recommendations . #% In this context there is one specific question I would like to ask the President of the Commission . #% The sensible equation which seems to be commanding greater support is 55-55 . #% I do not simply refer to the immediate crisis triggered by the failure of the banking system , or the extra pressures now provided by transport emergencies . #% Even if perhaps we are not about to implement it we should not get rid of it . #% We need an EU legislative initiative to facilitate efficient cross-border cooperation and improve upon previous international legal instruments , which are often cumbersome and bureaucratic . #% That will not be overcomplicating things because it ought to be the number one initiative . #% It has taken some time to organise this gettogether . #% Madam President , in commenting on the Sindal report , I very much welcome the plans contained for a switch of 30 to 40 % of trade between Spain and Britain from the roads to short-sea maritime transport . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and other shadows for the hard work they have put into producing these reports . #% When you look at the contracting industry - take electricians , for example - the vast majority are self-employed . #% We hope they will involve fully , where appropriate , international bodies , in particular the WHO , and ensure that the whole world learns lessons from China 's experiences in dealing with this incident . #% One in four bankruptcies are caused by cash-flow problems . #% It was the Socialist leader , Mrs Green , who took the biscuit by voting for a motion of confidence on a motion of censure , which she did indeed get . #% Our politicians in Westminster voted yesterday to deny the British electorate that right . #% Supporters of the EPLA make reference to the USA 's central federal patent court , but this system has led to excessive use of patent , and a considerable volume of litigation and malicious threats of litigation . #% The Coca-Cola Cup is , however , the responsibility of the Football League , not the Premier League . #% To satisfy the insatiable greed of the largely Spanish fishing industry , which nobody dares to oppose for fear of reprisals at the Council of Ministers . #% Mr President , can I start by saying that if somebody was thinking of inventing duty-free tomorrow and they actually came forward with these ideas I am sure they would never be taken up . #% On this occasion we would not be inclined to support it . #% There is one other thing I briefly want to mention . #% Yet however passionate I might have been about my former profession and its independence , I am more passionate about access to justice and legal services in general and how we make those services available to serve the public interest . #% CET , President Bush is due to make an announcement that he is seeking to change the law to make it possible to try Guant√°namo Bay prisoners -- including EU citizens -- by military tribunal . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his report on the protection and conservation of great apes and other species endangered by the illegal trade in bushmeat . #% Your view is absolutely right . #% Contrary to the main thrust of this report , however , I do not believe that this should mean replacing the strong links between the United States and individual member states ( Britain in particular ) with an ` EU-US partnership ' . #% The second reason is that we have to , in this increasingly homogenised era of global audio-visual content , get into the area of freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of diversity . #% I welcome the decision of the Council to increase the safeguard clauses from two years to three years , although I am concerned by the wording which says that these could apply from day one of accession . #% I hope also that people on both sides of this House would recognise the importance of their applying to everybody in real social inclusion . #% It is always a sensitive time to raise human rights and Kurdish rights in Turkey , but if we do not , we let down Turkey itself and its prospects of getting into the EU . #% Patience is needed , as is the continuing security provided by the coalition forces , to give the Iraqi people the time and space they need to unravel the evil web Saddam wove so skilfully around them . #% But I believe this time we have a report which , though it might not be what all of us would have wished in every respect , nevertheless commands very wide support . #% I been appalled to come across examples where the Commission has blatantly rejected the Ombudsman 's findings . #% But it is , as you know , nine years , plus two years , plus one year . #% So for God 's sake , Postcomm , get off the battlements and see sense ! #% Now , if the 12 euro countries wish to undertake a propaganda campaign , that is no business of mine . #% Increasing membership and consensus-based decision-making , whilst seemingly more democratic , still does not compensate for the influence of industrialised countries compared with that of their developing counterparts . #% 
It is estimated that 100 000 companies are not receiving a statutory audit in Italy , which puts in danger the reliance which can be placed on the accounts of these particular companies . #% The UK government is strongly opposed to the rapporteur 's proposed amendments which , it maintains , would damage industry and agriculture for no benefit . #% Indeed , access at its best is the great equaliser , the great force for democracy . #% It was resolved at political level by the Member States , on the clear understanding that the work of these organisations on combating discrimination is vital in pushing forward the EU agenda . #% In Srpska , which has been ethnically cleansed , there was politics of a different sort . #% Otherwise money will continue to be wasted or stagnate whilst Europe 's transport networks suffer . #% It needs to be an integral part of the policy and regulation process . #% They must be screened , and all those who are not genuine refugees must be detained . #% On whose authority are you people the government of Europe ? #% At the very least , I call for a three-yearly review in future to see how this TRIPS agreement works out in practice . #% The majority of Members have never seen the inside of the IPE IV building , though I am told that lots of people who are not Members have been taken around . #% Would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament 's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ? #% I also want to pay tribute to Mrs Cederschi√∂ld for her wise leadership that has enabled us to arrive at a very satisfactory outcome to this conciliation . #% The proposed salary is not the same as a UK MPs ' salary , but the overall package is not dissimilar when all aspects are taken in the round . #% If there is delay , if agreement is not reached on the regulation , then new programmes will be affected too . #% Mr President , not specifically on the Minutes but on the Brussels Notebook which we have just found in our pigeonholes . #% I am sure that that constructive attitude will continue to characterise our discussions on reform , since as honourable Members know , I regard the understanding and support of this House for all our reform proposals to be absolutely critical . #% Whilst these matters are just peanuts , they seem to take up a lot of time in the committees , as every member of the Committee on Budgets knows . #% Certain EU governments are targeting individuals through stop-and-search procedures based entirely upon racial profiling . #% As ever , the worst results of such horrors are suffered by the innocent and the effects will blight their lives for many years to come . #% Finally , concerning the amendments tabled , which I have only just seen today , I welcome Amendments Nos 22 and 25 : Amendment No 22 as a second choice if Amendment No 5 falls and Amendment No 25 as a recital as it hits the tone of my report very well . #% In particular , this presidency must take forward the report by Wim Kok . #% Whilst greater coordination is required at European level over our airspace ( i.e. Eurocontrol ) , service provision should remain at national level - the Commission has never suggested a single agency and Eurocontrol already exists to coordinate . #% I also voted against eight amendments , which , when taken in combination , actually increased funds to fruit and vegetable sectors , which is against the UK Labour Party 's view that support spending should be reduced and contradicts CAP reform . #% The Constitution was intended to address these shortcomings with sets of reforms that , although not very radical , would be useful . #% When we judge him in December we hope that he will not have failed us . #% We do not know how this will be achieved ; we do not know how EFSA will run it . #% At the same time there has to be proper control and management of international funds . #% His report rather smacks of complacency . #% Not just in Palestine , but elsewhere in the Arab world -- including in Egypt , where the Muslim Brotherhood did so well in November and December ; in the Moroccan parliamentary elections to come -- we are about to see the emergence of fundamentalist Islamist politics across the Arab world , an Arab world of 250 million people . #% However , there have been stumbles along the way to the intended creation of a real competitive market for digital broadcasting and towards a measured advanced analogue switch-off . #% President Bush rightly talks about Arab freedom . #% I understand there is no intention to hold referendums in Romania and Bulgaria . #% I was then promised a written answer by last Thursday , but that did not happen either and I still have not received an answer . #% in writing . - Russia remains an important strategic partner for the EU . #% This could all be replaced by other substances which could be grown rather than harvested from the sea . #% Thirdly on mine-clearance , we need a structured and coordinated approach , not just within the institutions of the European Union but throughout the international community so that what is done is done properly and wisely . #% However , as President Prodi himself said , there is still some room for improvement . #% The Treaties have always conferred certain rights directly on citizens and therefore on the way that citizens are governed within Member States . #% We can not be complacent about Latin America and take the huge achievement of spreading democracy there for granted . #% The legislation was ill-conceived and did not take into consideration the difficulties experienced by small businessmen and by many professions . #% That is why my Group has decided to support the spirit of the resolution , despite some of the wording and difficulties concerning the possible financial contribution from the Union , which is why we have asked for a separate vote on that issue . #% In terms of timing and linking these proposals together , I am really pleased that we now have this major reform , because it will be an indispensable building block of our overall approach . #% This can not make sense and I am sure is not something that you are familiar with in your own administration . #% As the Commissioner indicated , it has been a long and sometimes bumpy road towards the final agreement on this very complex text . #% You have to take specific action to address those at the bottom . #% The problem we have is , first of all , that we can not know there will be an increase and even if we could predict that , we can not know what the increase will be . #% The EU has also concluded unfair and immoral fishing agreements with many third world countries in Africa , which allow European factory farming boats , not unlike the ones that pose a threat to dolphins , to come down and plunder African seas of all their fish . #% However , I hope that the Eastern Partnership will not lead to new dividing lines being drawn between those countries in the Partnership and those countries further east and outside of it . #% We will benefit from the experience of Socrates I and the new coherent and comprehensive approach that we will see in Socrates II . #% The European Parliament should definitely send observers to watch Kyrgyzstan 's transition to democracy . #% Whilst the legal justification for action in the area of public health is clear , it seems to me that there is still a lack of clarity with regard to the legal basis for action by the Commission in some other areas . #% We should ask ourselves if our future aid should be linked to better attitudes and citizens ' rights . #% The world has watched in amazement , both at the immense flow of gas and oil from the ruptured pipe following the explosion and disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and at the seeming inability of both the industry and the US authorities to stem the flow ; we must hope that recent developments will prove successful . #% The whole House , including this side of the House , should support such an agenda if , indeed , it happens . #% What is now upon the table seems the best possible deal that the Turkish Cypriots can ever expect . #% It will not lead to increased spending by the Union ; it will provide a more transparent procedure for the sort of spending that already takes place via the political groups . #% All this coincides with the convenient issuing of a European Arrest Warrant against him . #% It is no such thing . #% Mr President , it may seem odd that with my constituency in Hampshire , I should want to intervene in a debate about Scottish salmon . #% Port expansion at Bathside Bay , so recently approved at Harwich , and the positive decision we very much hope for this week for the Felixstowe South expansion , are both in jeopardy . #% We in the EU must also play our part . #% Lastly , the timescale . #% I take the point that the honourable Member made about the single-sex nature of the selection board . #% The second amendment , which is important , is the amendment on incitement to racial discrimination which is as important as the act of racism itself , and I hope the Commission will take it on board . #% The prescription is one that we are a long way away from being in a position to realize , and it is for that reason I will not be supporting those parts of the report that refer either to ` European public prosecutor ' or ` European judicial authority ' . #% 
As a member of the Committee on Petitions , may I say that it is a really good example of a cross-party , consensual approach to problem-solving . #% British Conservative MEPs urge the parliamentary authorities to ensure that future reports of this kind are under the stewardship of someone who will take a less personal and more objective approach . #% Mr President , high standards of human rights are part of the of the EU , both internally and internationally , in its foreign and development policies . #% Giving issuers the maximum facility and flexibility in choosing a jurisdiction is one of the best ways to facilitate genuine cross-border trade and genuine integration of our capital markets . #% Mr President , right at the outset I would like to say to Mr Helmer and others that people on this side of the House are not in the business of shackling or hampering the decision-making capabilities of businesses . #% Rightly , others have paid tribute to Mr Imbeni , my predecessor as Vice-President representing Parliament on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly . #% I am assured that bulk imports in the UK are carefully protected by making sure that the right label goes on the right wine . #% Congestion , pollution , gridlock , global warming , floods , freak weather . #% Mr President , I welcome this resolution which aims to promote core labour standards . #% Many consumers will tell you that it is impossible to tell where the poultry meat comes from in the composite foods we buy throughout the European Union . #% So this is also an attempt to smuggle in a competence by the back door . #% Conservatives believe that this must be tackled as a matter of urgency by the Commission . #% I do not think it is my place as an MEP to tell those involved in the performing arts how they should regulate their own affairs . #% There has been improvement since the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre report on this subject last year . #% I believe that good agencies have nothing to fear from this directive . #% This is all it should be : no Parliament , no Commission , no directives . #% Thirdly , paragraph 27 , on a different tack , urges the Commission to encourage enhancing production of oil in Europe through improved techniques of extraction . #% There can be no dispute that this type of waste is a problem . #% Indeed , I sometimes think the only qualification you need to be a rapporteur in this area is to be a fast reader . #% As we rightly strive to develop common European policies for asylum and , in parallel , common policies for Europe for legal immigration , this tragedy and other similar ones have drawn yet further attention to the need for the EU to be constantly aware of the less prosperous states around it and to do ever more to support those countries , of which Albania is just one example . #% I support the call to reject this proposal , thus making the review unnecessary . #% On 5 February , I received a reply from the Turkish Ambassador informing me that the Turkish Ministry of Justice was willing to allow a delegation of MEPs to visit F-type prisons in order to see some of the problems and the steps being taken to overcome them . #% You could have democratised the EU with this Treaty . #% Madam President , I would like to pay tribute to Mrs Kla√ü for her work on this excellent report . #% We need a strong contingency plan to keep the disease out of the EU and if we are unfortunate enough for the disease to enter Europe we will need the right procedures in place to stamp it out quickly . #% I believe the decision by the Court was more about propping up the fast-track trial procedure than about justice . #% I call on colleagues to reject the amendments and support the Commission proposal . #% There were concerns about whether market forces would win out over services of general interest ; and that people who were concerned about patients ' rights to choose , and to travel , were being pitted against those who were asking which patients would actually exercise that choice . #% At the same time , however , for most items of expenditure they represent an increase on current levels of EU spending . #% No-one is more guilty of passing bad laws or failing to monitor good ones than Member State governments . #% To my mind , it is the fact that some 40 % of the EU budget is spent on the common agricultural policy and it is also the fact that the United Kingdom , year on year for twenty years , has been paying double the amount in net terms into the EU budget , even with her abatement , in comparison with a country such as France that has a similar-sized economy . #% Mr President , the British Labour MEPs fully support the polluter pays principle and , with this in mind , believe that the cost of motoring in general should better reflect the real costs to society and , in particular , the environment . #% I went to northern Ghana to meet tomato and rice farmers . #% As we know from our debate last month on the Communist regime 's vandalism of the ancient city of Kashgar , China vigorously tries to suppress cultural expression that does not conform to what its Communist rulers deem appropriate . #% This is to be the lower House , as the President of the Republic told us this morning and if we are to carry public opinion with us in security and defence matters we need a proper position . #% I have no idea precisely what information is being collected , who authorized its collection or how it is subsequently being stored . #% Either they should be taken into care or the begging is unjustified because they should be receiving social benefits from the state . #% I also accept what she has said on the amendments . #% Undoubtedly , the promised long-term approach , setting multi-annual catch targets , will be a major improvement and help to solve the problem of discards . #% Those are the Commission 's own words . #% This prejudice must be suppressed by the Feira Council if the project is to succeed . #% Europeans should surely be able to legislate as they wish to protect the population of Europe , and give them the highest standards possible of noise protection . #% Members have in front of them a report not just from the Committee on Budgets , but one that has attempted to take on board the opinions of the other committees . #% They gained entry as a news team to the committee meeting when her report was adopted , and used the material to make a video that caricatures the views of the Committee on the Environment and its rapporteur . #% The report welcomes ` an enhanced European defence capability ' and explicitly endorses the European Security and Defence Policy , to which Conservative opposition has been constant . #% This would enable the Council to go through its procedures very swiftly and make a lot of European industries happy . #% I do not want to see this limited to a few demonstration projects . #% How cheap then is European citizenship , which is forced on people , is unwanted and can not be refused or renounced . #% Without a successful European economy we can not meet the challenges ahead , particularly of enlargement . #% Technology is available to ensure that windows made of old lead-containing PVC are overlaid with new PVC so people do not come into contact with it . #% Ironically , the timing has been more of a problem this time around with Parliament and that is partly because the Industry Committee decided that it wanted to produce an opinion and wrote to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee and asked if the vote in committee could be deferred . #% It is obvious that the current economic system is not delivering an adequate standard of living for many people within the EU , and before we push applicant countries in the same direction we have to know what we can do that is more effective in meeting people 's needs . #% I thank the Commissioner for his reply but have to say , nonetheless , that I find it a little disappointing . #% If the Conservative Party had ever thought to patent lies , deceit and hypocrisy , they would have made a fortune in royalties and would perhaps be in a position to pay off the national debt ! #% This is a budget line which does genuinely good work for the people of Europe and brings real and genuine benefits and it must be protected . #% In justice and home affairs there is not the same sense of zeal from ministers about promoting freedom as about promoting security . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Piebalgs for his role in convening the Gas Coordination Group and thereby making a major contribution towards resolving the dispute between Naftagas and Gazprom earlier this month . #% As Mr Bowis himself pointed out , we have only just begun to scratch the surface in terms of what we would call promoting mental wellbeing . #% We do not enable them to cope ; we must . #% However , we should all recognise that where governments through no fault of their own are unable to provide basic services such as health , education and water to the poorest citizens , then entrepreneurs must have a role to fill in the gaps in service provision . #% He has done a good job and clearly worked very hard on this . #% Overall the EPLP feels that this report did not enhance the capabilities of EU States to deal effectively yet humanely with the returning of third country nationals residing illegally in the EU but has instead added extra burdens to an already complicated and highly emotionally charged issue . #% In fact , it will probably become hardly worth fishermen putting to sea in many parts of the European Union 's waters . #% Is the Council aware that only in the last few days there has been a further crackdown on the activities of human rights organisations in Aceh . #% Secondly , we consider that violations of Community law appear to be at issue , in particular environmental law and public procurement rules . #% We recognise the importance of good company practice where compliance is genuinely sought all the way down the line , and we also recognise the valuable work of networks , trade unions and reputable companies in helping to prevent trafficking and deal with the victims . #% 
I am glad to say that yesterday the Commission gave a cool response to the British proposals to set up refugee detention centres in places like the Balkans because the difficulties of that would be considerable . #% Despite the progress at Doha , as far as patent rules are concerned , the story is far from over . #% I will go straight into the core of what my questions are . #% The rapporteur can be truly proud of his work and he is to be congratulated on it . #% It is because there are breaches of human rights in Venezuela that we have this motion for a resolution . #% According to the Commission 's own report , those involved in the formulation , implementation , monitoring and evaluation of policies , particularly the Commission itself , will be the main beneficiaries of this proposal . #% Perhaps this would be a subject for Stockholm : stimulating heads of state to start debates . #% Such a coherent policy should promote the interests of the Chinese people , but not the interests of the Chinese Communist Party . #% But the benefits of the European Union and of the single market should mean that we can still create jobs satisfactorily despite what is happening outside the European Union borders . #% It is not a matter of amending the text formally in the plenary , but when the toilettage of the text is done I would like them to look notably at Article 5 ( 2 ) , where the English version specifies that Parliament verifies that a party meets the necessary conditions by a majority of its Members . #% There is a crisis in the fishing industry of Europe . #% Concerning the own-resources side of the budget , would he agree with me that it is an extremely serious picture that is painted ? #% Not large hospitals , for which there will not be enough staff or resources , but more mass immunisation , more primary health clinics , more mobile health clinics . #% The possible opt-outs that are on offer are not a realistic or effective way of dealing with these concerns , since developing countries still do not have the capacity now to affect the negotiations of an agreement which they may be later under pressure to sign . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , I do not know where the Commissioner has been , but we adopted a position this morning . #% In addition , we believe that asylum policy must remain the competence of national governments and do not believe in a pan-European approach as stated in recital L. #% EU development policy should be guided by all UN international development targets and not just poverty . #% This is a welcome reallocation of resources - provided , of course , that the reallocated money is well spent ! #% Furthermore , I believe that it prejudices a proper and legitimate aspect of intra-European trade , threatening to reduce the movement of literature across Europe to the level of pornography sent through the post , so I am reliably informed , in unmarked brown manilla envelopes , and in the free world reducing the legitimate trade in books to the level of smuggling in and out of eastern Europe of so-called subversive literature . #% In paragraph 1.18 there is a quotation from the transit report where we called for the Community customs services to work together as if they were one . #% This is , frankly , nonsense . #% I support , therefore , Commission statements and the Commissioner 's action on this matter . #% Mr President , against my advice , Parliament adopted the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , to my report on comitology . #% Finally , I welcome the amendment tabled by the PSE Group , which serves as a balanced summary of the key issues at stake . #% Finally , Mr President , whatever the justification for widening the Eurodac fingerprinting system to some categories of illegal immigrants , I am personally not convinced that this proposal is legally watertight . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . - Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his patience above all else . #% Crime is a major concern for our citizens ; we must ensure it stays our number one priority in Europe . #% We have to make sure that there is a link between the work of national parliaments and the European Parliament in ensuring that we have the democratic accountability of our Central Bank . #% Secondly , the directive proposes to compile a top ten list of vehicles according to class . #% The danger is that all the good work and good intentions that colleagues have spoken about here will come to nothing if presidency after presidency does not build on what has happened already . #% Having said that , any solutions to these problems have to be accepted by the people of Europe , both our own voters and the voters in the applicant countries . #% Enlargement will bind these countries to the West , encourage economic prosperity and make a much more coordinated fight against crime and illegal immigration possible when organisations such as Europol have a formal mandate . #% Presumably , if a Member disagrees with a majority decision of his colleagues or if he is too busy elsewhere to take part in a decision of the committee with which he disagrees . #% In the United Kingdom , we already have a very Euro-sceptic electorate . #% However , this report seems to set the barrier of membership of Turkey at a higher level than other states . #% Whether the case is before the Court or not , given that we are co-legislator it would be staggering if the European Parliament did not have an opinion on whether a Member State is compliant . #% Our UK solution is to mechanically stamp eggs with the code numbers that represent their method of production at the laying farm itself . #% There have been many wonderful contributions from this Chamber . #% That is what this proposal is all about . #% I would like to say a few words about the matters that the rapporteur has raised . #% However , I can not and will not persuade them that their hard-earned tax money should assist the purchase of another Mercedes for a cereal baron . #% The point was made very strongly there by representatives of the radio industry that digital radio is one sector of media communication that is not developing as quickly and as effectively as it might do , and the feeling was that political backing was lacking . #% I wish to put on public record the high esteem in which I hold him as co-rapporteur on the Committee on Budgets for the satellite agencies . #% 11 September has now given us a heightened sensitivity to potential threats . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for a thorough piece of work , a reanalysis of a proposal that Mrs Hedkvist Petersen handled so capably some months ago and in which I was also involved . #% When you first titillated us with the prospect of presenting this White Paper over a year ago , we were all very excited at the idea of having some great constitutional blueprint . #% I shall use my common sense and recommend that we vote against Mr Lannoye 's amendment . #% On Mozambique , for instance , it is very significant that the IMF , the World Bank and the Paris Club only postponed payments from Mozambique and then actually lent more money . #% Because that is the part of the hearing spectrum industrial hearing loss often destroys . #% It is also likely to do incomparable damage to the economies of many European former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean , which were major beneficiaries of the old regime . #% I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Herbert B√∂sch in his report on the Ombudsman , my colleague on the later report , Felipe Camis√≥n on the work of the Petitions Committee and Mrs Almeida Garrett on her work on the Statute of the Ombudsman . #% In September Mr Sharipov got out by letter allegations of his ill-treatment and of how he was threatened in prison by police and prison officers . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate the UK presidency on the clear commitments they have made to these trade and development talks . #% And of course , we have familiar tales of child labour . #% The phrase that comes to mind is one often seen on a schoolboy 's report : ` could do better ' . #% Mr President , we object on principle to the accelerating growth of European Union military structures outside the NATO Alliance , with all their attendant costs and politically divisive intent . #% And so we have this draft directive to address the problem . #% In the face of that , the measures in this report can be seen to be justifiable and sensible , although some are perhaps more appropriate for action at Member State level . #% Secondly , in relation to Amendment 8 - which has been mentioned by more than one Member - it worries me more for the process by which it was agreed than for the substance that it contains . #% They want a consistent code across each of the institutions . #% I can not see how consumers will benefit . #% The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House , holding a senior position within his delegation , continues to offer strategic advice to private clients , but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are . #% Nor did I cast any aspersions about why Mrs Garaud has not been able to go up to now . #% As other people have said , we need to bring pressure to bear to try and bring the parties together to endeavour to reach a peaceful solution . #% The citizens of the European Union do not have enough information . #% I say to Mr Lamy , who is the really important man here today , that we have a situation where England is the dustbin of Europe . #% 
Ayman Nour has hundreds , nay , thousands of supporters . #% I am the last to imagine that terrorism will be defeated merely by more intensive security measures . #% Madam President , housing cooperatives , women 's employment projects , new media and cultural industries , environmental regeneration projects are known to many of us in our local area . #% I am concerned that the delay undermines Galileo 's business plan in other respects as well . #% If taxation of energy is to be used for pursuing environmental aids , then the policy has to be transparent and consistent so as to carry public opinion with us . #% We want a stronger network of computer scientists and specialists working in universities and technology institutes who are linked together by a global research network . #% What it should do is embrace free trade and lower the trade barriers and tariffs -- in fact remove trade barriers and tariffs that are holding back the economic development of these countries . #% It is somewhat ironic that it says in the first paragraph of their document : `` The Council welcomes the spirit of cooperation that governed work on preparation and emphasises the importance of continuing the good collaboration between the two arms of the budgetary authority and the Commission . '' #% When we look at the situation in Europe at the moment it is simply not satisfactory . #% Jacques Santer was absolutely right when he said Europe must do less but do it better . #% The honourable Member has provided the words in this report ; now it is time for the Commission to act . #% Is this what we expect from the modern Labour Party , which rolls over to be tickled on the issues vital to the UK and all because it wants to suck up to the EU and look presidential ? #% I just want to endorse in the strongest terms what has been said here today by Mr Muscat . #% I would like to thank all the colleagues who have participated in this debate . #% Whenever we mention tourism to the Council , or indeed to the Member States , it seems to be that they collectively all go on holiday . #% I urge the Commission to rethink that and look at the old IACS forms . #% Mr President , I begin by congratulating not only the rapporteur but the Commission itself . #% It then goes on to talk about continuing violation of human rights in Ethiopia . #% He did not have any answers to some of the real economic problems that we are seeing in the eurozone . #% We call upon the Commission to act . #% The problem is not the absence of standards but the absence of practical respect , and many Member States find themselves before the Strasbourg Court for this reason . #% A lot depends on whether the President-in-Office can persuade his colleagues in the Council , and I am sure that he will do that . #% The case of El Salvador has already been raised . #% The EU committee did more to raise the profile of the EU and put a proactive and positive impression forward of what Brussels was attempting to do , than anything else I have witnessed while I have been a Member of this Parliament . #% Latvia has made real progress in its citizenship laws , with the economy , in administration and in preparing for the implementation of the acquis . #% I note your remarks with interest , Commissioner , and am delighted to hear that the Commission takes this issue seriously , but your role as I see it seems to be confined to reminding Member States , requesting strong action and then requesting to be informed . #% Asylum and immigration , and policies on tackling crime and terrorism , are of crucial concern to cities . #% This statement and others in the report point to increasing communitarisation , which we do not believe is necessary or desirable as it risks undermining national and local counter-violence strategies . #% It follows that international money to fund debt relief must be in addition to , and not instead of , aid . #% This is not the first report that Mr Alyssandrakis has drawn up on the subject of space and , I suspect , not the last . #% Its reputation and image abroad has been damaged by the violence , massacres and abuses of human rights there , but that is nothing compared with the pain and suffering of its people at home . #% To put it at its crudest , how will we explain the situation to the people of Europe if , after 2002 , they still hear noisy old planes from third countries , fitted with the hushkits we judge inadequate , clattering round our skies ? #% He said at the beginning of his contribution that it would be our last opportunity to hear him . #% So , for my political group , the balance of this proposal is no longer clear either on inspections or remuneration , and other areas have been watered down . #% author . - Madam President , I think - I hope - that most of us in this House would agree that our preference is for multilateral negotiations and a successful outcome for the Doha Development Round at the WTO . #% For the rest of my time , I want to turn to Mr Viola 's report which , again , is excellent . #% Had I been here , I would have made a correction . #% Questions of diet and life style and environment and medical science itself will demand significant European responses , which is why it is important that we make coherent and consistent progress and is why the scrutiny provided by reports such as that by Mrs Flemming on the integration of health policies across the range of EU competence is so important and so revealing . #% Mr President , let me begin by commenting on EU action on justice and home affairs . #% I shall leave it there , as I have covered the agricultural scene totally . #% The memory of the 6 million Jewish martyrs , of their lives and emotions , of their culture and of their potential , needs to be preserved . #% The lives of more of our citizens are blighted by the lack of access to civil justice or cross-border redress mechanisms than , fortunately , are directly touched by terrorism . #% I want to speak briefly about three points : firstly , the liberalization agenda , which has set the need for universal service ; secondly , universal service itself ; and , thirdly , to say a bit more about the definition and how that definition should develop . #% This question will be examined at the NATO summit on enlargement later this week in Prague . #% I thank my own group staff for their hard work and I pay tribute to the NGOs that have contributed valuable ideas . #% I have several important points to make on my report concerning the Marco Polo Programme . #% Mr President , the Commissioner has heard many speeches today , as well as my remarks at the beginning of the debate this morning . #% Pilot schemes , as you say , are being carried out and I was interested not so much in assessments but in whether proper provision within the budgets for preparatory action will be included . #% In 2001 Lukashenko won 75 % support , although the OSCE declared that the election had failed to comply with its minimum standards . #% When I tabled this question two months ago I did not know that , coincidentally , there would be a debate this afternoon on immigration and asylum . #% Mr President , I also would like to thank the Commissioner for her extensive description of the Council meeting , which is most important . #% However , 25 % of the vote clearly does not give Kadima such a mandate and , even if it could garner additional support in the Knesset , a unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank and the unilateral setting of borders not in accordance with the 1967 borders can not be a solution . #% I ask the Commissioner to put some flesh on those two issues for us . #% I strongly support Mr Solana 's reiteration this morning that the fight against terrorism must take place within international law . #% At their trial on 26 April 2002 many of them were sentenced to terms of imprisonment , but at their appeal on 6 November 2002 those present were acquitted of all charges . #% So you could see a huge change in attitudes in the space of two decades . #% It is essential that we have that reform , both for the sake of the current Union , and certainly to facilitate accessions . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply to the questions so far . #% Is he aware of the extent of the problem and does he accept , as this report states , that citizens have the right to equivalent healthcare in every Member State and that this needs reinforcing ? #% If that was the case , we would not have as many cases as there are , certainly in my country , of illegal and covert irradiation . #% I understand that there will be a roll-call vote on Amendment No 11 . #% Many of us here do not find them convincing . #% I , myself , will be serving quaint British cherry Bakewell tarts to users at the Suffolk Learning and Resource Centre in Bungay and will then go on to sell handshakes at 10p each to schoolchildren at the Highwood Infant School in King 's Lynn , Norfolk . #% Mr President , we have had considerable difficulties over the last couple of years with these reports on human rights because of differences of view as to what constitutes human rights and other similar problems . #% I believe this directive marks the start of a new era in which across Europe we will all become much wiser about the way we use energy and I hope the House will support the compromise wholeheartedly . #% But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation , stifling individual initiative and enterprise . #% 
Over-regulation creates artificial jobs , which are not economically justified . #% In these circumstances , do you agree that it is all the more urgent to proceed rapidly ? #% To ensure that we have healthy citizens we have to ensure that drugs are as inexpensive as possible . #% These merely serve to sustain generalised , stereotypical , negative images of Turkey and the Turkish peoples . #% The social dimension of globalisation is highly important , because globalisation brings with it change and all change is a challenge . #% I think that if we do not resolve this problem it will not just be one Prime Minister from one state demanding her money back , but all citizens demanding all their money back . #% It should also tackle the important issue of the abolition of the death penalty , and again , we call on the EU to sponsor a resolution inviting all states to introduce a moratorium on executions with a view to the total abolition of the death penalty , and we reiterate our request to the US , China , Saudi Arabia , Congo , Iran and other states to immediately end all executions . #% And , in the meantime , consumers across the European Union will have to pay , as they have always done , and as they will continue to do unless we tackle the issue of the cartel . #% However , as we know , the blasphemy law in Pakistan puts the lives of Pakistani citizens at risk : Muslim , Christian and others alike , as many speakers have said this afternoon . #% Firstly , it is time for bold thinking . #% I doubt they are listening right now , but perhaps we can send them a copy of the Minutes of this stimulating discussion later on . #% We simply go through the motions in what is a pale shadow of a parliament . #% Last week a Belgian Government Commission presented a report to its Parliament on the question of religious sects and various cults . #% In fact , the only employment she can get is with French private schools as an animatrice , which is a very low grade of occupation . #% Whether that is achieved by cutting the number of seats for the three current states - which may be difficult - or by raising the number for Hungary and the Czech Republic , the issue must be addressed in the Accession Treaty . #% Opening up the seat as a discussion point would unnecessarily waste time and could prolong the establishment phase of the joint undertaking . #% Let me begin with some items in my report . #% Let us be quite clear that many known particles are part of existing chemical stock and should therefore be treated under that category . #% In the United Kingdom we have highly professional and experienced security services , but their efforts are undermined by a failure on the part of government to take the most basic steps . #% in writing . - I supported amendments put forward to change the common fisheries policy in a way which would have ended some of the distortions that exist already . #% Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan and , to a lesser extent , Georgia and Armenia are heavily influenced by the presence of the Caspian Sea and , particularly , the exploitation and transportation of oil . #% I hope the Council takes cognisance of that fact . #% The rule of law is extremely uneven in Pakistan . #% Subsequently , Council Regulation 3922/91 was established in which the technical requirements , known as Joint Aviation Requirements , formulated by the JAA , were given the force of law within the Community . #% All sides in this civil conflict -- the insurgent Communist Party of Nepal , Marxists and the Nepalese Royalist Army -- are committing human rights abuses on a massive scale . #% Secondly , can he confirm that applicant countries have to apply to join the EEA - i.e. that this is compulsory , that they are required to apply . #% One thing I would highlight from the position of the Environment Committee is the need for the European Union to sort itself out when it comes to addressing the issue of genetically modified production in the countries of the third world . #% We have tried to solve that by putting more regulations on existing regulations , with little additional affect . #% When the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs debated this Commission proposal on which I was a rapporteur , we found that none of us in the Committee were aware at all ; and I wonder if the public listening to Question Time in the gallery are aware either . #% I want to pinpoint three issues : disability rights ; the need to be able to report parliamentary and judicial proceedings ; and the issue of fair compensation . #% How can one speak of a social model that consigns so many to the misery of joblessness ? #% Mr President , I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur . #% Women 's resistance to the regime still has to work underground . #% This more modest change would require the chairmen and rapporteurs of the committees concerned to meet and jointly identify areas of the text falling within their executive or joint competences . #% This continuum is well represented by the various reports that we are discussing today . #% Instead , we see the EU octopus bureaucracy once again using private misfortune to plunder the sovereignty of Member States . #% We abhor the Chinese Government 's disgraceful treatment of this distinguished artist . #% If some of the people who now oppose the European arrest warrant - in particular those on the right , not least in my own country - also cry `` shock ! horror ! '' at what they might claim is harmonisation of criminal justice systems , they will be guilty of great hypocrisy . #% The politicians in charge became very greedy ; they wanted money for themselves and they wanted power . #% This would encourage the forces of progress and reform within Turkey and increase the leverage of the European Union upon Turkey ' s future development . #% The guilty are not only free but continue to exercise influence in the region and nobody , but nobody is being deterred . #% But for that to happen , Europe has got to stop spending so much time developing strong rhetoric and a little bit more time acting in the foreign affairs field . #% In the United Kingdom , we still only have two dogs - in fact they are still in training - to check imports , compared with the 3 000 people in the United States to cover illegal imports . #% I am very disappointed indeed that Mr Persson did not take the opportunity this morning to criticise President Putin for the way in which he is repressing the media in Russia , the way in which democracy is being rolled back . #% I would warn colleagues about some of the remarks that have been made about security of supply . #% So I am urging caution and would appreciate an answer to that particular question . #% You used a great phrase -- and I applaud you for it -- about putting out the red carpet for small enterprises . #% Mr President , I wish to make three points . #% This is the cruelty-free future we should all plan for and I hope we will all vote for tomorrow . #% They are angry -- and rightly so -- about unfair trade rules that work against those living in poverty and they are passionate about the need for change . #% If we have that right then we will be much more willing to delegate more measures , knowing that we have that safeguard in place . #% Does he consider it helpful as part of this examination that there is consultation with the industry , with the trade unions and indeed the regions to make sure that the concerns of local people are addressed ? #% It is for all our remote and island communities , no matter where in the European Union they are situated , and not just for the people of Scotland , that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide . #% I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects , not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo ? #% We have done well but we could still do a lot better . #% I accept that in the interim it may be delivered by air . #% I mentioned in my speech that the EU must be accountable . #% I also want to thank our colleagues in the ALDE and UEN Groups who helped us achieve a very important result in the committee back in November . #% I seek your guidance again . #% The coverage of the very considerable costs of waste disposal , for instance , should not simply be lifted from the accounting books of companies producing nuclear energy . #% I did not realise its members felt they had the right to be spokesmen for the LDC and ACP countries , which have a slightly different view from what is proposed in their amendments . #% Do we really think that the Union is going to be stable once Turkey , and perhaps other countries , which will then no doubt be welcomed under the same criteria , have joined , and that the Union can then be effectively managed ? #% These include the rate of statutory interest to be charged when a late payment occurs ; the length of the trigger period for interest if no contract has actually stipulated a payment period ; retention of title in the course of late payment ; the role of the public sector and the treatment of public procurement ; and compensation claims arising from late payment . #% They know how to apply political pressure , much of it far from evidence-based , on Parliament . #% Secondly , we should follow the ideas of the Houston Declaration of the US Congress and the European Parliament and involve the parliamentary community more in the summit process . #% Despite his previous status Mr Anwar had a black eye and other evidence of the physical abuse to which he had been subjected when he appeared in court . #% 
One fix I would like is to minimise court fees , rather than force litigants to bear all the costs of judges ' salaries and the establishment costs of the appeal court . #% Are the suggestions for reorganising the whole system coming from OLAF , because OLAF is a Commission service , or are we going to be able to have OLAF 's report so that we as a Parliament can assess the situation and come to a conclusion ? #% In 2002 and 2003 , over 300 dolphins and porpoises were washed ashore and their carcasses could be seen on beaches . #% To add insult to injury , the Commission then went to the press with its plans for anti-dumping duties on leather shoes before even the Member States received the proposals , let alone this Parliament . #% In one respect , I would like to make a request for more flexibility . #% There is a lesson here , too , for older Member States . #% Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry , EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law . #% The key word now is ` transparency ' in every sector , whether it is public procurement , the appointment of officials and magistrates or whether it concerns the reasons why a particular investigation is suddenly stopped dead in its tracks . #% That is a very worrying sign for the European Union . #% It can not create jobs just by government spending . #% I thank all the rapporteurs for their work and congratulate them all on producing three well-balanced reports . #% We must show , for instance , that we understand the difference between religion that is moderate , reasonable and compassionate and the dogmatic fundamentalism that exists in all religions , not just Islam . #% The human rights situation in those countries has improved dramatically and in the Baltic States with the build-up of the mixed economic system . #% That is something to be welcomed . #% If companies are held back from taking the key decisions necessary perhaps for the very survival of those businesses , their problems will get worse , which means that more employees could suffer . #% You press the button , you move your mouse , you make a conscious decision . #% Also , the Commission should undertake conflict impact assessment in regions of instability to ensure that we can protect vulnerable groups and communities . #% Of course we need to go for an agreement . #% A combination of mismanagement , unfair competition and poor judgement has threatened the success of this most vital of European industries . #% It would be far better if the House concentrated on its statutory duties , rather than poking its nose into areas which are none of its business . #% This report comes from the German perspective at the centre of Europe , ideally placed no matter which way they drive . #% I am , however , completely in favour of legislation to protect the public from the highly toxic substance that mercury is , but the approach that we should take on environmental issues must be proportionate and it must be balanced . #% If there was qualified majority voting and codecision with this Parliament , neither clause - I am sure - would be in this text since a more progressive majority would have prevailed . #% There are some materials that do indeed need a lot more work on them , or if you look at the area of glass and metal perhaps less work . #% Mr President , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again . #% If you had asked for my advice , I would have explained how that system worked . #% Mr President , I should like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his statement . #% It is fundamental to the health and safety of our people . #% In particular , I ask the House that if a herbal medicine has been used anywhere in the world for more than 30 years and there was clear evidence that its normal use is safe , then we should not deny it to the people we represent . #% You later said that such action would be contrary to European Union law . #% Andrew has been in prison in Greece for six months awaiting trial on a manslaughter charge which seems to be based on mistaken identity and , I am afraid to say , police brutality to witnesses , and I believe the European Arrest Warrant has been misused . #% The principle is one we strongly support but we believe it can be more effectively enforced if Member States retain the power to establish their own charging systems appropriate to their own circumstances . #% But harmonisation must respect subsidiarity - we have no need to rush towards uniformity of civil law in this area of product liability . #% I really think that we should give the House the opportunity to vote on the other amendments as put forward there . #% This lady just took notes , which was not very satisfactory , but it was better than nothing . #% India poses equal , if distinct , challenges for the EU and the Commission must reflect that as it lays out its new strategy by working with stakeholders to mirror its China consultation . #% After a year , at the end of their working lives , the scrawny near-naked birds are slaughtered and turned into pies , soup or petfood . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by apologising for Mr Bradbourn 's absence from this debate . #% This leads to the break-up of families and is designed purely to drive from their homes the few remaining Greek Cypriots in the northern part of Cyprus , which is currently controlled by Turkish authorities . #% Agencies should get some sort of recompense if the temporary worker is taken on by the user company . #% I would also like to make an appeal to the Liberal Group . #% I wonder if the President-in-Office foresees any further progress on this issue during the remainder of his presidency , and whether he could try and put a timescale on how much progress we can make in bringing forward this idea ? #% Before Christmas we had the strange outbursts from the Commission spokesperson in relation to the case concerning the collective selling of UK football premiership TV rights , and this tactic has been repeated in the Commission 's ongoing anti-trust investigation into Microsoft . #% We would agree as well - and are pleased to see it there - that we need to be adopting more of a life course approach that deals with the different rhythms and patterns of modern working lives , both positive and negative . #% I wonder whether the US will stand . #% Mr President , yesterday , in one of his rare speeches , Mr Tomlinson referred to the sovereignty of the House in coming to decisions . #% Very soon we will be faced with the proposal to revise the TENs network in its entirety . #% The two things are closely related . #% What good Europeans , really good Europeans , would do , is provide an alternative to help the Greeks re-establish their own currency , to allow them to devalue , to let them renegotiate their debts , because their debt-to-GDP ratio has passed the point of no return . #% Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . - Mr President , I do not think that the Commission has cleared it up terribly well , but I think it is not withdrawing its proposal , and so we need to clarify the legal situation . #% It is an important issue for citizens , it is an important issue for many of us here in this House and it is important that it is debated at Seattle . #% We are ineffective , dysfunctional and we are letting our citizens down . #% It seems to me unacceptable that the Commissioners can be the executive of the EU without having the responsibility that goes with it . #% I believe that UN Security Council Resolution 1970 only specifically bans the sale of arms to the Jamahiriya and , therefore , not to the Benghazi rebels , though unfortunately the EU legislation appears to transpose 1970 incorrectly , with a blanket arms embargo . #% The rights under the Treaty are not conditional in my view . #% We will get another chance to do that when we debate the transport of nuclear material , when the Commission sees fit to bring their report to the Transport Committee . #% This will do much to boost the EU 's Lisbon Strategy . #% For example , many consumers in Europe have credit cards , and some have two , three or four . #% Only last week I launched a brilliant LEADER II project in a small place called Swanton Morley where all levels of the public and private sectors have come together to benefit the hard-pressed village . #% There is other legislation under way . #% There are many people in this Parliament and in Europe who believe that at some stage it will be essential for Spain - however regrettable , however much it dislikes the idea - to enter into a dialogue . #% Parliament should not be fobbed off by the Commission 's willingness to submit an annual report . #% We urgently need this legislation on the quality and safety of tissues and cells across Europe . #% So near , Mr President , but so far , and again initiatives relating to the economies of Member States must be clearly understandable to ordinary people . #% However , I reach a different conclusion that does not deny that the 17th Constitutional Amendment represents a return to democracy ; that President Musharraf is supporting the bill on the Hudood Ordinances and action against so-called honour killings ; that Mr Hashmi was tried in an independent court , he will appeal and that the appeal to the higher court against exile by his own party leader was recently successful . #% In conclusion , I do not think I voted for Mr Vitorino . #% 
Let me deal directly with the Commission 's core proposal , the setting of a target for 2010 of 120 mg per cubic metre for ozone , not to be exceeded on more than 20 days per year . #% These EUR 2 million are taken from line 19 05 01 ` Cooperation with industrialised non-member countries ' . #% While we are looking at the role of the institutions I would also like to reinforce Conclusion 11 of Mr Koukiadis 's report which mentions the Council 's ` lack of enthusiasm ' - very tactfully put I felt - with regard to the Committee on Petitions . #% We need a light-touch regulatory framework , with bilateral tax agreements , which will ensure the portability for those EU nationals wishing to work abroad throughout the Union , achieve a genuine single market in financial services and provide maximum choice to the European investor . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , we can set all the targets under the sun for tackling climate change but we will not reach them , especially the longer-term targets for 2050 , unless we invest deeply and systematically in developing and improving sustainable low-carbon technology . #% But I urge Parliament to pause for a moment and think seriously about what alternatives there are to these very useful flame retardants . #% The consequences would be that the vast majority of meat products in our shops would be labelled as having been derived from genetically modified organisms . #% The actions of one man and his regime have destroyed 5000 years of unbroken human civilisation , causing the worst humanitarian tragedy since the Second World War , according to the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights of Iraq . #% Here it states and I quote : `` deplores most strongly the residual impression left by these cases , whereby it would appear that favouritism plays a significant role in the granting of appointments to high-grade posts within the administration of Parliament '' . #% My answer , and the answer of the PPE-DE group is : not yet . #% It is capable , with the use of activity-based budgeting and management , of being implemented in the European Commission , on time , provided that we get the necessary support from elsewhere . #% In our joint motion with the PPE-DE Group we urge the proper respect of the SGP . #% This should include financial encouragement to use both land already in use and the additional land in an environmentally friendly way with reduced inputs and encouragement for woodlands where appropriate . #% In the commercial sector , just-in-time delivery systems , the backbone of modern-day supply for industry , will be jeopardised . #% Clearly it is only possible to deal with such a caseload with a procedure which combines the advantages of individual examination of cases , speedy processing and compliance with the principle of collective responsibility applied in the Commission . #% ( Mixed reactions ) I know that some people claim there is a difference between abstaining and being present in the Chamber and not voting . #% The EU is failing to listen to developing countries and is pursuing its own business agenda with extraordinary arrogance . #% Europeans deserve a more balanced and socially responsible policy approach . #% Mr President , this is one of the most important documents we will be debating in the field of the environment in this parliamentary cycle . #% When can we expect these two regulations to be passed ? #% I am privileged to have been part of the Cars 21 initiative from the very beginning , and we are now seeing the impact of that integrated approach . #% We call on the Commission to ensure genuine decentralisation in the development and implementation of programmes . #% Perhaps the result of this , as far as NEPAD is concerned , for instance in relation to our last debate , is the modest reference in NEPAD to any kind of social sector issue . #% All over the European Union - indeed all over the world - policy-makers are concerned about the costs of health care and there is a temptation to make drugs available over the counter that ought more properly only to be prescribed by a doctor or a pharmacist . #% The gap between the governors and the governed is now a gaping chasm . #% In so doing , I would also like to pay tribute to the joint secretariats of our Parliament and the Assembly , the interpreters and staff who accompany us , and the Commissioners , officials and members of the presidency who attend . #% When it comes to the production of generic medicines , I am glad that ACTA protects copyrights and trademarks while excluding patents from border measures , so you avoid the seizure of generic medicine in transit through the EU . #% I shall be putting forward an oral amendment , which tries to bring this resolution up to date , because there is a cease-fire at the moment brokered by Rwanda , the OAU and the United States . #% The better they can regulate and monitor themselves , the better we , the politicians , will be satisfied . #% We agree with : the rejection of neoliberal economic policies ; the need for greater social justice ( though we might differ on definitions ) ; and criticism of the evasion , incoherence and inadequate answers of some Commissioners . #% The proposal is intended to protect the providers of these services . #% The Council and Commission must have a fresh determination to get a result . #% Would there be a risk of us perhaps being taken to the WTO on the extent of anti-dumping measures or support ? #% Secondly , I would like to send my condolences to the people of Moscow for the recent atrocious suicide bomb attack on their metro , which resulted in at least 39 deaths and 150 casualties , with everything pointing to Chechen terrorists organised by a Saudi al-Qa ` ida follower . #% If they can not do it on that , what is to say they will do it on this ? #% When we were in Hong Kong , Rob Portman seemed never to be able to negotiate . #% We should not be demanding that the whole stockpile be put up the chimney at once . #% A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will , therefore , be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management . #% If we can vote today , the college of Commissioners , as I understand it , could consider the matter this afternoon . #% Finally , we must also bear in mind that we should not be too concerned about the harmony of the process but about the effectiveness of the outcome . #% The real desire is to create something separate from NATO . #% That is something we need to be aware of and bear in mind . #% I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes . #% I must say that , in general terms , the ambitions of the Chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee , my co-rapporteur , have largely been met . #% On behalf of the Committee on Development , I want to stress four points in particular . #% I hope that today in the vote later in this plenary we can once and for all put an end to this issue and put an end to unnecessary animal suffering . #% Commissioner , it is time someone in this debate sounded a note of congratulations . #% This is not a constantly elastic process . #% It is clear as well that governments can not afford to do everything and , therefore , a liberalization agenda is required so that we can combine both public and private capital in order to improve the information society that we are developing here in Europe . #% Instead , we need to tackle these matters as individual states and take tougher measures to discourage traffickers and bogus asylum seekers . #% On that issue the European Council itself recognized that it has to return to the issue at least as regards the weighting of the votes and the size of the Commission . #% He referred to a number of texts on the definition of privacy and he referred to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which guarantees the protection of privacy and family life . #% But that is another matter . #% I have to disagree with my colleague Mrs Fourtou . #% Will he give us his assurance that the presidency will make sure that this continues ? #% Yes , Commissioner , I know the Council is not here , but I do not give up on one Council . #% In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25 % of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered . #% When it is time for change then it is the time for change and that time is now . #% We saw passengers being left stranded at destinations , without accommodation or even a flight home . #% Furthermore , whenever Europe has to face up eyeball to eyeball to the challenges posed by competitiveness , we funk it . #% I am pleased that our own legal services - who say Parliament must be very wary of attempts from representatives of other institutions to limit our powers - have confirmed that there is nothing in the rules to stop us having a parliamentary inquiry , so long as the terms of reference differ from any question before the courts in a Member State . #% It seems odd that the Court of Justice rules that our opinion may not be necessary . #% As a parliament we are duty-bound to disapprove of such activities . #% I would hope that until such time as the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities has been able to pronounce , after all due consideration , the decision that was reported yesterday will be held in abeyance . #% Obviously human resources are a central part of all human healthcare systems , but the reality is that the recruitment of health professionals and the scourge of HIV/Aids are continuing to prolong the crisis already afflicting very fragile healthcare systems in developing countries . #% That is the greatest service it could provide to the Tamils and all the people of Sri Lanka . #% 
My one plea , without going back over old ground , is that I hope that the issue of the United Kingdom rebate does not find itself becoming part of a separate set of negotiations about the future of Europe following the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands this week . #% In future we shall want to give the competition mergers department , more work , because the market should play an even bigger role in telecoms than it does at the moment . #% We must provide for those incoming Member States the tremendous opportunities it is currently providing for our students . #% Mr President , I wish to protest at the decision of Mr Berretta , the chief executive officer of Eutelsat , to discontinue the contract for New Tang Dynasty Television , a US-based global channel that is the only free uncensored Chinese-language broadcaster to reach mainland China , much to the anger of the Communist government there . #% We have to address them all if we are serious about a European defence identity . #% Reflecting on the recommendations made by my Committee , I realise that almost all of these were taken up , which is an unusual situation . #% One important point I would like to make is that great care has been taken in our amendments not to reinvent the wheel . #% By contrast , countries outside the EU will not be subject to the Greens ' Pantomime of the Ents , if you remember those characters in the Lord of the Rings . #% As you know , we spend an enormous amount of time voting on Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday lunchtimes . #% So much `` Spam '' email is sent . #% I shall explain why shortly . #% That process has now been unlocked and I am delighted by the achievements we have made . #% I would like the Council to be aware that since then we Members have received an enormous outpouring of confidence that things will progress . #% Can I just say that I would like to congratulate Mrs Lindeperg on what is a very good and comprehensive report . #% Madam President , much of the United Nations report refers to the role of Zimbabwean interests and gives startling evidence of how the actions of Mugabe 's corrupt henchmen impact not just on their own people but also on neighbouring countries such as the Congo . #% For Member States the question is not one of how aid can best be coordinated , but one of donor competition : how far they can buy influence by being the biggest donors in particular situations . #% Madam President , my congratulations to the rapporteur for a very fine report , which I know we will all support . #% Secondly , the Commission in its avis identified certain weaknesses , particularly in relation to the structure of the economy . #% I would like to hear what the Commissioner thinks of Amendment 36 . #% Let us come back to what we said in the Berger resolution and have a five-year deal , allowing the Commission and Parliament to review it in 2011 . #% I do not think that any of us here can go too far in showing our concern about the handling and the transport of toxic waste , especially radioactive material . #% As my speech has suggested , the report could easily have been a lot stronger , and the ECB has got off fairly lightly this year . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , illegal immigration is a problem , which is made worse by the free movement of peoples . #% Therefore , the delivery mechanisms will not greatly affect the way in which these services are delivered or consumed . #% The committee 's amendments have strengthened the text quite considerably . #% The institutions of the Union have come together to set out the principles of food law in the shape of a new authority which can safeguard the food we eat and the way it is produced . #% We ask you to look again at the wording of Amendment No 5 and we ask you to reply on the issue of comitology . #% Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner a question about what he has just said . #% I fear that neither exhortation will actually achieve as much of an impact as the decisions of workers themselves . #% I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Danesin , for his cooperative and comprehensive approach , which has secured widespread support , not just throughout this Parliament , but indeed throughout the industry itself . #% We have been able to ask the Commission - and it has agreed - for a proper screening process to be established by 30 April 2007 so that we can have a substantive justification for staff increases over the next few years . #% That is precisely the objective of explanations of vote , that we have just sat through now . #% In this respect , is there not a salutary lesson to those of us who debate and legislate here ? #% Especially when it came to issues such as the scope , it seemed to be a one-size-fits-all directive , with the same rules for all sorts of funds - not just hedge funds and private equity but also investment trusts in the UK , which have existed for 150 years with no systemic risk . #% We all know there will be people waiting in airport lounges this summer asking , why their plane is delayed , not for minutes but for hours . #% But we must be clear that , if a second resolution is forthcoming from the UN , we must all support it because that is what we have stated very clearly in our resolutions in this Parliament . #% The issue of timescales of the application procedure has proved a problematic factor in the discussions on this issue and it has been of some concern particularly among the pharmaceutical industries . #% I wish to put that on the record in the minutes . #% What should be discussed at the summit on Friday is Portugal . #% In the circumstances of a committee of inquiry report where there is no possibility , in line with our Rules , to table amendments , I can not in all conscience vote in favour of the report . #% That is almost EUR 1 million we are spending on statistics alone . #% To be fair , some of these deficiencies have been addressed , but conciliation failed to successfully address many key concerns . #% Experience from Spain , Greece and Portugal suggests that given time and economic growth the transition from dictatorship to free market democracy is achievable everywhere in Europe . #% Europe will not succeed unless you do this . #% But I personally offer my support to the idea of bringing this directive in line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals . #% I should like to ask that that be reprinted so that we can see these people who voted against giving women enhanced rights in sex discrimination cases . #% Mr President , bearing in mind that I am otherwise speaking for my current political group in this debate , I hope you will excuse me if I make two personal comments on these matters . #% The result is the destruction of another species in Antarctica and its waters , which has a very fragile environment and , ironically , where the world has decided to preserve the resources on land but has yet to make similar decisions in its oceans . #% Experienced seafarers are also ideal for other temporary , onshore work off-season in areas such as recruitment , training , freight forwarding , insurance and arbitration . #% And so we should . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on this report . #% That is hardly a very good start for someone who is pledging to show international leadership on the issue of climate change . #% Diseased pigs were not reported - bad farming practice . #% If it affects Internet banking , as they suggest , then there must be other ways that they can verify the credentials of people who are applying for accounts . #% Justice Minister Cicek promised us that in the next package of constitutional reforms , which I think is to be published this week , the State Security Courts would be scrapped . #% This is crucial , because if there is not a parallel emissions charge or multiplier formula to cover aviation 's non-CO2 impacts , the effect of buying the right to emit a tonne of CO2 from another sector with much lower non-CO2 impacts would actually be a net disbenefit to the environment . #% Too far , too fast ! #% Mr President , I do not wish to add to what our rapporteur has said apart from thanking him and expressing the support of our group for his work in producing this report modifying the arrangements for complying with GATT . #% I fully support the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey this autumn . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his support for Parliament 's subcommittee in his speech this afternoon . #% Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated . #% We all have ardent advocates of various priorities knocking at doors with special needs . #% We want the ACP to be the centre of the dialogue and , as others have said , the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has an important role to play and assists us in focusing the Commission 's mind on the views of the ACP and of ACP parliamentarians . #% in writing . - The British Conservative Delegation strongly supports the principle of free trade . #% Whilst very regrettable , the cull was perceived at the time as the most effective measure to end the outbreak . #% The shared aim of all of us is to try to find a balanced way of protecting consumers and shielding SMEs from differing Member State jurisdictions . #% 
Third , a strong civil society is part of a healthy democracy , providing scrutiny of governments and promoting principles of anti-corruption and good governance . #% Having just finished a major reform treaty process , a reform package , we are told , would close the book on treaty change for a generation . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , last week in the United Kingdom , Lord Davies delivered his speech to the government on how to increase women 's participation in the boardroom . #% It is for this very reason that any attempt at harmonisational convergence throughout the EU should be opposed . #% On the other hand , funding of political parties as such remains excluded from the scope of the draft regulation . ' #% Now we see in Benue and Taraba in east and central Nigeria tribal , not religious , wars . #% One of the areas we worked on in this conciliation was that of measures that will encourage Member States to get these directives to work properly . #% In a reply just the other day , the Commission admitted that little progress had been made . #% I say to my colleague , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , that it is a label she should accept with pleasure and a badge which she should wear with pride . #% With the increased mobility of tourism , educational visits and business travel , the need for cross-border consumer rights is magnified . #% It is a positive step in building ever-closer relations between Europe and China , an important boost for jobs and an important boost for those of us who want to see a renaissance of Europe 's maritime trade . #% On the different categories , on Category 1 I would agree with the President-in-Office when she said that agricultural expenditure should be based on up-to-date facts . #% There is nothing about protecting the interests of the hapless , innocent citizen who might get caught up in the nightmare of a Europol investigation . #% Mr President , we have tried to work closely with Mr Cunha and the other rapporteurs to ensure that when we take the final vote on this we comply with Rule 63a of our Rules of Procedure . #% Worldwide , this is something like over 3 800 African elephants , over 2 600 rare leopards and 9 000 bears . #% One is the somewhat dilatory attitude to disciplinary procedures within the Commission itself but that is no ground for a vote of censure . #% That is going on in the successful companies . #% Second , could Mr Sasi confirm that the presidency will come forward with new proposals to facilitate the fullest possible provision to the European Parliament of documents discussed in the 133 Committee in the Council , accompanied , if necessary , by special procedures to protect confidentiality ? #% Mr President , for me - not a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - it is quite extraordinary that the effect of these proposals on developing country producers and markets has barely received any attention in this debate . #% I commend my own two reports , and that of Mr Clegg , to the House . #% Guaranteeing better access to public procurement contracts for innovative small and medium-sized enterprises is essential . #% in writing . - I have been consistently supportive of Turkey 's accession process while fully aware of serious concerns that have to be addressed . #% We suggest how LIFE + could be significantly strengthened . #% I find the language that is used fascinating . #% I accept that developed countries like my own have a humanitarian responsibility to people from third countries who have faced or would face persecution , torture or death if they were to return . #% Many colleagues felt that there should be a specific extension of this to satellite and conditional access systems . #% There are significant problems with a directive that penalises wholly unintentional conduct , and I hope the Commission and Council will accept the safe harbours put forward by Mr Goebbels in the compromises , which are based on a safe harbour for acceptable market practice . #% From a consumers ' point of view , the common position is to be welcomed . #% Coherence : I like the idea that a large proportion of the money in the Senegal agreement will be spent on development . #% The first of these I would pick out is the European Medicines Evaluation Agency , where new drugs -- orphan drugs , pharmacovigilance , herbal medicines and so on -- are piled on top of its initial responsibilities , but the funding is static . #% It is particularly important that you do this on behalf of the whole European Parliament and as you represent a Member State that is not involved on either side . #% By funding research into renewable energies , this report shows itself to be balanced and environmentally sound . #% Of course , MEPs spent many years calling for the closure of Guant√°namo , so we warmly welcome the announcement by President Obama and we understand the difficulties in unravelling the mess left by George Bush . #% The initial suggestion from the Commission was that we should limit this dosing to cement used for manual use . #% Given that both sides have agreed , in principle , to review the implementation of the ceasefire agreement , is the EU , as co-chair of the peace process , planning on taking this opportunity to push for a human rights declaration signed by both the government and the LTTE in order to put the protection of fundamental human rights at the heart of the peace process ? #% That is premature . #% Mr President , perhaps the most important decision the Irish presidency faces is the choice of Mr Prodi 's successor as President of the Commission . #% We have to look where we are and , following the agreement that we were relieved to receive from Florence on the framework programme , there has been considerable progress . #% Mention tourism and they leave their brains to broil on the beach . #% I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his enlightening reply . #% She should also consider coordinating the OSCE , the EU and particularly the CSDP and NATO within the partnership for peace . #% We need to be able to sort out this problem and look at it very practically . #% Indeed , as the Prime Minister said in his letter , Romania has vigorously addressed this issue . #% Although we have cadmium in the environment , the source of cadmium from batteries is not significant . #% It sends a clear message to the IGC to be ambitious , to think long-term and not short-term , to think of how a Union with nearly double the number of Member States we have now can actually function effectively and to take this opportunity to change the Treaties , because future IGCs with nearly 30 states around the table will find it even more difficult than it is now to agree on reforms . #% However , there are still certain points of difference between the Socialists and the Christian Democrats that go beyond nuance . #% I broke the law of England , Her Majesty 's customs officers treated me fairly , and I paid the penalty . #% The Daphne programme is designed to give added value to the work of NGOs dealing with prevention , supporting the victims , reintegrating the survivors and dealing with the perpetrators . #% This is not unilateralism . #% The criminals do not worry about issues of subsidiarity and frontier controls and whether the niceties of national law versus European law are properly abided by - they operate in whatever way makes them the biggest profit and achieves their objectives . #% Our colleague 's report on that matter addresses and makes the very best of a very bad situation . #% The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wisely chose Mr Maat to prepare this report , which largely succeeds in reconciling animal welfare with the economics of farming . #% Why is it that I am being lobbied by the biggest single user of sugar in the world , a US company , specifically to get the price down ? #% Secondly , I wish to echo those who have supported the parliamentary dimension of this process . #% In terms of the overall budget , I can support the current position of the British Government , as well as a number of other governments , and believe that it should be capped at 1 % of the total national income of the Union . #% Can he answer the last part of my question which is under what circumstances , should the appeal go the other way in the United States , would the Commission withdraw and ensure that the panel is not revived ? #% I see this particular proposal as an interim measure towards a European policy that actually bans discarding altogether . #% Action on these substances in the opinion of many Members of this Parliament has been long delayed due to the slow progress of the risk assessments undertaken under the existing substance regulations of 1993 . #% Mr President , it has been , as always , a pleasure to work with my friend Bill Miller on these technical directives and I believe that we will have made a significant improvement to this directive if it is approved . #% The current administrative reform is not a limited exercise - it is an evolutionary process as we have made very clear - it will be continuously monitored and the results achieved will be assessed in order to provide for any relevant adjustments . #% But I do not see any evidence of this and it is not what I am hearing at meeting after meeting either . #% We would therefore request that the debate be wound up with a resolution . #% We can not simply accept assurances from friendly governments concerning the prohibition on torture and cruel and degrading treatment : we have a responsibility to ensure that we and our allies act within international law . #% One of the main aims of education is to provide for the world of work as well as providing a cultural base for Europe 's young people . #% If that was true for America then , it is certainly true for Europe now . #% I am certain that my colleagues who are specialists in this area will be pleased to give him the information he seeks on a future occasion . #% 
Some two thousand homes were affected and hundreds of families are now living in temporary accommodation . #% What answer would the Commissioner give to companies in my own constituency such as J.W. Wilkinson of Kendal and Stead McAlpine of Carlisle who very much fear that the imposition of such high duties on grey cloth will create unemployment , inflation and irreparable damage to the textile industry , not only in the UK but across the European Union ? #% The IDPs in Sudan are reporting very clearly to NGOs -- and British NGOs are reporting to me -- that they are identifying Arab militias that are now being absorbed into the army of the Government of Sudan and trained as soldiers . #% For this reason alone , supported also by the well-known UN resolutions and the reference which has already been made to the constant violation of human rights , Kashmir is no longer a problem that can be swept under the carpet and not debated in this Parliament , as has happened for many years . #% I am told that if I say anything which upsets you , then the microphone will be cut off . #% A high-level action plan , Mr President , that does not recognise these fundamental reports is - I would argue - not worth the paper it is written on . #% I have given the Commissioner notice of these questions . #% There is some confusion in certain quarters on that . #% Lastly , by adopting this directive , the EU will reinforce and bolster the explicit signal that it gave when signing up to the Kyoto protocol : that it is a responsible and key world player in the environmental domain . #% which is on the agri-monetary system for the single market , 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 . #% If we fail in this project then I think it will impede any further development we want to see in the future of the EU . #% The EU has a special responsibility in negotiating on the Chair 's Statement , and I hope the Council will confirm today that it will postpone producing a draft text until the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has produced recommendations for this year . #% Let us have a look at some of those barriers . #% I would have liked , as rapporteur , to have had something more specific , drawing attention to the burdens imposed on employers , because we did draw attention in our resolution , paragraph 8 , to the need to reduce non-wage labour costs , particularly at the lower end of the wage scale . #% All of these things are necessary , not just one or two - all of those things are necessary . #% Mr President , I am delighted that I do not have to play cards against Mr Rehn , because he holds his cards so close to his chest and plays his trump card -- his last card -- at the very last minute ! #% So said Barack Obama on 21 January 2009 . #% Is an urgent matter because the New Delhi Conference , to which the question refers , is now beginning . #% We must revise the GPS in order to make sure that we not only help the poor trade their way out of poverty , but also help the hopeless trade their way out of the rubble of disaster . #% Advertising which makes a real comparison between real qualities in an objective way serves the interests of the consumer , and it should be seen as such . #% It will not be easy to implement this directive and I am not referring to the votes . #% The precautionary principle is very sensibly described in a recent Commission paper . #% Some of the opportunities of this nascent market , which we are now seeing emerge in the European Union , will be affected by some of the suggestions being made . #% There is greater clarity concerning cross-border healthcare , and the European Court of Justice decisions on the criteria concerning medical necessity are there . #% We do not for a moment question that all these directorates have their own responsibilities , but we would ask Commissioner Bangemann and his colleagues to tell us that the consumer voice and the consumer interest should always be taken into account - formally so - when legislation concerning food and food safety is before the Commission and this Parliament . #% The network of agencies that are perhaps in danger of tripping over themselves in south-east Europe is a challenge we have to resolve . #% Mr President , I speak in support of my colleague , Mrs Junker , who has spoken on behalf of the Group . #% Above all , despite the efforts of some Members of this Parliament , I hope that we will learn the lessons from the outbreak of this disease and ensure that it never happens again . #% Let us not underestimate the danger this posed as , had it succeeded in killing the assembled government ministers and opposition leaders , it could have heralded a war between India and Pakistan , both nuclear powers with massive conventional land forces as well - although India has at least declared a policy of no first use of its nuclear arsenal , unlike Pakistan . #% The date of implementation of these new arrangements , and indeed much else , will therefore depend to a very significant extent on the speed at which they are handled in this House and in the Council . #% I would like to pick up on some further enhancements that we have made as a result of the second reading . #% I would add that this House , as one of the institutions of the European Community , should certainly not be shy of allowing the ombudsman to investigate our procedures . #% I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this . #% The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle . #% The parliamentary assembly is a very special institution : it is the democratic arm of ACP-EU cooperation and provides a voice for the people in the 93 countries which are represented there . #% This trust is precisely the quality that is needed so that we are able to ensure the successful accession of the new Member States . #% Mr Haider has demonstrated , over the past years by both words and deeds , that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse . #% In our resolution today , we are calling upon all parties to the conflict and troubles in Sri Lanka to pull back from the brink . #% A prime objective of the Development Committee is to ensure that the Global Health Fund has a significant amount of money . #% Historically , that research found that the euro actually swooped between a high of USD 1.70 in December 1979 and a low of just USD 0.69 in February 1985 . #% I believe the committee ' s most fundamental contribution to this debate will be the introduction of the reference of such B to C disputes to ADR or EDR . #% In its initial assessment of the potential FTA between the EU and India , the Centre for the Analysis of Regional Integration at Sussex concluded that any gains would depend on the extent to which the text identified and dealt with the key areas which the Commissioner specifically mentioned , such as government procurement , services , investment in trade facilitation , etc. . #% There are some really important contributions from many colleagues but , frankly , and I say this to the Commission and Commissioner Barnier , this also reflects the nature of the EU 2020 document . #% We in the European Parliament want to help them not just to survive , but to thrive . #% I am disappointed that there was a small majority in this House in favour of excluding this important human rights principle . #% Developed countries need to contribute to a rapid and lasting recovery in these countries and the EU has a key role to play in this respect . #% Reinsurance is a global business and EU firms are in the lead , so a global marketplace in which firms have access to markets on an equal basis is needed . #% I am , as your rapporteur , informed that to retro-fit a black box to a ferry undergoing a refit would cost a lot less than new carpets or curtains . #% It is a perfect example of one of the benefits of enlargement -- of our welcoming ten new Member States -- that we have representatives with such strength and wisdom to improve the quality of our discussions . #% We now have the very dangerous involvement of the European Convention in defence matters . #% I rarely speak in debates after summits but this is an important one . #% Worryingly , Saudi Arabia 's brand of fundamentalism , Wahabi Islam , is being exported globally . #% Climate-friendly alternatives exist for almost all applications , or are in development . #% China is also helping to put pressure on North Korea against that country 's quest to build its own nuclear weapons . #% Mr President , I think that we are all agreed that what we need is more consistent application of the 1985 directive across the European Union . #% The key is to get the test and any alternatives to existing tests into Annex 5 of the dangerous substances directive . #% I would like to say to him that it is not through lack of effort on our part that it has taken a long time to get this question on the agenda . #% This is not an instrument for adding new provisions . #% We showed it to the Belgian members and they did not like the look of that at all . #% I think I am the last speaker from Parliament before the rapporteur and the Commission and I just want to make three fundamental points . #% We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union , and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate , with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country . #% Therefore , we welcome the Commission proposals : doubling the checks , coordinating the calculations , improving driver training and modernizing the tachograph . #% There will be a meeting of the EU-African Union Foreign Ministerial Troika on 1 April , and we hope that the EU will put it high on the agenda . #% There is still a lot of work to be done by the candidate countries , we still have a ratification process , and this Parliament will take its assent powers very seriously indeed . #% It is possible to do it when we need to . #% Will she accept that there is some merit in the principle of having a programme run by associations of local authorities themselves , which have good contacts , rather than by private consultants ? #% 
The insistence that Member States remind producers of the need to comply with environmental legislation is particularly welcomed by British Conservatives . #% Finally , I welcome Mrs Lalumi√®re 's call for a Commissioner for human rights and a Centre for the Active Prevention of Conflicts , which is well overdue . #% However , we are not here to discuss the rights and wrongs of his socio-economic policies or indeed the internal politics of Venezuela . #% This proposal will enhance our Community and national ability to look after public health throughout the European Union . #% For some strange reason , those agencies have not lobbied us . #% A strict reading of the Maastricht Treaty does permit them to qualify , as verified by the Commission , EMI and by the German Federal Court , an August body indebted to no one . #% Rather that than the arid scratchings of the bureaucratic Brussels pen-pusher . #% I am delighted to say that the Committee on Petitions had a recent meeting with the Danish presidency at which the presidency expressed its willingness to look at the new interinstitutional agreement . #% We heard from Mrs Halonen that the Commission has been asked to prepare a socio-economic programme for institution building in East Timor . #% Having said that , I will not support Amendments Nos 71 , 75 , 82 and 89 , concerning replacement engines , the classification of auxiliary engines and engines used to perform maintenance or construction work . #% We welcome the three-fold safeguards set out by the Commission in the form of economic safeguards , internal market safeguards and justice and home affairs safeguards . #% Do you really imagine that possible , especially as these proposals are based on German and French ideas of a social market ? #% We hope that we will see strategies -- and that is the next step -- that can deal with the root causes of the problem we are talking about this evening . #% Are you aware of the anger felt by citizens of this Union who seem to be regularly disrupted by these wildcat actions which are now taking place for the sixth summer running at the Channel ports ? #% I agree with the rapporteur that the definition should be broad . #% In April , we also have a massive rollover of Portuguese debt - another EUR 20 billion that has to rolled over . #% Firstly , refugees , which Mr Haarder touched on earlier . #% So we should not be fooled by the pro-F-gas lobbyists who argue both for avoiding a change of legal basis and for maintenance of the status quo for their climate-destructive products . #% However , pre-eminent for the Liberals seems to be laissez faire economic freedom for individuals to do in the economic marketplace whatever they want without too much concern about the effects on people with fewer entrepreneurial inclinations or abilities or less economic power . #% However , a Doha deal does not preclude bilateral WTO-plus arrangements . #% Those of you that are experts on the subject will clearly want to refer to the Commission 's own text and the Commission has provided an extremely helpful and clear explanatory statement for those of us who are not , unlike Lord Inglewood , distinguished lawyers - which is why he has been able to make such a good job of scrutinising this text on behalf of Parliament . #% Adolescent girls in Sub-Saharan Africa are 6 times more likely to be infected than boys of their age . #% How can a legally-binding document claim that all rights are equal - whether it is the right to life or the right to strike ? #% Parliament has no equivalent right . #% Touching upon the Galileo project , we need to maximise the use of the private sector . #% Mr President , the British countryside is at the moment in total crisis . #% We have to remember that , although fishing is a very small part of the European Union total gross domestic product , or however we should like to measure it , to those communities such as western France , Italy and Ireland , a few areas in the United Kingdom and some in Spain , fishing is about the only thing they have . #% Mr President , Mr Van Orden extends his apologies to the Commissioner . #% Furthermore , I believe that a common asylum system will weaken the accountability of British ministers and parliamentarians to the citizens who elect them . #% Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her report and to thank her for her openness to discussion on the issues involved . #% If we could do this more often , everybody 's life would be simpler . #% I know the details well , the good points as well as the bad . #% At the same time , we are under no illusions that much remains to be done . #% I thought we must have started Question Time to the Commission although it is only Monday . #% Now if we are looking at south-east Asia , can the Commissioner reassure me that somebody is still looking at what is happening in Brazil ? #% So there is a clear need for the interim government to rein in the security forces , to cease the mass arrests and to proceed to either charge or release those people arrested and to ensure due process . #% I should like to know whether a common list of military equipment is adopted in that code , how many licences have been refused and what progress the Council and Member States are making in this area ? #% I believe we are threatening the indigenous fisherman . #% Hopefully , with the support of the airlines and the work done by Mr Collins in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , things will now change for the better . #% I look forward to that era . #% I have to report that by 15 November no such communication had been received from the Commission . #% Yes , indeed we are special , we are public servants . #% This could be done at once . #% For them , as the Commissioner knows , the central problem is the shortage of competitively-priced exports . #% We need a European Union that is more effective and more democratic . #% I ask the House to support the amendment on orphan drugs that Mrs Haug has tabled on behalf of the Environment Committee , and to look very carefully at funding for the future in that area . #% This is an important subject , as all the other speakers have highlighted . #% These measures have to be taken immediately and the process of monitoring should thereafter be continuous . #% For our part , we support his dual approach of , firstly , trying to rationalise the hierarchy by broadly defining three categories of acts : constitutional acts , legislative acts and implementing measures . #% We want to see it concentrate on prevention as well as treatment of all three diseases . #% If so , I am sure that I can attribute the better parts to my friend and colleague Mr Dimitrakopoulos and the more unusual parts to Mr Leinen . #% However , we would disagree that there is a need for tax harmonisation on this issue . #% Millions of people are suffering worldwide . #% All too often these plans are coming in late and they are coming in lax . #% If we take the context of this report we will see that it has to stand on its own merits . #% I believe that the Commission -- in the past at least -- has given an unreasonably generous and wide interpretation of Article 296 . #% The British Conservatives will therefore vote against this resolution . #% The nurses have been in custody for more than six years now , and have been under sentence of death for over a year . #% Mr President , I endorse what the rapporteur , Mr Marinho , said . #% I agree and that is why it is so important we get it right . #% Thirdly , we should sort out what the role of MEPs is when they attend such conferences . #% Indeed , we find that in the UK two thirds of workers do not even know there is a limit to their working time . #% It is the right choice . #% That is a very disappointing reply . #% I will just mention a few of the proposals that we would like the Commission to consider . #% Has any expenditure at all been authorised by the Council or has everything been blocked ? #% 
All in all , we believe that the measures being undertaken fit well with the projected regionalisation of the common fisheries policy to which we are firmly committed , and we hope that proposals to this end will be put before Parliament soon . #% Since my son recently joined the British Royal Air Force , military intervention is no longer an intellectual debate but is now a personal issue for me . #% It should be recognised , Mr Walter , that certain countries will be less enthusiastic because of their position on the war , but I understand that the page has turned , and that those who are forward-looking in our Parliament -- and indeed those who support America in its hour of need -- will be supporting the PPE-DE Group 's amendment . #% Take a large successful business , add European regulations , and within months you have created a small one . #% In a press conference yesterday , he implicitly backed the principle of pre-emptive action on Iraq , saying that the simple restoration of weapons inspectors into Iraq may not be sufficient to avert war . #% So the health issues in favour of high tobacco taxes are not clear cut but , even more importantly , we do not believe in the upward harmonisation of excise duties or , in particular , the upward harmonisation of tobacco taxes . #% Why is it in favour of an EU project but wants to keep it from the people ? #% Without the investigative powers of Parliament , many of the problems with Thessaloniki and other institutions would not have been brought to light . #% The major thrust of the report is the demand for the doubling of the amount of renewable energy to 12 % by 2010 . #% Mr President , you just responded to Mr Wijsenbeek and stated that he was chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities . #% Finally , whilst I understand what he says about high standards of animal welfare already being regulated by EU legislation , this is not always enforced , as he is aware . #% We need to maintain our priorities . #% He really has been a splendid Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs . #% They were passed unanimously without any votes against , which I understand may be a rare if not unique event . #% The compliments are meant very sincerely . #% So we can set an example . #% Secondly we must make sure that our own inspectors have real powers equivalent to those of national inspectors and can enforce the uniformity that we all want . #% But we expect Parliament to be involved if these safeguard clauses are ever invoked . #% As socialists , we believe that it is essential to be compassionate and sympathetic in our approach . #% There has been a reluctance within the Commission to accept this own-initiative report . #% Finally , I thank the rapporteur again for taking a keen interest in the amendment concerning the European Court of Auditors . #% It may be understandable to our budget junkies in the Committee on Budgets , but for us normal human beings most of it is incomprehensible . #% I really need to be convinced that we are getting value for money out of the audiovisual observatory . #% The text is much more closely aligned with US EPO-proposed tier 4 limits and dates . #% No doubt we shall come back to this in future debates , but those were the main concerns raised by the Budgetary Control Committee . #% We do not have at this time a framework agreement between Commission and Parliament - that is still outstanding in the context of Annex III . #% It is absolutely ridiculous that Members of the European Parliament can not take part in debates . #% As a follow-up to the EU security strategy , it means developing a comprehensive EU disarmament and arms control strategy . #% Any revision of the financial regulatory framework must include proposals to improve the Capital Requirements Directive and therefore central to creating stable and responsible banks . #% I disagree with what Mr Purvis said . #% We have nervous consumers who are often nervous for no reason . #% There are others who see this as a skirmish in some kind of Manichean struggle between the public sector , which is good , and the private sector , which is bad . #% I only wish it were stronger . #% I think there is a big future for that . #% This is something for which we on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have campaigned hard with regard to farm products . #% The EU 's global role offers an important opportunity to promote our values in countries and regions where children 's rights are less well protected . #% Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months . #% What wisdom did it bestow ? #% The Commission 's proposal on tourism statistics has given us a good opportunity to revise the existing legal framework on the collection of statistical data on tourism in Europe . #% They are told there is no alternative to this ; it is a form of sado-monetarism , and it is sending them crazy . #% We therefore voted against the resolution . #% Some of us have received no e-mails since 11 O‚Äôclock this morning , except through webmail . #% Those are concerns people have about any nuclear energy . #% Can you indicate to us what the possible obstacles are ? #% But yet again the civil aviation industry has demonstrated its ability to be disunited on this important issue , with big airlines clamouring for a suspension while low-cost airlines and airports are demanding no suspension . #% Mr President , a few minutes ago we were called in this Parliament to observe a moment of silence in memory of those who died in the terrorism events in Spain and to remember all those of our constituents who have died from terrorism . #% As of today , there are eighty-six infringement proceedings against France , so this is not something new to France . #% The obstacles to this are in Presidential Decree 43/2003 , which states that international and local NGOs are not allowed to conduct activities contrary to the objectives of the military emergency conditions . #% It took considerable heavy lobbying of the other Groups to persuade their chairmen to change their minds and allow this report to be produced on the important subject we have in front of us today . #% As a result of the hard work of all those involved in this directive , but most notably the rapporteur , consumers no longer have a forlorn hope but a firm assurance that they will have the right measure of protection . #% One of our most important amendments would make the implementation of Free Trade Areas ( FTAs ) conditional on a prior in-depth sustainability impact assessment , to ensure that the FTA does not exacerbate inequalities among partners , and to establish mandatory rules to promote social justice and sustainability . #% Mr President , I also support the questions that my colleagues have asked the Commission , which are extremely important in terms of how we deal with the continuing crisis in Sudan , in the North-South negotiations as well as in Darfur . #% That approach , would actually reduce the prospects of any kind of funding from the pensions industry - an industry which , in the US is a major source of small business investment . #% Not only does this regulation build upon the judicial cooperation between the States it marks an attempt to put the citizen at the heart of the Europe - the citizen , not just big business , money brokers and others , with perhaps profit purely as their motive . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner very much . #% Colleagues will see that I have brought back an amendment to seek to achieve this . #% They agreed it by a majority . #% That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services . #% That is an untruth , and you do not have to be in anybody 's pocket to speak the truth in a democratic parliament . #% Mr President , in many ways it has been a rather grim year for the euro . #% Clearly , as other speakers have said , the European Union and its Member States have a very important role to play . #% We have this crisis because both were undermined in the past . #% I have no problem with that ; that is very good . #% A country that tolerates freedom of expression is a stronger country with better hope for the future . #% This will undercut the profits of legitimate pharmaceutical industries . #% Inside the EU a sole authority such as the ECB must be considered for reasons of coordinating strong actions when urgently required . #% 
We took this initiative some years ago , the Council has acted on our text , and indeed incorporated most of the essential elements that we wished to see incorporated into the uniform electoral system , or at least the common principles for the system . #% I hope the Transport Council will hear that message and that we will see some progress to make sure that road transport is covered , otherwise we see a real danger to the rail sector element of the revision to the general directive . #% For this reason , whatever the final form of Article 13 , I regard Amendments Nos 15 and 29 as being of the first importance . #% in writing . - The EU has ambitious plans , matched against a risk that resources will be increasingly constrained as populations around the globe demand more energy . #% We also had a report from Human Rights Watch only last week saying that , despite the efforts of authorities in Kurdistan , partisan security forces continue the practice of kidnap and torture , so there is no real safe area in Iraq . #% We would not wish all the burden of the cost of this measure to fall on operators or shippers in the private sector , but would seek a fair and equitable sharing of the burdens and costs involved . #% It says here that I asked the President to consider his interpretation of the Quaestors ' decision . #% The banning of the Fazilet party last year was a poor signal . #% He suggested that I said that the Court of Auditors stopped these contracts . #% I should like to remind you once again that I am referring to Rule 166 ( 1 ) and Rule 121 ( 2 ) . #% They tell us , and we have had discussions with them , about the importance -- also emphasised by the Commissioner -- their governments must attach to the priority of making sustainable management and conservation of natural resources a clear part of their national indicative programmes . #% We have , therefore , to learn to walk before we can run and we should be getting the basics right before we start constructing more ambitious models . #% There have been some criticisms about the blanket refusal to give access to legal opinions . #% Unfortunately her amendments were voted out by the PSE Group who were there in strength on Monday . #% At my own airport in Manchester there are Icelandic-registered aircraft and I have been to Iceland more times than they have . #% There is an additional impact on our environment and there is an additional stress on our citizens . #% That is the point I have tried to make , so it is far from ` one size fits all ' . #% Amendment 95 on the definition of the risk of absconding . #% Energy , transport and telecommunications are crucial to create the platform for economic success in Europe . #% A tidal barrage across the Severn Estuary in my own constituency could supply up to 10 % of Britain 's energy needs from a renewable green scheme with no CO2 emissions . #% However , the question certainly points out the problems : resources and publicity . #% So we need to develop training there , and we need to have a culture at work where you can admit to stress , have it dealt with seriously and work with working practices that promote mental wellbeing . #% President Barroso is quite correct in saying that we must make progress on policies , and a ` Messina 50 ' is probably a positive proposal , but what is the point of extending the period of reflection without providing a target and a purpose for the reflection ? #% Within the powers available to us , this Parliament is acting : creating new access facilities , supporting the code of conduct for employment of disabled people and campaigning for a new European disability programme which genuinely supports equal rights and integration . #% On the question of the size of the European Parliament , we have also found a point of equilibrium , based on to a minimum number of Members for each Member State . #% Mr President , Mr Ribeiro 's excellent report is on the second Commission proposal seeking to protect deep-water coral reefs from the effects of trawling . #% I also urge Russia to withdraw its troops from Transnistria , allow a peaceful reunification of Moldova and consign the Tiraspol gangster regime to the dustbins of history . #% That should not be a major factor , and I very much welcome these proposals . #% The idea that failing national economies should be given money to protect them from global realities is like giving a bottle of whisky to an alcoholic . #% If we have the right to call back in the way that is envisaged we will be able to delegate much more than we can now , knowing that we have the safety of being able to scrutinise and call back if necessary . #% They will in fact lose more in refining aid than we are preparing to give them to assist in their transition from this . #% We also have legislation for a balanced budget - the Pact for Stability and Growth . #% These are hugely important issues and we must make sure that our parliamentary response addresses them properly . #% However , it seems to me that their plight and the problems they suffer are the same , whether they are being persecuted by a government or simply fleeing disorder , civil war or chaos in society from which the authorities of their country are unable to protect them . #% We can not go beyond what they wish to see . #% Women in Portugal need help and advice on abortion , sexual health and reproductive rights . #% That surely is the key point . #% There are no clues . #% The problem for some of us , however , is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity . #% This is not an isolated event which is out of accord with the usual policies pursued by the Indonesian Government . #% It is pleasing to note that the German Ambassador to Romania last week opened the new embassy by laying the foundation stone and saying that this embassy will have no visa section . #% There are certain points in paragraphs 1 , 2 , 6 and 10 which we can not at the moment fully accept , although I must say that there is an enormous amount in this resolution with which we could all agree . #% In this respect , there are a number of sensible proposals contained in this report , including the strengthening of the independence of OLAF . #% Mr President , on behalf of Parliament , I ask you to make the strongest representations to the President of the Council expressing our disgust with this decision and seeking its reversal . #% These are modest , sensible proposals coming out of the working group of vice-presidents and Dagmar Roth-Behrendt , and I commend them to the House . #% But the fact is this prosecution should never have happened and the way it developed raised a lot of concerns about the treatment of defendants and trial standards . #% This is an issue crucially about import dependence on a range of fuels . #% Constitutionalising the Treaties and division into two parts is not acceptable to the EPLP , and the same concerns about unanimity apply here . #% I wonder if we have actually proofed some of the other policies that we came up with at this Spring Summit against those ambitions or , indeed , ambitions to encourage export credits that are consistent with sustainable development when certain Member States pay out over 50 % of their export credits to enable arms deals to go ahead . #% After many months of discussion , talks and negotiations with the Commission , the result has now been put forward to us in the form of the statement just made by Mr Prodi . #% Madam President , I should like to add my congratulations and conclude with a warning . #% We must not establish new preconditions for membership that were not applicable to other potential members and we must remain clear that negotiations are for full membership and that that is our only goal . #% I also want to thank the Danish presidency . #% I am pleased that Mrs Cederschi√∂ld makes such recommendations in her report and I personally and my group support these . #% It is fair to say that organised crime is still a problem , even in some of our current Member States , such as southern Italy . #% I hope that the House will agree to incorporate this point and that the House will also agree to the addition that the Member States should create an environment where employers are encouraged to take on workers . #% The Archbishop of Bulawayo has been threatened . #% If we are honest , we must admit that it has been a very long road from Luxembourg to Lisbon , and that really now we are looking for concrete achievements , for something to genuinely come out of this Lisbon Summit . #% The Council would learn far more there about how Europe is really working than at any number of closed Council meetings . #% This pandemic could hit the poorest countries hard as well . #% Firstly , the agreement that the new Commission should take office on 1 November . #% We call on him to end this futile crackdown , to release all political prisoners and instead to restore Belarus to the path of genuine , pluralist , multi-party democracy . #% It will be left to campaigners like Clean Clothes and No Sweat to make sure that labour and environmental standards are maintained . #% Madam President , it is customary on these occasions to congratulate the rapporteur on his work . #% The majority in this Parliament called two weeks ago for a suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , Commissioner , ROME II has been a long journey for us all and , whilst we might have hoped that this was the end , it seems likely that we are just at another staging post . #% 
The delay is unacceptable . #% Of course , they violate international fair trial standards , are not independent of the executive and evidence is withheld from the defence . #% There was an agreement on Tuesday night by all the political groups to change one word in paragraph 8 from ` integration ' to ` perspective ' , which brings it into line with the ENP Report , for which I was the rapporteur , and with Mr Brok 's report on enlargement . #% The main points worth stressing - and I speak for my whole group - are that we are now in a position where we can move beyond seeing advertising which makes direct comparisons as being somehow dangerous . #% We can help starve him of funds , which is as important a task as the military operation which we know will soon follow . #% Mr President , unlike Mr Moraes I was opposed from the very start to the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners , and it should stop right now in its tracks . #% I believe both of those are important aspects . #% It is , in their view , one of the most valuable tools available today in preventing accidents from happening , not just in learning from mistakes . #% I can , however , accept the one other new amendment by Mrs Thyssen , whose report we are also discussing and who has played a very constructive part in these debates . #% It is certainly a boom area for temporary work agencies in the UK . #% Therefore we need to have credibility , coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens . #% It is time for us to include something in that pact on growth so that it is not only in name a pact for stability and growth . #% However , next month , before we sit again in Strasbourg , the European football championship starts . #% We all know about the pressures exerted by teams to make sure you turn up for that overtime , whether you want to or not . #% The candidate countries are innocent bystanders in that debate and should not be penalised for having being pressured into making their views known . #% We have seen the political miracle of Nelson Mandela and his new South Africa . #% What have we to show for all this ? #% In Dublin , at the end of your presidency , we would like to see a determined practical commitment by the Council actually to reduce dramatically the numbers of young people on the unemployment market . #% The approach which has been taken is absolutely correct , not only in making sure that we do not simply give money away if we have a little spare in the budget , but also where we have asked the Secretary-General of Parliament to come forward with a number of reports : for example , in paragraph 6 of the resolution where we have asked the Secretary-General to look at and identify job needs in the same way as the Commission so that we can match job needs to the staff which we have available in the longer term . #% We want to see a reduction in the use of pesticides and herbicides . #% The higher the tax , the more the red tape , the greater the incentive not to declare work . #% We need to help the least-developed countries by allowing them access to EU markets , but this needs to be discussed fully not determined by an oral resolution . #% Mr President , I would like to request that the vote on the Dami√£o report on asbestos be added to the voting list today . #% It is one of the most important debates we need to have . #% It seems to me that highest on the agenda is the whole issue of information and education . #% I know the response will be that this is just a technical scheme to exchange information and run seminars for tax officials , but I say it is one more step that takes the European Commission and the European Union closer into the tax affairs of Member States . #% Whilst existing human rights treaties apply to persons with disabilities , they do not specifically state that they protect the rights of persons with disabilities , nor is there an international treaty which specifically addresses those rights . #% I agree with Mr Poettering -- that does not happen often -- that this is not an anti-American project . #% That is why they want us to do the job better and that is why those who are directly implicated in the process -- whether consumers , citizens , or businesses , large and small -- want to feel that they have been consulted and they have had their say at the right stage in the process . #% Since all future battlefield weapons will be navigated by satellite , it is obvious that Europe will be helping China to rearm . #% On the issue of shared information , I think that the information should be shared on a need-to-know basis and , above all , should be kept away from politicians , bureaucrats and even the people who are being protected themselves , because operational security in this area must be paramount . #% Madam President , the proposal before us is to complete the liberalisation of rail freight services , increasing competition in those Member States that have yet to liberalise their markets . #% In a society subject to the rule of law recent events can not be used to close the plant . #% One of the few things we can say about what we have got in front of us is that we have at long last got some sort of parity here with the company statute . #% It seems to me that we have an absolute impasse here . #% My colleague Mr Coelho cited some brilliant examples of negotiations and agreements currently in place . #% It may not be achieved now but I hope that it will be carried over to the Austrian presidency and brought to fruition , because this question of late pay really is the scourge of small businesses throughout the European Union . #% On the contrary , we must all unite to say that this must be the basis on which we move forward . #% Is he confident now that these substances are actually safe for children ? #% There remains only one last piece in the jigsaw of legislation within the EU needed to implement the proper control and use of GMOs , which is the traceability in labelling legislation that we hope to bring before Parliament next month . #% I see Simon Duffin , for example , from our secretariat in Parliament , who was instrumental in bringing about many of the compromises , agreements and consensus in our committee . #% In view of the fact that 35 programmes from 1989 are still on the Commission 's books , nine years after payments were due to finish , it is imperative that suitable measures are introduced now to bring projects in on time and on budget . #% This could not have happened if her anonymity had been preserved . #% Yes , we must look also at the question of the weighting of votes in the Council . #% I was in Washington recently when Justice Roberts was going through his grilling to become the Chief Justice . #% Finally , the question of landmines , which has already been touched on by other speakers . #% That is pretty rich in the very week that the Court of Auditors is refusing to sign off your accounts for the eleventh year in a row . #% However , we are still falling behind competitively . #% I welcome this report from Mr Correia because I know that considerable hard work has gone into it . #% We must end it both within and outside the institutions . #% This directive is crucial , indeed critical , to the financial services action plan . #% Small businessmen can ill afford this cost at a time of economic strife . #% Commissioner , we know you are concerned and we know the Commission is concerned , but the Commission should be judged on what it does . #% Certainly there has been anxiety over illegal logging and certification being difficult to get right in practice , even if it looked good on paper . #% The second point is this : let us not be squeamish ; this decision was taken for domestic political reasons . #% As one who served on the Convention , I know there will be many debates on the future of this continent in the coming years , including through future treaties . #% Let me touch very briefly on one very specific aspect : the issue of anti-personnel landmines . #% To do this would be to pursue kamikaze economics . #% I am not commenting on the justification for these two narratives , but how can it help to cut off , as two British professors have urged , academic and intellectual exchanges ? #% We must get fully behind church leaders and the Save the Assyrians campaign , which I support and which supports me , in the campaign they are taking to northern Iraq later this month . #% The first two sentences of the Laeken Declaration about the debilitating effects of the two World Wars confirm my belief that the European Union is a force for good in the world and Britain , like all other Member States , derives great benefit from the existence of the EU . #% A successful economy is not an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy , but the key to our survival . #% One was the extent to which traceability would be possible . #% However , I say to Mrs Foster and Mr Heaton-Harris that they want to check their stories and sources because it needs both sides in a conflict to be committed if a lasting solution is to be achieved . #% Surely it is the obligation of Ecofin to consider the Commission text and not to allow the interference of central bankers in a text which should of course have been presented to it first for consideration . #% Indeed , the Council of Europe Committee on Torture has not been allowed access to prisoners in Kosovo . #% 
Madam President , regrettably , in the last few years , particularly after the last wave of EU enlargement to the current 25 Member States , Latin America has ceased to be as much in focus politically as it was immediately after , say , the accession of Portugal and Spain in the 1980s and 1990s . #% My support remains for the original recommendations which will guide our future legislation , and ensure Europe plays a constructive role in tackling foot and mouth disease for the future . #% I had hoped this issue would be treated as more important than one subject to cheap political point-scoring . #% Back in the real world , if we measure the real concerns of the public by the frequency with which issues appear in our postbags , I suspect that many Members would admit it is not the EMU or the IGCs but animal welfare , and specifically the transport of animals , which is comfortably ahead . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I should just like to inform the House that not only have we achieved a separate instrument to promote democracy and human rights as a successor to the European initiative , against the original wishes of the Council and Commission , but we have managed to achieve all the objectives set by the European Parliament . #% We also lack the evidence on migration limits , and that has been mentioned . #% Because it is the contracting authorities who publish , this will not affect international competition and , incidentally , the United States already has such a requirement for transparency , with which the EU tenderers have to comply . #% If you have an allergy , it is 100 % for you and we need to be certain that the labelling concerned gives due warning . #% As we come to the end of the European Year of People with Disabilities , we must focus on the needs of MS patients and the research-based opportunities to accelerate the development of more effective treatments . #% That EUR 120 million includes a 5 % annual increase which reflects the operative principle of indexation that takes account of inflation and population growth . #% I strongly urge the House to support the ECON Committee 's compromise because these amendments are essential to remedy or , at any rate , reduce some very serious problems caused by the Commission 's original text . #% Yet they so nearly won through and , had we succeeded , we would not have had to trouble the House on this occasion . #% In other words , the EU must act swiftly and decisively when there are infringements of the social or environmental standards in question . #% Would the Commissioner impress upon the Romanian Government the continuing need to improve the provision of care for orphans ? #% When I was there around a year ago on an ACP-EP mission , there was a great deal of talk from the North and the South , the rebels and the government , about which side was responsible for the failure of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement . #% Can you assure us that the Commission is not considering the withdrawal of the directive on temporary agency workers ? #% The European Union is open to any state which meets the basic criteria . #% Madam President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report . #% Can I say to those who have that idea , be very careful , because I have a suspicion that a toolbox without an optional instrument is potentially actually more invasive of national law than a toolbox with an optional instrument that is voluntary , that respects the autonomy of the parties and is not detrimental to national law . #% Having heard what has been said by my colleagues tonight , I want first of all to say how much I appreciate the kind words about the work I have done in the last three years and how delighted I am with the final outcome : a set of legislation which will provide the toughest laws on GMOs in the world . #% Disability is currently an invisible issue in too many of our development programmes and making disabled people visible will require positive action , risk and experiment . #% Accordingly , if they are part of it , surely they can not be said to undermine it ? #% Consumers are concerned that they are not getting their full rights in terms of availability of products , common prices , or access to justice if they have problems in a cross-border world . #% Second , national planning of programmes could prove counterproductive to addressing regional and local circumstances and involving local stakeholders . #% That means that we need to pursue with vigour the general framework on information and consultation at work . #% Three short simple questions : how in the Commissioner 's analysis do the priorities of the United Nations differ from the priorities of the European Union in terms of the way we believe that humanitarian aid should be delivered ? #% The own-resources system in this age of transparency is completely opaque and no one outside the Committee on Budgets or the Budget Directorate-General understands what it is about and how it is made up . #% We also need to know what the situation is right across the board with Member States . #% The benign scenario of low inflation and low interest rates is a resounding tribute to the countries entering EMU . #% Mr Cornillet was himself a distinguished previous rapporteur . #% However , it becomes difficult to take when we make efforts to uphold the law and in response we are castigated for our inflexibility and dysfunctionality . #% Tunisia 's new political leadership also needs to understand that poor governance and gross inequality offer a fertile breeding ground for violent radicalism . #% However , we were always aware of the problems inherently possible in allowing dialogue . #% Sadly , that has not been the case . #% Since the proposals in the report look likely to increase the administrative burden on the industry ( particularly SMEs ) , as well as dent its competitiveness on a global scale , this is a serious oversight . #% It is not only the demographics that are against the old economies of western Europe , but also the so-called social model . #% I hope that he will be able , with the assistance of DG Tax , to take some serious action to stop the German authorities penalising legitimate trade in this area . #% Then we will have to make cuts in places , which is perhaps not the right way to do it . #% That is probably right but there are still the political elements that we need to consider . #% Unfortunately , it transpires that in that debate Mr Watson , the leader of the Liberal Group , factually misled the House and thereby influenced the House by indicating that the Director-General of the Commission 's internal audit service , Mr Muis , was attending last night 's meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control to discuss this matter and therefore no debate was needed . #% It says that , under inheritance law , a man 's portion must be double that of a woman . #% However , notwithstanding its support overall for the report , with reference to Amendment 1 to Recital 4 , the delegation does not agree that the setting of percentage targets for employment levels is an effective exercise in helping to achieve increased employment rates , but is aware that this amendment is merely a restatement of the European Council 's position . #% I find it very worrying that in certain areas France and Germany seem to prefer the idea of a strategic partnership with countries such as China , rather than the United States . #% Mr Medina Ortega tries to be very clear in his report and I applaud that , but there will always be a wish amongst legislators to use , as it were , alternative regulatory methods other than black letter law . #% To be denied information as to the cause of the delay , with little by way of an apology or compensation , is unacceptable . #% Mr President , I would like to raise the same point . #% It is clearly intended to provide the country with nuclear weapons . #% The fact is that the independent press does not have the print capacity to deal with demand . #% They have had rulings in their courts that no foreign legislation can take precedent over domestic legislation , which legitimizes their protectionist trade regime . #% There were those who wanted 100 % , but we reached 50 % as a good compromise because there are a range of people , particularly in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but also elsewhere in this Parliament , who would like to see the commitment entered into by the Council fulfilled for the way in which we handle the common foreign and security policy between Parliament and Council . #% Mr President , of the many subjects we will be voting on this week I believe that this report and this subject are the most important . #% The Assembly started somewhat tentatively . #% It is not like mobile telephony ; it is not like introducing a GSM standard , because we already have digital television systems in the market , delivering services that consumers want to quite a high interactive standard . #% And so , in order to be able to vote in favour of this Commission , I would need to be able to say that , as a bloc , these are Commissioners whose commitment to introduce exactly such fundamental reforms I can endorse . #% Nevertheless , I believe that at the last meeting of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , with reasonable compromises on both sides , we arrived at a position where a 12-month study could lead -- and I believe will lead -- to a proper assessment of how insurance provision is made . #% It works out at less than EUR 0.1 per person per annum , so it can not be said to be a great deal of money , but it is money that is being spent on real European democracy and we want to ensure that we keep that up and that we see that we do more in future years . #% We also tackled the issues of Members ' expenses and payment of the pensions . #% This is a technical dispute on trade and , although I am a friend of Israel , I support an eventual two-state solution and a dismantling of most of the settlements . #% Unfortunately , that centre has not yet been set up . #% We have worked very closely together , not just on this report , but , as she knows , along with other people , we have both been working on this issue for many years now , for the 10 years since I came into the European Parliament . #% Moreover , it was considered by many Members of this House as at best naive , and at worst arrogant , because it ignored the reality of how our Parliament operates through the political groups . #% Starting this process does not guarantee you will finish it . #% We need someone to guard those people from their own stupidity and errors . #% On the question of third-party access to infrastructure , market entrants need to know that they can access infrastructure on the same terms as those that already exist . #% In fact , Honda can produce overhead valve four-stroke engines that easily meet these requirements . #% It has been a worthwhile exercise in addressing so many of our taxpayers ' concerns about serious allegations of misappropriation of funds , and now we have in place the appropriate mechanisms for scrutiny of the way these monies are being spent . #% 
Parliaments are short on staff and equipment and often lack the basic technical knowledge needed to make their work more effective . #% Not one penny . #% We abstained on two technical points only . #% The Commission has been somewhat guilty in this respect as well , because in consultations , such as on the country strategy papers , they have had written into the agreements the need for negotiations and consultations with civil society . #% Thus a reference to the Council anti-terrorism measures in assessing threats to security is acceptable , but some of those go too far . #% I particularly welcome the proposed change relating to the status of documents emanating from Member States . #% There are 270 000 junior doctors across the EU who will be affected by this . #% I , along with many other colleagues , am concerned about that different approach . #% I would pay very special tribute to the former prime minister , Milo √êjukanoviƒá , and his recent successor , Igor Luk≈°iƒá , who have both been pragmatic and , at the same time , single-minded in their approach and in their quest to lead their country towards EU accession and NATO accession . #% In 2004 we will see a lame-duck Commission on its last legs and the European election cutting across the IGC . #% There is a big question mark concerning these ports of entry and recent experience shows that we have to deal with this issue . #% We always use special pleading about the minutiae as an intellectual fig leaf to avoid the tough decisions . #% I think all of us would agree that those are fine objectives . #% These are just some of the many abuses of which I have personal experience and we know that for the immigration authorities these examples are a daily occurrence . #% Europe 's farmers and Europe 's rural communities deserve to know that they are valued . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating Commissioners Reding , Monti and Diamantopoulou . #% There has been a slide towards relying on evidence extracted under torture and rendition to those countries in breach of the ban on . #% Highly-qualified professional university teachers - not foreign language assistants - are consistently being treated in Italy as unqualified temporary staff and I would ask again that the Council put moral pressure on Italian colleagues to ensure that this disgraceful state of affairs is rectified and that those teachers dismissed for protesting should be reinstated forthwith . #% I believe it is none of these . #% In 2000 Mr Justice Cresswell pointed out that the catalogue of failings and incompetence in the 1980s by underwriters , managing agents , members ' agents , and others was staggering and brought disgrace on one of the City 's great markets . #% We already know the facts , we do not need a post-mortem . #% I am pleased that Mr Lange has withdrawn his suggestion that the small-producer exemption should be set at 10 000 units per year - which would not have covered any European manufacturers - and supported the Commission 's position of 25 000 , which covers 7 manufacturers . #% I welcome the fact that the Zabell report tries to address the problem of intentional doping and proceeds from the presumption of innocence based on the charter of human rights . #% Yet , because of last week 's ill-thought-out measures , Clarks is now being penalised for all three , as European retailers and consumers are now expected to foot the bill for an ailing Italian manufacturing industry . #% The future of the European chemical industry is in building upon the basis that we already have : high-value industry producing high-value products , with a well-trained work force that is well paid and rewarded for its tasks . #% We need to ask the question : why is it that in the case of Botswana , of Asia , of South Africa , we are seeing increases ? #% However , if that company was outside the European Union , every Member State would check thoroughly . #% That said , it is only fair to give notice to the House that we may find ourselves less able to form part of a consensus when the Commission brings forward some of the proposals referred to in paragraph 14 . #% But the real bottom line for Liberals is whether the Member States believe in and respect the notion of European citizenship , not only allowing the citizens of a Member State and their families to move around but also conferring such rights , to the greatest extent possible , on legally resident third-country nationals and their families - which unfortunately were not covered by the Commission report . #% In some cases -- and here I disagree with Mr Cornillet -- it can damage the environment , using scarce resources too much . #% I would call on the Commission to use the European Information Centres to distribute information to ensure that the public and businesses are aware of their responsibilities and the risks involved in not preparing for the year 2000 . #% Therefore , we are prepared to support her oral amendment on this occasion . #% A simplifying treaty could have tackled the real issues : relative economic decline , fraud and waste , and greater involvement of national parliaments in the decision-making processes . #% They deserve the same odium , the same treatment as many of us demanded against apartheid South Africa . #% That means that this Parliament will have at least 732 Members , possibly more . #% My committee was mainly concerned with four areas . #% At last there is meaningful involvement of Parliament and I have no doubt the committees will start to flesh out a final legislative programme . #% I trust that the Council will endorse his offer to inform Parliament in advance of the European Community position to be taken before the institutions of the Energy Community on important issues . #% Given that this is a fiftieth anniversary , we could take this at any part-session , rather than at this particular one . #% Firstly , many of us are disappointed that following the defeat of the Constitution , the opportunity has not been seized to have a wide ranging and open discussion about the nature and direction of the EU in order to take full account of the real wishes of our citizens and make it more relevant to the needs of the 21st century . #% Leaving it just to the wording ` regular ' is not sufficient . #% Cadmium , which is being phased out , and lead have also been mentioned in this context . #% I say that with real feeling and authority because I have been in that position myself . #% We will not be working against the Member States so far as sanctions are concerned ; we will be working with governments . #% This is a species that has a very long life cycle and whose resources , once they have been depleted , will not recover , if at all , for many years . #% author . - Mr President , the ECR Group condemns the appalling treatment being suffered by these innocent and mainly Eritrean victims of what amounts to a modern-day form of slavery inflicted by people traffickers . #% I promise you , there is more . #% We can only hope that recent events will cause the USA to reflect on the need for global partnerships to remove the causes of insecurity . #% It has the morality of a bank raid . #% Our citizens fear that we have lost touch with reality and do not understand their fears , their needs , their lives . #% But she did , I think , neglect to refer to the budget . #% Three issues stand out , and I would like to mention them . #% We talk and talk and we change absolutely nothing when it comes to the Council ' s position . #% Mr President , beyond Chancellor Sch√ºssel 's bonhomie , I think we can sense his frustration at the problem of shepherding 25 fairly feline characters towards agreeing a mandate for a fresh intergovernmental conference . #% Amendment No 74 explains why temporary MRLs are needed . #% I know you do not like this self-help approach : it does not lend itself to EU interference , rules and regulations and the grand handing back of a country 's own money via unelected regional assemblies and development agencies . #% Is it not time for us to activate Article 103 of the Treaty so that we start getting proper economic coordination ? #% My question really is : what is the Commission , rather than Member States , doing , and in particular what are the EU institutions doing , not just to allow people to stay longer but also to employ older people in the first place ? #% Mr Barroso , do you accept that the finances of the European Central Bank and its integrity are now in a serious and parlous state ? #% We only have to look at what happens to those who are thrown out of work or who are excluded from the job market . #% History teaches us that we must never forget . #% However , there are some concerns which the Commission needs to take into account : the environmental impact of extracting oil from tar sands and the health of workers mining asbestos are just two issues which need to be looked at carefully . #% In Brussels , I am very glad to say , the regularity of rain water is not in doubt . #% Indeed , I must congratulate Slovakia , Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia . #% We are now talking about significant changes in the law , long lists of further regulations of substances which may be banned . #% From a marketing and promotional point of view smaller areas and localities could be used , as well as regional breeds such as Aberdeen Angus . #% 
It is a question for you , Mr Commissioner . #% Labour accepts the assessment of health consequence from depleted uranium made by Britain 's Royal Society and supports further research by the World Health Organisation . #% In my view , there is no point in having a Community patent , which could be a very useful development in intellectual property law , if those who use and work with patents find it no help . #% Are you here today giving us the express will of your own nation ? #% This agreement is one of the first free-trade agreements with a developing country and so it sets a number of important precedents . #% Mr President , we need new regulation on labelling and traceability and it must be as rigorous as possible . #% If we do not , then in terms of conflict ` we ai n't seen nothing yet ' . #% The report is based on second-hand information from NGOs and other organisations . #% I have to say , it is absolutely appalling , in any arena of politics , to set expectations which can not be met . #% It is certainly not an undisturbed election if the leaders of the other political parties are under house arrest or in jail . #% During the passage of this report through EMAC the depth of the research into detail that Simon Murphy had carried out was evident to all of us . #% However , I have to say to you that my group deplores the fact that several dossiers at this moment are blocked in Council . #% The Government of Sudan says that this is colonialism . #% It is a question of divergence , not opposition to the Constitution . #% One thing , however , has also become clear in our discussions on the 2011 budget , and that is if we are to fund extra responsibilities in the future because of the Lisbon Treaty , we must also find efficiency savings elsewhere . #% That has been gradually welcomed by the British Medical Association since 1993 and while we must work with the Commission and other agencies to scrutinize future proposals carefully and also consider very carefully remaining genuine reservations , it would be the right and responsible decision of this Parliament tomorrow to lead the way forward for an open-minded approach to tackling some of the very real health needs of citizens throughout Europe . #% By these means , we will ensure that the final product satisfies high standards of quality . #% We may have the technology now , and we must use it because if we do not use it , with the proper safeguards , then the criminal element will be ahead of us in that game , as they have been ahead of us in violence , in their lack of respect for democracy and in actions which are completely abhorrent and unacceptable -- or should be -- to all of us in this House . #% Secondly , it is not at all healthy for the European Union to construct itself as Europe 's interlocutor with the USA on defence and security matters . #% I simply say that it is a practical reality that , without autonomy , it is difficult to exercise responsibility , and when we have autonomy our responsibility must be fully accountable . #% Mr President , I should like to make a point of order under Rule 145 . #% They do a great deal already in Bangladesh , but I wondered if we could know a bit more of what the plans are for the future . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I have been following the trialogues closely and would like to thank my colleagues , especially from the EPP and S&D Groups , for the work they have been doing . #% I apologise in advance to the Commissioner , and I will be much briefer than the chairman of our committee might have been , had he been here . #% Mr President , I rise not only to give my group 's view on this but also my personal welcome to the Commission 's waste management strategy review and to the way in which it has been reinforced and developed by the rapporteur 's amendments . #% It is also necessary to see the elimination of agricultural export subsidies and a new WTO clause to cover the need for food security in developing countries . #% Why should we predefine the issues on which citizens can raise an initiative ? #% The most important point to make about security of supply is the essential requirement of diversity : diversity of fuel , diversity of source and diversity of technology . #% This is very intimidatory , as far as Members are concerned ; it is an intrusion on our parliamentary premises . #% Dr Jaramillo was then shot in the head and killed . #% Mr President , we are all opposed to discrimination and violence of all forms . #% There are many in this House who do not believe any of those countries to be safe . #% The Convention wrestled with the age-old problem of whether we want equality of states or equality of citizens . #% It is important to have a date when this facility will be available to us . #% I am particularly concerned about the fact that we are not thinking about the way the market is going to reconstruct . #% I welcome the developing framework in the area of health where it is certainly going to encourage the development of steady progress in that field . #% We have yet to grant discharge to this committee for the 2001 set of accounts and , as more revelations appear about the state of its accounts and what has been going on within that committee , it is highly unlikely that we will do so . #% The report that eventually came out of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was indeed a reasonable report . #% That is happening and the fact that people are slightly dissatisfied about the amount of time they have is merely symptomatic of how successful the whole process is . #% I represent the Isle of Wight , off the south coast of England , undoubtedly a border region , and it has a GDP of 64 % of the European average . #% The issue of subsidiarity was raised in committee and indeed is raised again in plenary through a number of amendments . #% Britain and Germany employ more than double the staff numbers , pound for pound , mark for mark , in managing their aid programmes . #% This debate does not impose any legal requirements upon Member States but if the messages we send out today are heard strongly across Europe , they will have serious implications for vital areas of medical research in the future . #% So my group - and I believe all the groups - have agreed to amendments that will reflect today 's progress . #% We have succeeded in this industry in the past and we can continue to do so in the future . #% However , we requested a number of separate votes in this motion where the text refers to ` European integration ' , a term associated with political integration . #% Overall , the Socialist Group takes the view that an opt-out from a health and safety directive is a dangerous nonsense . #% I urge Members to support this report . #% Secondly , I understand that it has now gone to the Member States for consultation . #% Their current home insurer is not allowed to provide that cover . #% Japan is stockpiling en masse . #% The Council must adopt the proposed directive urgently so that the Commission can ensure that it is implemented effectively and without delay . #% In that vein , can I ask the Commissioner to at least consider , perhaps by means of a study or a survey , giving support for re-defining the definition and including other languages perhaps non-European in origin , but still spoken and understood by many people , languages understood across many EU states - Urdu , Hindi , Bengali and Tamil , to name but a few . #% The report emphasises three horizontal issues of great importance to the success of the strategy . #% The Commission can not accept Amendment No 10 . #% It gives a clear signal to Saddam Hussein that Europe is united in its condemnation of Iraq 's failure to comply with UN Security Council resolutions . #% It is appropriate that we are debating this now , on the day that we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Mr Wei Jingsheng . #% For that reason , we should vote against these amendments and support what is , I agree , a flawed and partial compromise , but , nevertheless , one which makes some progress . #% I therefore say to Members of the House that they should look at the title of this report . #% I urge the presidency not to be distracted by the siren calls of those who urge that the preservation of the ` European model ' is the most important political priority . #% These proposals form part of a concerted attack by the Commission on the road haulage industry . #% In many cases the research is already there . #% Foreign investment must provide funds for education and rural health . #% We learned a great deal from that visit , not least that the applicant countries will make a tremendous contribution to the cultural life and vitality of Europe . #% Another role of the veterinary inspectors is to monitor the export of trade of live cattle to third countries under the export refund scheme . #% The Commission has also proposed to bring the private sector within the scope of Directive 93/38/EEC : effectively in line with the GPA even though the private sector is excluded from the GPA . #% 
We know that Parliament has not actually approved the Afghanistan funding of EUR 1 billion and yet we see the Commission and the Council gaily going ahead , assuming that this will be the case . #% We must not conjure up new projects with ever increasing budgets . #% We have a persistent and clear need to continue to work towards greening the budget in all areas of policy activity and I want to see further work on this this year . #% Some may take the view that individuals take a chance and there is a risk , but if we are looking at questions of human dignity , and where this fits in the overall goals of a common immigration policy , this is a serious issue . #% I was a lone voice in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the date of the vote , supporting the amendments of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection and very similar ones of my own , calling for the phasing out of subsidies for all tobacco . #% The Tindemans report has laid down the parameters for debate although I and my group - and especially the Labour Group of MEPs - still await a report on security policy more in tune with Europe 's aspirations for peace and security in the next millennium . #% Pigs were fed improperly treated swill , which was bad farming practice . #% After all , we in Europe recognize only too well that activity one side of the world can have profound effects elsewhere , including Europe . #% When did the information departments of the Commission or Parliament last attend a meeting of that committee ? #% He has been there for three weeks . #% Structural funding must bring added value and be a genuine European policy in its own right , helping less prosperous regions rather than Member States , developing transnational linkages and helping ensure that all can benefit from the European single market . #% The Council then rejected it , albeit with a two-year phase-out period . #% One of the most important features of the Commission 's action plan is that it is essentially a two-step process . #% Trends and patterns of work tell us that the terrain of that work is changing and we need to adapt new strategies , new techniques and new practices to take account of and anticipate the effects of this change . #% I speak as the President of the Forum for Construction in the European Parliament . #% And finally , in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors , the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change , the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance . #% The work programme should be an exciting indication of where the European Union is going and of what the European Union intends to do . #% Six phthalates are identified , and a system of warnings proposed that makes no sense . #% In Bangladesh , the government recently announced that it would increase the number of authorised overtime hours and reduce the restrictions on women 's night work . #% That may help to break the logjam we are facing there . #% In amending its Rules of Procedure today , Parliament is giving a powerful signal that it is ready to assist in this process and to do so with due speed and diligence . #% If ever there was a classic case of cutting off your nose to spite your face , it is that of those people advocating 150 grammes . #% The easy bit is to achieve this , using low-sulphur crude or blending . #% So what happens to family life , despite the claims to humanitarian protection ? #% Mr President , often in this House , we adopt many resolutions and we say many fine words . #% Yet just four and a half years later I was deeply disappointed to see that the modest reference to the social economy under the enterprise pillar of the old employment guidelines had completely disappeared under the heading ` fostering enterprise and promoting job creation ' in the new , streamlined employment guidelines . #% I also wish to thank colleagues here tonight from the various committees involved . #% Although I went to the summit , I was entirely unaware of his interest , so maybe we could get together later . #% Thus our overwhelming priority should be to re-engage the disenchanted voter : a reformed European Commission , a reformed European Parliament , interacting in a robust but mature manner , is the only way in which we have any real hope of doing so . #% I find it regrettable that you , Sir , as our President , think otherwise . #% This is actively discouraging legitimate business and will simply be handing this business to fraudulent traders . #% Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ spoke earlier about the situation on the southern border of Spain . #% Mr President , on 29 November the Committee on Culture and Education will hold a hearing of experts on this matter , after which Parliament will want to bring forward specific proposals . #% For most people in society violence against women is abhorrent , but we know it exists . #% The opinion of those within the educational system is often lost within the large civil service machines and bureaucracies which run schools . #% In my opinion , the Commission 's proposals on promoting the use of biofuels for transport are not necessarily the best way of achieving those objectives . #% They too are often strange , uncomfortable and schizophrenic , but they remain the best we have all the same . #% That is rather a shame . #% Without that , and without the opening of national infrastructure , European rail freight is doomed . #% The UK takes very seriously all allegations of violence and racism by public servants . #% The committee has achieved certain compromises which , I believe , will effectively win a proper vote in plenary this week . #% You may know that I do not wish my country to be part of the EU , but currently it is and I am a democrat . #% Full labelling will therefore work to British beef farmers ' advantage . #% When are we going have realistic and sensible measures and the sort of technical committee structure that this Parliament asked you to introduce at first reading in 1997 and which is simply dismissed here ? #% Can you , Commissioner , guarantee the safety of children in my constituency ? #% I welcome what he said about different marks , but we need to give serious consideration to the cost of regulatory compliance . #% Mr Cunha , you know I believe that part of the proposal is mad . #% Unfortunately , once drug companies - even with the best intention to alleviate suffering - allowed their products and intellectual property rights to be semi-confiscated under the guise of becoming available on affordable terms in developing countries , it was inevitable that all sorts of complications would arise . #% I say no to the release of GMOs resistant to antibiotics . #% There is also the need to look at the policy of sealing the floodwater drains against terrorist activities , which in this case has clearly exacerbated the situation . #% We support the establishment of such an agency to regenerate local economies . #% We are also fooling ourselves if we think that what is on the table here is actually going to meet the needs of each and every migrant worker within the European Union . #% Commissioner Bonino made a commitment to come forward with a communication on financial services and , if necessary , a directive . #% This is a time for thanksgiving that we are able to sit alongside democratically elected representatives of those previously suppressed peoples . #% Mrs Echerer gave us a hint of that just now . #% Uganda is yet again in the news for the extremism and hysteria of some of its legislators . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I would like to move an oral amendment which would become paragraph 7a ( new ) . #% This requires very delicate judgment . #% The principles , however , are ones on which we are all agreed . #% Finally , on the question of recreational waters : I think that all the recreational water amendments are rather silly , because the definition is too wide to be meaningful . #% Further , as to conflict resolution procedures based as they are on a WTO model , we have already experienced the banana war where innocent British companies have been penalised for matters which have nothing to do with them and over which they have no control whatsoever . #% We will be doing ourselves no good by regretting that the Council did not approve something which we did not even propose . #% So there is enlightened self-interest for Turkey to move on this issue . #% I am not in any way opposed to further harmonisation , it can be helpful to the good functioning of the internal market , but imposed legislative harmonisation needs to be carefully and openly considered , or we may find we have left our citizens behind in this project . #% If it is fundamentally the case that , despite past animosity , there is now the will for peace on both sides , could the Commission and Council not play a more active role in bringing the two sides together ? #% I want to raise the issues of economic and monetary union and economic coordination . #% 
But in order to do that , in order to discuss the options it is essential for the Commission to go there with the threat of impending sanctions against the regime . #% The report is very defensive in tone . #% It will be important over time to rationalise and if possible to expand our assistance to the Balkans . #% We need to have a market-led solution so that we do not find we are collecting things just for the sake of it . #% Firstly , we need to ensure that we consolidate our friendships with those allies with whom we wish to act together against American unilateralism . #% We must and we will . #% Yet we still persist in allowing accidents to happen in the workplace . #% The completion of the internal market should be a priority and the initial steps taken by the Commission to withdraw unnecessary regulation are welcomed . #% Secondly , if EU citizens are to know about the EU they require information . #% What is needed now is a bold , generous , urgent international initiative with the European countries , the United States , Russia and well-meaning Arab states , speaking with one voice . #% We need a multi-pronged policy , we need to act together to stop the growers and the traders and the pushers , but we also need policies on education and health and we need to encourage research . #% These are the companies consisting of between roughly 5 and 15 employees . #% Flexibility , not rigidity , is required . #% I wish to raise two concerns of my own . #% I am particularly grateful , in respect of the UK , for the clarified exemption for charity shops and street markets from the obligation to provide information on origin , which would have been beyond them . #% In short , it is an abuse of the opportunities offered by our Parliament to debate and determine issues like this which are vital and important and deserve better than this approach . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to say that we welcome this report . #% It is right that we should be leading in this field . #% We are accepting a transitional solution , but the controversy has been quite successful in exposing the problems concerning Parliament 's composition and electoral procedure . #% We do not want confrontation between our two bodies but at the end of the day we want to make sure that development , other sections of Category 4 and external expenditure are not disadvantaged . #% Mr Blair said recently that you need powerful reasons to turn round and say ` no ' to the police . #% My group believes that we should be building on the Geneva Convention and that hopefully a common asylum policy will eventually do that . #% However , the report consistently and unaccountably refers to the EU as if it were a sovereign state - references that I and other Members attempted unsuccessfully to remove at the committee stage . #% We also heard that there were strong arguments against creating what many considered to be an inflation of Parliamentary posts . #% I call on the Council presidency and the Commission to take urgent action , to visit Aung San Suu Kyi , to bring about her immediate release and , in case the SPDC does not respond in a positive way , to draw up new measures that can quickly be taken against the Burmese regime . #% While the Council regularly denounces the barbaric theocratic regime in Tehran , individual Member States have sometimes taken a less robust approach . #% It is worth noting , on the obligation to make checks at banks and bureaux de change , that she encourages close cooperation between Member States , the European Central Bank , national central banks , Europol and , when established , Eurojust . #% The European Commission 's regular report marks a critically important step for Romania , and , I would guess , for Bulgaria as well . #% May I ask him to confirm that the Commission 's choice not to participate in certain meetings will be taken , as he put it , on a ` meeting by meeting ' basis , not a structure by structure basis , depending on what is being discussed . #% Mr President , I am very pleased to be able to speak on this issue , which I think everyone agrees is of major public concern . #% But we have major concerns about the role and activity of the continuing interim government and the state of emergency . #% Mr President , I must apologise for this appearing to be a British show at this moment . #% The pity is that we are terrible managers . #% I thank the Commissioner particularly for shifting its focus and taking forward our proposals for a multi-stakeholder forum and for a greater commitment to the international dimension and the international impact of European businesses worldwide . #% Iran 's intransigence and refusal of the reasonable Russian offer on enrichment of uranium has been a wake-up call to Russia and China . #% I am sorry the committee has not accepted some of the amendments I tabled at an earlier stage . #% Although I have no doubt that the ECB will face many difficult challenges in the years ahead , I am pleased to report that so far it has risen to the challenges it has faced with considerable √©lan . #% The first is to thank Mr Duisenberg again for his assurance to this House that the process of cooperation between the ECB and the national central banks is now adequate , even in the case of a serious crisis in which a euro area financial institution may need to be supported . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , this was the worst natural disaster ever to hit Pakistan . #% Mr President , it seems to me that the outcome is a vindication of the Community method . #% If access is refused to the citizen , the citizen must be given the reason for refusal and there is recourse to the Ombudsman and the Court of Justice . #% It is all very well for this report to question the City of Strasbourg 's ` good faith ' , but the reality is that this city worked out the best deal it could get for itself . #% Here we come to the crux of the matter : the argument that somehow these people are outside US national jurisdiction . #% It is high-profile work in those countries , and almost without exception it is money well spent . #% We now have to adjourn the continuation of this debate until 9.30 p.m. #% This is a very good example of the eco-system approach to fisheries : taking action for environmental reasons beyond those applying strictly for fish stock levels . #% When we dealt with the noise directive we were told that we must exclude music and entertainment because what we were trying to do was to force members of orchestras to wear Mickey Mouse ear protectors and that we were about to ban the use of the bagpipes in Scotland . #% I should like to salute the three Graces of this report : Mrs Fontaine , the Minister - Mrs Jacobs - and the rapporteur . #% This means that there has to be some restructuring of these industries across Europe . #% Madam President , I know you , like me , will share the concern that this week offers no opportunity to express our interest at what is occurring in Burma and , in particular , the sacrifice and suffering of Aung San Suu Kyi who is our Sakharov Prize winner . #% There is a challenge in realising the full potential of the e-economy . #% My group will not be supporting those amendments . #% It is by far the most positive statement we have heard about Kosovo in the last few months and it is a clear indication that many months of very patient diplomacy are beginning to pay off . #% It has not established evidence , it has merely provided a platform for anti-American bias . #% From Parliament , we can send a clear signal of our intent by endorsing Romania 's chosen target date of 1 January 2007 . #% However , there are downsides , which all of us here would acknowledge . #% I will stand up during the vote to ask Parliament to support an oral amendment to ensure that both these reports fall into in line with the Financial Regulation . #% The notion that the Constitution was essential for an enlarged Union is clearly a myth . #% Furthermore , it looked forward with relish to the creation of various forms of political and economic world governance . #% I want to make a comment to those Member States which criticised the Stability Pact for being too rigid . #% We face in the region a degree of potential instability now , with the rise of demi-gods such as Presidents Morales and Chavez in Bolivia and Venezuela respectively , who cosy up to the Castro Communist dictatorship of Cuba and reject Western concepts of freedom and democracy . #% Mr President , I should like to warmly welcome this report by Mrs Carlotti and congratulate her on her very thorough and far-reaching work . #% We now know that sovereign immunity no longer applies for war crimes , but the group has also pointed out that Taylor has breached the terms of his asylum by interfering in Liberian politics ahead of the elections scheduled there for October and by financing parties sympathetic to him with money he obtained corruptly through the diamond trade when in power as President . #% Khin Nyunt , the current Prime Minister , played a central role in ensuring I did not have the opportunity to deliver that letter in person . #% The EU is the biggest trading block in the world and it is about time we stopped rolling over in the face of the WTO and of the United States . #% It can thus thwart reforms without a two-thirds majority in the Lower House . #% 
I hope that has come across quite clearly . #% Even today , 49 % of the population in LDCs still live on less than a dollar a day . #% I am very pleased that the British Government , as reported on 13 November in the Guardian , has said that Ministers have decided the way forward is to include labour standards and environmental concerns from the outset . #% With your permission I would like to re-raise the point of order that I tried to make just before the votes this morning . #% I extend my thanks to those Members from the states concerned who have also voted for this resolution . #% Any student who wants to understand conciliation procedure or codecision procedure has a nice straightforward case study here . #% Secondly , while I offered a guarded welcome to back liberalisation , I share some of Mr Markov 's concerns as to the social impact on small farmers and businesses as preferential lending will end . #% The document will include recommendations for improving administrative procedures and for making relevant amendments to the Staff Regulations . #% The head of the British delegation , Sir Con O'Neil , remarked that these two events were not unconnected . #% Perhaps not least , we should not stigmatise failure but rather use it as a step to success . #% The European Training Foundation must prepare adequately for covering MEDA countries . #% Europeans are rightly alarmed at the unilateralist policies of the US administration , its readiness to contemplate pre-emptive strikes and its refusal to internationalise the occupation of Iraq . #% I welcome the fact that we are able to have a debate on the fundamental rights within the European Union . #% Can you clarify the position with regard to Council Question Time this week and say what Members with genuine questions for the Council should do ? #% In this case the science was less than adequate . #% But the Union will also be freed up to act more effectively on the domestic and external challenges we face . #% Lastly , my group would like me to say that we want to see this reform process completed and we need to look at how this whole process is being conducted . #% Is this not an expensive method which also has security implications ? #% Where we need this measure , it is important that our directive is based on science . #% I will therefore vote for you . #% It has bowdlerised their reports , it has pressured them into changing their positions . #% Perhaps that is why we disagree with some of the other speakers in this debate . #% For this reason , British Conservatives abstained overall in the final vote on the report . #% The UK Ombudsman has had substantial access to many UK actors in this drama . #% It seems to us that this was the underlying motive behind Mr Patten 's proposal for the rapid reaction facility . #% European legislation should not be adding to the uncertainty that people feel about their retirement . #% I think it is the best that we could achieve , and a culmination of many years of work and attempts by Parliament to get this problem resolved . #% In doing so I was n't voting against helping Pakistan , but I was recognising the report before us simply would n't deliver what Pakistan needs . #% Thirty-five thousand wind turbines the size of jumbo jets , the biggest desecration of my beautiful island since the Industrial Revolution . #% . There is much to commend in this resolution , especially in terms of sustainable development . #% The whole experience has been a real lesson in the handling of the transitional requirement that arises automatically when we are making very necessary but quite sudden changes in our management and financing relationships . #% This is completely unacceptable since , as well as being extremely cruel , animal testing is crude and inefficient . #% They must be protected from the risk of financial loss , and the proposals here should allow individual Member States to take significant steps to prevent cross-contamination - at least that is the hope . #% It is of course true that the European Union is not a supermarket , but equally it is not a temple in which people who speak a little too loudly are asked to remain quiet . #% Quite rightly concern about this crosses national boundaries and the ideological divide . #% It is nothing to do with us . #% For us the choice is to come or not ; for the staff who work here the choice is somewhat different . #% Mr President , the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all . #% Consequently , our national legislation has been particularly strict and strong with regard to mining waste . #% The word ` transportation ' is an American word ; the English word is ` transport ' . #% These are European oil companies . #% As India 's largest trading partner and principal source of foreign investment , the EU is poised to help India reap the benefits of liberalisation . #% You said that you wanted there to be a credible policy for Ireland with their second referendum , and so you produced these guarantees , and here they are - guarantees on the right to life , on taxation , on security and defence . #% I think that is the route the Council should pursue in dialogue with us . #% These are clearly very critical issues for us to discuss . #% More than that , by subsidizing them we are encouraging a worldwide problem of overproduction and overcapacity in international fisheries which , of its own right and economically necessarily so , causes excess depletion of stocks on a global basis . #% Sometimes we discover a real area that needs legislation and yet we are powerless to act . #% The Commissioner stresses that in the EU of 15 , 48 regions - accounting for 18 % of the population - had a per capita income below 75 % of the average , whereas in an enlarged Union a total of 67 regions will fall below the 75 % threshold - representing 26 % of total population . #% Even the United States now recognises this , although they have yet to come up with an alternative in any practical form to the Kyoto Protocol . #% Two or three weeks ago there was a Conference in Stockholm of the chairmen of the defence committees of the fifteen national parliaments and the European Parliament to debate exactly this question - how to exercise democratic control over European policies and foreign affairs and defence . #% There are limitations , but we are there , working behind the Cotonou Partnership Agreement with parliamentarians in a unique way . #% Can I also have assurances that the trade unions have not been pressurised ? #% In large part I can say ` yes ' , but not entirely . #% She spoke of the damning indictment on safety checks . #% It is setting them goals , it is identifying the need for training for development , for promotion and identifying the things that they need to do to contribute to the development of themselves and to the organisation overall . #% This obligation can entail lowering interest rates across ` Euroland ' to stimulate growth . #% People of a different religion should not be discriminated against . #% The final point , going back to a point that Mrs Jackson made to begin with , is that we must ensure , when labelling comes in , that equal rules are applied with certainty across the EU . #% While we have to take security precautions , I hope that we would not allow barriers to be created between us and the electorate , because that is exactly what the perpetrators want : to undermine democratic society . #% This is probably because the agreements reached make such common sense and are of such obvious benefit to ordinary Britons that not even the extremist Europhobic Tories could find anything to complain and make a fuss about . #% Steps should be taken immediately to freeze their overseas assets and to impose a travel ban . #% It was suggested that a closed season for sand eel fishing should be introduced between April and August when the breeding birds were most dependent on sand eels for food . #% Madam President , I just wanted to bring to your attention the arrest in Greece a week ago of twelve British subjects and two Dutch subjects . #% But , judging by this weekend 's newspaper revelations that the EU has a surplus of four billion bottles of wine , costing the taxpayers a billion a year , not much has been learnt in that area . #% For the record , comments were properly made to me pointing out that there is insufficient NGO involvement in agenda preparation and presentation in the Commission 's twice-yearly meetings with Brussels-based development NGOs . #% We also have to look at some of the challenges created by Amsterdam . #% 
Lastly , I entirely agree with Mr Verhofstadt : I commend you in all your efforts to stabilise the Middle East and North African countries and , in particular , your condemnation of the killing of Christians in Egypt , but why , as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out , has President Assad of Syria been left off the EU sanctions list after the brutal killing of innocent civilian protesters by his forces in recent days ? #% But a 10 % across the board cut is not the way to do it . #% Another way would be for the Council to put it in the accession treaty but again if they were to do that unilaterally , without consensus and agreement , that would undermine the spirit of the Treaties . #% We note the letter of 23 October from the Iranian ambassador to the EU , assuring us that there have been no cases of stoning in recent months and that directives have been issued by the competent authorities for the cessation of this process and are being observed . #% I would like to ask all the political forces represented in this Parliament to campaign for a positive vote in the referendum . #% It recognises the problem , which is that the economies of Europe need to be more competitive and that Europe is rapidly losing its competitive position , but then sets about devising measures that are either irrelevant or will actually make the problem worse . #% This directive was introduced under single-market legislation and it is self-evident that if those craft are not intended to be placed on the market , then they can not affect the single market . #% To that extent , it might be thought desirable , even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity . #% The very paragraph , of course , that is opposed by majorities within the big groups in this House . #% What is left is still very useful , very positive , but it is a pale shadow of the excellent and very thorough work that she had put in . #% Mr President , I want to raise the issue of various moves in some Member States , notably France , to ban the wearing of so-called overt religious symbols . #% On our side of the political divide , we recognised at an early stage how sensitive this issue could be and indeed our experience of Agenda 2000 was the catalyst that told us this . #% There needs to be a much more honest debate secondly - nationally and at the European level - about the real possibility of achieving the environmental objectives set out in draft legislation . #% When we sign up to laws , we have to implement them properly . #% We will only vote ` yes ' if we are clear that a proper deal has been done . #% Yet this year we had to produce Parliament 's own-initiative report on the EEJ-Net , a European alternative dispute network set up by the Commission using a co-regulatory approach . #% Furthermore , those who receive that information are to be sworn to secrecy and can be disciplined for breaches of confidence . #% I recommend that a proper study of the effects of the new regime should be made without delay . #% The sarcophagus of the Chernobyl 4 nuclear reactor could be much better and more effective . #% I hope now that the myriad problems created by the various Spanish authorities will be addressed and that such will be promptly resolved in the best interests of my constituents . #% Consolidation can not be achieved through tax rises alone . #% The Commission is in listening mode . #% It was particularly ironic that the UK Minister for Europe should have come to Strasbourg last autumn - to plead with UK MEPs from all parties to vote down the whole Ghilardotti report - to find that not only were Labour MEPs positively promoting the report but the UK representative then bent over backwards to support it as well . #% I thank the Commissioner for his kind words and the personal support that he gave me in what he acknowledged was a quite difficult task in Cambodia . #% We were told by the Council that the Commission is preparing social and economic assistance for a newly independent East Timor , all of which of course we welcome . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , the ALDE Group welcomes the fisheries partnership agreement with Greenland . #% It is absolutely crucial that having set out the broad principles of a European food law and a food safety authority to act as the overall scrutineer of such proposals , the details are dealt with effectively and accurately . #% Briefly , he helped deliver a boat to Morocco ; several months later people using the boat were arrested for drug smuggling . #% We want to see the detailed work that is being conducted on monetary union followed up with detailed work dealing with social exclusion and dealing with unemployment . #% Likewise , simplifying the Treaties would serve the public interest , but this must not be the pretext for introducing a fully-fledged European constitution , especially if the latter were the founding document of a federal state whose preamble was a legally-binding charter of rights . #% It is no good to say that banks will pick up all the frauds . #% As a quid pro quo of setting up a company under the European company statute model , there must be an element of worker involvement . #% Poverty is the real threat here . #% We still have the problem of 850 unfilled vacancies within the Commission . #% In particular , the Montenegrin Government needs to address the seven key priorities identified by Commissioner F√ºle in the Commission 's opinion . #% The Hautala report , at first reading , called for reductions to 1.5 % in sensitive areas like the English Channel , the Baltic and the North Sea . #% We can not be responsible for the Theo Waigels of the world who would declare 3 % to be 3.000 % and get hoist by their own petard when their deficit is forecast to overshoot by 0.2 % . #% I hope you , Mr President , and colleagues here in this Parliament will support all measures to get justice and real help for the victims . #% My last point reiterates one of the main aims of this proposal : that of reducing bottlenecks . #% I would like to give a few ideas of how one might see the future . #% In 1996 the European Court of Justice ruled that this is a health and safety directive and that health and safety is about the total social , psychological and physical wellbeing of individuals . #% We need tariff-free access for least-developed countries , not only for virtually all products - that is a phrase that leaves a giant loophole for the EU to continue protecting its own agriculture - but for all products from those countries . #% It makes law , it produces law , in over 3 000 committees whose constitution nobody ever knows and has not been declared . #% This proposal puts animal welfare above human vanity , but never above human health . #% In the 21st century , I am afraid it is a symbol of waste and inefficiency . #% Yet we can not attempt to change the way the Americans deal with their own national legislation and legal system . #% You also , in your introduction , made a point about people who feel marginal . #% We should have placed greater emphasis on the introduction of rail regulators , as the UK now has , and less on the ideology of physical separation of infrastructure and operating services . #% Therefore , it must realise that further consequences will follow . #% It is long overdue . #% It has consolidated Serb opinion behind Milosevic and weakened the opposition . #% We are aware of growing problems of ozone across Europe , but if we are not even prepared to match the standards being set by the USA , one of our great commercial rivals , this would indeed be a great shame and a sorry reflection on our commitment to environmental improvement . #% Indeed , in his annual EMI report , the President berates the EU and its agents for failing to create the conditions for jobs to be manufactured . #% However , as previous speakers have pointed out , these profits should be made within a basic ethical and regulatory framework to ensure that new biotechnological products are beneficial , rather than harmful , to the health of human beings and other living creatures , and also to the wider environment . #% The fifth wave , which enlarged the Union to 25 Member States in 2004 , has actually been a great success , in spite of many dire warnings that the Union would be paralysed without a Constitution and that countries such as mine would suffer unsustainable immigration flows , including from the Roma population . #% But we will certainly do as you say . #% The two latest much-lauded success stories are India and China , neither of which has followed their prescriptions . #% And here we go again ! #% Half of the governments accused of failing to apply EU law have not replied to Mr Monti 's letters six months after they were despatched . #% I did wonder some months ago whether to table amendments , which would suggest a less ambitious outcome , but which would perhaps be more acceptable to Member States . #% We should stop talking about the problems of enlargement and remind people that enlargement is a solution to many of those problems . #% In that context the Commission proposal is wholly justified and the improvements put forward by Mr Trakatellis represent an excellent contribution worthy of complete support . #% But they present exactly the same problems as tailings dams resulting from mining operations . #% Just to go back for a moment , the quotas were introduced because there had been a huge increase in the production of potatoes for starch when starch from potatoes started to be treated , as far as subsidies were concerned , in the same way as cereals . #% As a Geordie to a Yorkshire man , I have to say , ` Th ` as done good , lad ' . #% In many areas simple , civilisational assets such as running water and sewage disposal systems are missing . #% 
I hope that when reality -- rather than mythology -- rears it head after 1 May , Member States can start to ease these restrictions . #% Removing these women from assistance aimed at helping these most vulnerable people is as illogical as it is inhuman . #% In the name of my group , I urge you to do all you can to put people , and not least , the most vulnerable people , at the heart of the European project . #% We have to realise that if you have a Member State that suffers from a fall in its real GDP of 1 % in a given year , going inevitably hand-in-hand with increasing unemployment , raising unemployment benefit expenditure and falling tax revenues , in such a difficult situation any country would witness a rapidly deteriorating budget deficit of several percentage points likely to push it over the 3 % deficit ceiling , thus making it excessive . #% We believe that customers have the right to be fully informed . #% We propose that the pay and pension system continues to be based on the fixed relationship with pay movements in the civil administrations of Member States . #% I would not like people to look at the masses of space in the public areas and then come and see our little cramped offices , out of which we lose a third for a useless bathroom - but that is another matter . #% Mr President , I speak as shadow rapporteur on behalf of my group . #% I want to say something , however , coming from the Member State which first suffered the full rigours of BSE and which has also , as a result of that , been in the vanguard of cleaning up this problem . #% The Resolution seeks to give such a body power over Member States ' territories , which is an inappropriate response to the cooperation between nations the Report called for . #% Minimum standards should be adhered to and agreements suspended where there is clear evidence of widespread human rights abuses . #% The question is , who would these fool ? #% Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mr Menrad ; he has produced a very balanced report . #% We can not say what the exact state of affairs is at the moment as there is a complete media blackout in force as part of a set of new restrictive laws introduced in May . #% Does he see any change taking place in the near future ? #% Why is this totally insufficient ? #% I note that the Greens have proposed an amendment drawing attention to the opinion of the European Parliament that there should be some form of European Union environmental inspectorate . #% - In the weeks leading up to the agreement of this resolution , many MEPs have sought to ensure Europe 's stance is one which genuinely makes this a `` Development Round '' in the WTO , that developing countries are enabled to be full partners in the negotiating process , and to underline that the benefits of trade must be focused to combat increasing poverty in our world . #% I rise because a damaging accusation was made that somehow we have violated the treaties by excluding smaller groups from discussions and negotiations and it is extremely important to correct this . #% It may succeed - and I hope that it does - and it may not . #% The nine-year timetable , of course , is an improvement on what the Council of Ministers wanted . #% Mrs Wallstr√∂m will agree with me that we must work hard to convince the public that we can get it right on chemicals and on pollution issues , eco-labelling and all those other things which would make sense to the public . #% Mr Putin would feel perfectly at home . #% Some # 300 billion is traded every day in the City of London . #% Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements . #% However , many Europeans do hold traditional views with regard to homosexuality , often based on religious conviction . #% The significance of this development was displayed last week by the first public talks between the Foreign Ministers of Israel and Pakistan . #% Mr President , I join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Alyssandrakis on his report on the Commission communication to the Council and Parliament on Europe and Space : Turning to a new chapter . #% It was very encouraging when we had the British minister responsible for animal welfare , Mr Elliot Morley , here last month at the Intergroup for Animal Welfare and heard the positive view he expressed on the initiatives that will be taken under the British Presidency . #% I still have a number of concerns about the directive . #% Mr President , my group 's attitude towards the Commission 's attempts in this area is rather different from that of the previous speaker . #% We have to ensure that the single market applies to defence industries as far as possible , and that Article 296 only applies in those areas specified in the Treaty . #% Consequently , it is also important that we include self-employed workers . #% In the Minutes under paragraph 39 on the revision of the treaties I am listed as voting for that particular paragraph . #% However , to have rejected the report would have placed in jeopardy the positive points ; hence my support , although with the reservations I have expressed clearly here . #% I am particularly concerned about the lack of commitment shown with regard to the trans-European networks and particularly with regard to funding of the taskforces for research and development into many key strategic industrial areas that will affect the competitivity , the success and prosperity of the European Union into the next century . #% Five or six years ago , the response would have been : `` Yes , but we do not want too much interference '' . #% This is an important plank in judicial cooperation and a major subject of human interest . #% Why ca n't the UK do the same I thought . #% This is not an easy situation . #% I take exception to some of the comments both on my own side and from the Greens with regard to this issue . #% I am delighted at the ban on bullbars , not only when cars are sold , but also an as after-sales purchase . #% before the final vote #% We are not very familiar with this concept in the English language . #% in writing . - I am interested to see that more countries , the latest now being Cyprus and Malta , are choosing the join the euro , which makes Britain 's position look increasingly conspicuous . #% My colleague Mrs Marinucci will be commenting in greater detail on the specific provisions of the report . #% I would also like to thank Mr Juncker for his verdict on the French and Dutch ` no ' votes . #% A lack of democracy pervaded the talks , as they took place behind the closed doors of ` green rooms ' , and the opportunity to lift millions out of poverty simply did not materialise . #% The challenge is how we act upon that . #% Whilst we have been dealing with this immediate crisis , other countries around the world - some with political values that seem very different to our own - have been forging ahead . #% But it does seem somewhat ironic to me that we have been voting in this place all week to save the planet but we still ride around Strasbourg in our chauffeur-driven Mercedes . #% I am aware of what a terrible minefield this proposal is going to be . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Carlotti on her speech . #% The necessary measure to combat these diseases would lead to an overall lifting of the quality of life for some of the world 's poorest people . #% In our discussions on this action programme , Parliament has insisted on the need for civil society to be involved in the programme itself and its evaluation . #% There have been most serious handicaps for European Union telecommunications operators and a most serious and disadvantageous distortion of competition . #% The British , of course , have not been given the chance to have their say , thanks to the deceit of the only three parties with access to television debate in my country , aided and abetted by an EU-corrupted public-service broadcaster known as the BBC . #% If we can not win that then we must look at reform of GATT to ensure that trade , important though it is , does not take precedence over every other consideration such as animal welfare , protection of the environment and the wellbeing of our peoples . #% In the case of Africa , it means that some aspects of the deal may be slightly less bad . #% This report by Mr Corbett and Mr M√©ndez de Vigo gets the story right and I am pleased to say that all Members of my Group who will be speaking today will be speaking in favour of this resolution . #% Frankly , that is where this report is still inadequate . #% In practice , the course of action and rigorous scrutiny which I requested to be applied in the case of Mr Cahn meant that his case was dealt with very thoroughly and entirely properly . #% Last week , at an event in my constituency , trade unionists were taken aback at the sheer breadth of legislation that we had been able to enact , and ensured that Member States enacted , in favour of their rights . #% There are , however , different types of farming , and therefore it would be misleading to say that it favours non-chemical methods , because agriculture is agriculture . #% From what I have seen , I am not over-optimistic . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , this is not the first time that I have heard the President of the Commission and Heads of State come to this Chamber after a summit in the ancient city of Lisbon , proclaiming the whole thing to be a fantastic success and an example of how successful the European Union is . #% 
We want best practice to be followed . #% We also have concerns about the research element within this particular report . #% Under the Nice plans they are allocated two seats fewer than Belgium , Portugal and Greece - although those countries have a comparable population with Hungary and the Czech Republic . #% A Zimbabwean women who spoke at that conference said that the conference should be renamed ` Third World , No Hope ' , and that was her view of the different situation . #% Sadly , we in the UK have long been aware of the dangers of mining waste since the terrible disaster of Aberfan in 1966 and the terrible deaths that occurred there . #% If we get that agreement , it would certainly be the minimum that I could accept because what we will be doing is agreeing a declaration on how to violate the Treaty . #% He used his skills and knowledge to intervene in the wars of that time , mainly to save his own skin - it has to be said - rather than from any philanthropic designs . #% We have no way of knowing whether they are actually official documents or whether they are made up , but it just shows what happens when you do not have enough transparency and you do not share information . #% My group was nevertheless prepared to accept the joint resolution in its entirety , including paragraph 5 , although not totally happy with that paragraph , in the interest of reaching the widest possible consensus . #% Let me finally quote this President , if you will allow me : ` My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government . #% Actually , island people are by nature resourceful . #% I am putting the position of my group in the absence of Mrs Roth-Behrendt who , as some will know , is in hospital in Berlin . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr ≈êry on producing an excellent report . #% In this ideological approach the Liberals are supported by other economic liberals , including most British Conservatives . #% Had they checked the vehicle in Belgium some of these lives could certainly have been saved . #% What is different about telecommunications as opposed to water , gas or electricity is that technology is going to mean extending the possibilities very considerably and we do not know the time-scale of that . #% It is going to be very difficult and I look forward to receiving some reassurance from you . #% I would also like to know whether the Commission is aware of the American amendments to our regime which have been drawn up at this moment and whether it intends to object to them , as I hope . #% Mr President , I speak on behalf of Mr Ferber , who is unable to be with us this evening , and also in my capacity as PPE-DE Group shadow rapporteur to Mrs Gill . #% Members States must recognise that free movement is not a threat to them , it is not an inconvenience , it is a valuable way to increase understanding and to develop cooperation within the Union . #% In many cases the Liberal Democrats will support them . #% I am glad the decision has been taken not to impose quotas on import issues since this would have been disastrous for the whole supply chain and for consumers , and I think we all agree on that . #% I asked who that person was . #% One certain consequence of this would be an increase in the overall expenditure of the budget . #% Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government ' . #% Do any of these countries have a reputation for high welfare standards ? #% On the contrary , we see the 2007 budget as being a real opportunity to set a new strategic tone to the way in which the European Union delivers its policy agenda . #% Mr President , we welcome the opportunity to work with the President-designate of the Commission and with the Commission . #% As he so rightly highlighted , that is the bulk of the problem in terms of the surplus that this Parliament is addressing . #% We then set up a Commissioners ' group under President Prodi to make a thorough analysis . #% In a rapidly developing world , we already know that small - and medium-sized enterprises are a key target for enhanced electronic communications . #% There are two main possibilities of obtaining medical care outside the state of residence . #% What I would like the Commission to confirm , if possible , is if the work at Temel√≠n follows the recommendations of twelve inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and that it will , in fact , create safety standards equivalent to those in our Member States . #% The South Africans managed to get agreement that their trade negotiations would be renamed ` trade and development ' negotiations . #% Madam President , I could not allow to go by default possibly my last opportunity in this Parliament to point out the nonsense of spending over ECU1 billion subsidising the growing of a product which kills and maims its consumers . #% It was an undated letter but I assume it was issued yesterday . #% The last thing they need is for that perpetual disaster -- the EU -- to turn up and make things worse ! #% Madam President , I just wanted to say that I was present at the session yesterday . #% The result has been a thaw in relations which we should welcome in the EU . #% While I am fully in support of strong , effective and costed legislation to force improvements in environmental standards governing water quality and other matters , and of the proper policing of such legislation , I would also like to see this stick approach complemented by , as it were , a degree of carrot . #% This excellent report enjoyed considerable cross-party support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and , in spite of originating from the other side of the House , deserves our full support . #% Are there demands to do something ? #% I think it is clear what the intention was in drafting it this way , but it has not been very well rendered in the English language version and it would be useful to correct it . #% Yet the fact that the IMF and the World Bank are now ` talking the talk , but not walking the walk ' suggests that pressure from civic society can have an impact . #% Because , more than anything else , if you deliver on more jobs you will earn the eternal gratitude of our voters . #% We have to import some of those products and a lot of them come from the United States , where many of the products are remunerated . #% The British public would be extremely unhappy if this right was curtailed by having to make a payment . #% That is why we need to build in a few extra clauses . #% The Commission is still too willing to make the unthinking assumption that trade liberalisation is an aim in itself , rather than a tool to serve the greater purpose of sustainable development . #% Let us not only assess what is perceived to be best for European farmers and producers , let us at last and at least look as if we are prepared in our deliberations to consider the people on much poorer continents than our own . #% While I welcome the Valencian authorities reviewing the policy of land appropriation , there is still a need for justice for citizens who have already lost land and property . #% If you only want the one and not the other , you would not go with us . #% It is really not the place of the EU to be regulating in the sporting world , especially with the global nature of this particular problem . #% However , set against savings of EUR 26 billion , there is a huge cost benefit to this device . #% I would like to conclude by thanking all my colleagues on the committee for the support they have given me through this budget process . #% Mr President , if it does not embarrass Mr Wynn too much , I would like to heap further praise upon him . #% It is true that if an industry is highly regulated , it has a duty to inform the public , as well as the authorities , and arguably it should be like Caesar 's wife , that is to say , quite beyond reproach , and should take all steps to inform people of the situation . #% Secondly , the priorities of the budget for 2004 are well set out in the annual policy strategy document in terms of the three points that are made . #% Mr President , I have always considered this directive to be an infringement of workers ' rights to work the hours they wish , believing that it is an inalienable right of the individual to chose one 's own balance between work and leisure time . #% The second amendment looks at the issue of having two parts to the Treaty : the constitutional part , looking at the main principles and the institutional provisions , and the small print dealing with policies . #% I rather regret therefore that the temporary committee has chosen to draw attention to , and I quote , ` the high quality of the Commission 's work in controlling the crisis ... stressed by the national veterinary authorities of Member States concerned ' . #% For example , as you well know , I have long been an advocate of Ukraine 's EU membership , and I remain convinced that absorbing Ukraine is definitely in the EU 's strategic interest . #% There should be room for manoeuvre at the national level and if regulation is introduced it should , in my view , to the highest possible extent , be in the form of framework directives rather than detailed rules . #% That is an enormous opportunity for European producers . #% President-in-Office , I have been pleased that you have been as committed to the vital project to complete the internal market as we are on our side , and we will continue to work strongly with the British presidency to bring it to a conclusion and to build on the work that you have done . #% We believe that these specific examples will help readers make the connection between EU policy and our ability to deliver real changes to the lives of real people right around the world . #% 
And part of that reason of course is that much of our military is based on the cold war principles of static defence and not the modern principles of rapid reaction . #% If the Commission comments support the Council 's position , then of course we will have to re-consider . #% Article 2 of the Protocol annexed to the Coal and Steel Community Treaty actually makes it a legal obligation . #% But the budget is a concern . #% I am well aware that even people working within the institutions will continue to face certain problems because of such relationships . #% I just want to ask Mrs Gradin whether she is aware that a number of Members of this House will warmly welcome her statement ? #% There is a great deal that we can support in the resolution , especially concerning lifelong learning , SMEs , corporate social responsibility , disadvantaged regions and the fight against discrimination . #% The Commission , out of the goodness of its heart , was trying to do the Council a favour by putting these changes into this SAB . #% We may be facing terrible times ahead but it is essential that we have the courage as well as the compassion to consider carefully the alternatives . #% All Member States need the flexibility to organise their own working time . #% I have to say that many have questioned the need for some aspects of this measure . #% We needed the Pakistan authorities to tell us that the London suicide bombers had been to Pakistan and probably on to Afghanistan , where they underwent terrorist indoctrination and training . #% As our rapporteur has pointed out , this would mean the whole process could drag on for many years , confusing the situation and undermining the effectiveness of the legislation . #% We need to use our coal reserves better . #% If we are truly a people 's Europe , we must put the people first and protect them from abuses such as these . #% At the same time , people 's aspirations for more freedom and greater participation in decision-making , have grown , fuelled by rising incomes , education and information flows . #% That is something in which we have a role to play in the JPA , and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and elsewhere , because , unless governments make this a priority , I am afraid we are whistling in the wind . #% Until we have that full assessment , it would be irresponsible to follow the rapporteur 's lead , because we would be law-making in the dark . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - I speak tonight because , as has been mentioned , two constituents - Michael Turner and Jason McGoldrick - are imprisoned in Unit 2 of the Central Budapest jail in Hungary . #% The rapporteurs explain that they support that body : ` since it ensures that the overarching objective of gender equality ... will not be second to any other anti-discrimination policy at EU level ' . #% I am all in favour of cutting noise and making life more pleasant , peaceful and calm . #% It must do something to stop it . #% One of the key things to have emerged is uneven enforcement across the Union and the lack of political will by Member States to make the enforcement system work . #% I believe clean coal does have a future and I thank the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy for its report which at least starts this discussion going . #% In development specifically it has included the legally-binding , contractual participation laid down in the Cotonou Agreement , a principle that we believe should be extended to the EU 's relationship with all regions of developing countries in the world . #% Since we are now on the brink of central and eastern enlargement , it seems to me that this period should be one for reflection as we bring in new countries , although possibly not a united Cyprus . #% - that the Commission had failed to draw the appropriate conclusions from the Eurostat affair , and that it had failed to accept its political responsibility either collectively or individually #% We must take action there . #% The Brok report reveals a different set of motives . #% However , I compliment the Transport Committee on the amendments it has tabled which have now made this report one of substance . #% This Parliament challenged the original agreement between the US and the EU because it believed that the legal basis was wrong and disagreed with the substance . #% British Conservative members of the EPP-ED Group support the Hieronymi report - C6-0443 / 2005 - particularly because it includes support for co - and self-regulation and the 30-minute rule for advertising slots . #% Finally , I would make the point that it is a mistake for the Commission to propose that we remove the five-year renewal requirement for marketing authorisation . #% I hope that the Commission will take that view in its relations with the WTO . #% We need to use intermediaries , such as Turkey , to help with that dialogue and speed up temporary assistance to the Palestinian people . #% They should , however , have been aware of how the situation was developing and I am sure a few telephone calls would soon have put the Commission in the picture . #% May we insist that other international donors focus on small-scale health projects to implement the World Health Organisation master plan on health . #% Therefore , on Europe Day , I think this is a notable achievement that we have reached at this stage . #% Several of my colleagues have asked me that question , and quite frankly , I do not know the answer to it . #% At the moment there is a public enquiry into the expansion of Heathrow Airport to almost twice its present size . #% I wish finance ministers would take note of this . #% All these are to be welcomed . #% The Palestinian people as such may be a deserving case for humanitarian aid , but such aid should not come from the European Union , whose own accounts have not been signed off by its own auditors for 11 consecutive years . #% Mr Barroso , it is not a case of going too quickly , you are going in the wrong direction . #% Nothing can be done about that , but the position of the ALDE Group remains that we will not agree to the VIS Regulation unless and until we have an adequate framework decision on data protection , and we are utterly committed to everything that Mrs Roure , as rapporteur , is doing to seek to promote that decision on data protection . #% We are opposed to the second half of Amendment No 15 from the Verts/ALE Group , which is entirely unworkable and would raise a number of practical problems if it were adopted . #% It has been extremely difficult because of the difficulties I have outlined to you , but we might be able to make some progress . #% We advise the House , however , that such efforts would be certain to attract formal complaints and court cases and therefore lead to delays and indeed to unnecessary ill will . #% We need to increase our funding to ensure that people can survive these diseases . #% However , like my colleague the rapporteur , I have been concerned about the way the Council has formulated the common position and , in particular , has placed many of the declarations on how it will interpret the provisions of this proposal in its private Minutes . #% It is a good idea in theory but it has not yet delivered in practice . #% I asked him to consider that re-interpretation which is confirmed in the Verbatim Report of Proceedings . #% This may well be the last report that Mr Kellett-Bowman draws up on the decentralised agencies . #% I therefore ask the Commission to be careful in its application of these regulations and to take account of these genuine concerns . #% He is absolutely right . #% I found some of the scenes quite distressing and quite offensive . #% The reason for all the carping and complaints about this building is , as my colleague , Mr Callanan says , that actually we do not want to come here and we want to stay in Brussels . #% There is a certain difference in outlook between Mrs Figueiredo 's report and the Barroso Commission . #% It is essential to know -- before the vote on Thursday -- whether , if the EUR 200 million is agreed by Parliament and then spent quickly , the Commission will come back and provide more money next year , based on needs . #% We all agree that it would be devastating to the EU 's reputation and credibility if those allegations were found to be true . #% We do not support the extension of the FISCALIS programme to cover direct taxes , in particular income tax and capital tax . #% The coal is still there , if we care to use it , but the fish have almost gone , due to the disaster that is common fisheries policy . #% Mr President , I would like to refer to Mrs Angelilli 's remarks at the beginning of the debate , when she spoke of this issue as being very complicated from a legal point of view . #% We also recognise that extra expenditure resulting from the European External Action Service and the new European supervisory authorities is essential to implement these important new activities , and is supported by all Member States , including the UK , in the Council . #% You have been losing referendums and you have chosen to ignore the results . #% We are basically satisfied with the direction that those proposals go in because they seem to me to be crucially important . #% 
The court would then act as judge and jury in its own case . #% We oppose proposals to remove the national veto in areas of police and judicial cooperation , a violation of national sovereignty that would leave the UK even less able to control its borders and defend its integrity . #% In that spirit I have two specific questions for the EPP-ED Group , which has been keen to promote itself as the liberal voice on this issue and yet , I fear , may be voting quite differently tomorrow . #% Let us look forward rather than constantly harking back . #% How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union , not just certain areas of it ? #% They won and I lost , to my regret and possibly their surprise . #% The Council should also commit to biotechnology as a key new technology and the Stockholm Summit would be a useful time for them to do this . #% As you might expect as the Committee on Budgets ' rapporteur for the satellite agencies , I would like to concentrate particularly on paragraph 18 in her report . #% The world 's last ancient forests are being lost at a rate of more than 13 million hectares a year with devastating impact . #% We are all suffering from `` summititis '' , a condition in which wildly inflated expectations puff up before each summit . #% Subsidies have not delivered prosperity and security for British farmers ; in fact , often subsidies and quotas are being capitalised into the high cost base of our industry . #% Even curiouser , no one on the Budgets Committee , including the chairman , seems to know anything about these figures , even though they appear in the Budgets Committee 's opinion . #% China #% Mr President , there is not a lot more which needs to be said , because most of it has been said by Mr Blokland . #% So , whom does it protect , and from what ? #% Please Mr Prodi , ignore your friends on the Left and stick with the new world not the old world . #% I would like to make the case as strongly as possible that the mandate given to you in 1999 , even before the Seattle Ministerial - let alone the Doha and Canc√∫n Ministerials - must now be null and void . #% Controls of official exports are important , but the illegal trade in arms is our biggest problem . #% The plan is to show everybody that the ship is steady , that everything is going well , that all the Irish have to do is to correct their rather silly little mistake - and indeed your working document is written as if the Treaty were already ratified . #% The European Union must now move on and concentrate on the real work at hand , in building dynamic and competitive economies and in creating a strong global trading system and , specifically during the course of the weeks ahead , in securing a really effective agreement on climate change . #% However , overall , we can not give our support to this proposal because we do not believe in the upwards harmonisation of tobacco taxes . #% Instead , we have a common fisheries policy that has been an environmental disaster already . #% We share your frustration at the lack of outcomes . #% The Presidents of the Council and of the Commission should be absolutely clear that the IGC can not take our consent for granted . #% So Amendment No 8 should be supported by the PPE-DE Group as a recommendation . #% We still have farms in the United Kingdom that have restrictions on stock movements left over from the Chernobyl disaster two decades ago ! #% We will have to try to do what we can to make sure the Senate recognises where reality is . #% Secondly , I welcome , and I call for wider attention to , paragraph 108 , concerning human rights abuses against disabled people . #% Three months have passed already , and this has been going on since 1999 . #% For a start , we must truly move away from the medical model of disability to the social and rights-based model of disability . #% Please concentrate on civil justice . #% Have you had any thoughts about whether it might be necessary to reform the GSP , so that those who are perpetrating human rights violations , Colombia in particular , are actually excluded from the scheme across the board ? #% Second , on human rights and business , a major faultline has been identified in our debates between the promotion of corporate responsibility by companies themselves and public authorities using our responsibility to ensure the principle of corporate accountability . #% The public interest in access to justice must , I believe , be our overriding goal and not the protection or convenience of lawyers who may find it more comfortable to continue to provide services in the way they have always done . #% We may not be able to stop the US from shooting itself in the foot , but we ought to be able to stop it shooting the rest of us in the foot . #% No European-aided town in the Nordic countries or in Austria , currently exceeds the 100 000 population mark ; their needs must not be ignored . #% Opponents of the European Arrest Warrant of course do not want any EU action on rights either ; they just want ` European Arrest Warrant minus ' . #% Mr President , I should like to make four points . #% The disaster also reminds us of the need for far-reaching international action to limit environmental damage from climatic change , which will otherwise cause ever more frequent catastrophes , some even worse than the one we are talking about this evening . #% Article 17 of the Staff Regulations , meanwhile , requires officials , whether in work or on personal leave , not to disclose to any unauthorised persons information not already made public . #% - Madam President , I wholeheartedly support Europe 's moves to become an eco-friendly continent . #% In an effort to provide for equal treatment across the EU , the principles of unity and universality are the central pillars , of course , of this report , and coherence and consistency are therefore attained . #% If subsidiarity is to mean anything at all , such priorities should be for local decision . #% It is important that we set limit values and that we do so in a sensible way , although we already have limit values set in the United Kingdom . #% Firstly , I believe that member states involved in ECHELON must disengage from this murky , undemocratic system - the report does not make this clear . #% That legitimacy can only flow from parliamentarians . #% I hope that Indonesia will now both set an example by holding out the hand of friendship to the new nation of Timor Loro Sae as it becomes independent on 20 May , but I also hope that it will learn from Timor in dealing with other parts of Indonesia , particularly the Moluccas , Papua , Sulawesi and Aceh . #% British Conservative MEPs support high standards of human rights in the world , but overall abstained on the report in the final vote as it included issues like ` Reproductory Rights ' - which effectively mean abortion - and the death sentence , which are individual conscience matters , as well as advocating policy areas like the ICC , and the Lisbon Treaty , which we have a party position opposing . #% The MARIN Institute in the Netherlands found the main reasons for container stack collapses were faulty lashings , overweight containers and faulty stowage . #% In Colombia I was told that BP 's two-year-old social agreement with the local community remains unfulfilled and that Ram√≥n Marino is one of a number of ex - and current BP employees now working in the government to smooth the agreement of environmental permits . #% . -- Mr President , the horrifying images and tragic personal stories following the earthquake of 8 October might have left our television screens and the front pages of our newspapers , but let us not forget the need for urgent aid is just as great , particularly because of the onset of winter . #% However , we do not feel there is justification at this stage for the creation of some sort of new European research institute for this purpose . #% I am also delighted that the basis for the European proposals are those which have already been applied in Britain . #% Accordingly , instead of imposing blanket restrictions on some 15 000 square miles of the North Sea , I trust that it will opt for seasonal closures in areas where the cod concentration is high . #% It is vital that the Syrian Government understands the need to distinguish between those who advocate violence or rebellion and those who simply advocate political change . #% The Belgian authorities have confirmed that the current estimated costs of the basic renovated building are EUR 605 million and the Government has confirmed its intention to make the building fit for reoccupation by 31 December 2003 . #% The same applies to the Economic and Social Committee . #% I hope Parliament will endorse our report and that the Council and the Commission will see it as supportive as well as exhortative . #% In the next 50 years the number of over-65s will double from 25 % to perhaps 50 % of the population . #% They are taking rigid and firm positions even though they know they will have to compromise if they want to succeed in December : therein lies the biggest danger facing the Intergovernmental Conference . #% For my part , I would like to focus my remarks on three aspects which concern the running of European policies and the attitudes which we have taken in Parliament in previous years to these aspects . #% Let us look as well at this intent to tear up the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty . #% I urge you , alter the priorities of the Council of Ministers , place women 's rights high on the agenda . #% Mr President , Mr Nistic√≤ said there was an oral amendment to Amendment No 43 , which is one of the ones you are trying to take en bloc . #% How can we justify in the single market today a position where people shopping in Antwerp will get entirely different deals , offers and conditions to people who shop in Rotterdam , only a few miles away ? #% The criminals must be denied their profits if we are to bring these problems under control . #% 
We are also deeply concerned by proposals for an ESDP training mission to Somalia at a time when the EUPOL mission in Afghanistan has been a failure and many European countries have been unwilling to provide troops and police for urgent training missions in Afghanistan . #% Some countries are more prepared to cooperate with CCAMLR than others as far as surveillance and monitoring are concerned . #% I fully sympathise with what the Commissioner has said and those who argue that it will not create a level playing field in cross-border takeovers in the Union . #% This is working towards a shared burden of proof . #% Does he finally agree that untying aid increases the role of the private sector within developing countries ? #% We want EU decisions relating to the use of military assets , including decisions taken on the basis of a common strategy or when implementing a joint action , to be taken unanimously . #% For instance , extending the field of qualified majority voting will immediately provoke assorted Eurosceptics and others to say in their Member States that their country is giving up the veto and giving up sovereignty . #% Enhancing cross-border cooperation is also imperative , as is encouraging citizens to create innovative new businesses . #% There are some contradictions and difficulties : for example , there is a tendency everywhere in the Union to raise retirement ages , and yet at the same time there are widespread public subsidies for early retirement . #% Nobody , I think , sensibly does . #% With the Council of Ministers and the Commission firmly in socialist hands , Europe today is going down the wrong track . #% I want to support the rapporteur and the amendments which he has brought forward , in particular in relation to cooperatives that are involved in mergers and in relation to gender balance . #% Finally , as a former chairman of the Lithuanian JPC , I would remind the Council that Russia is not a Member State of the European Union , it is not a candidate country , it does not have a veto over European Union affairs . #% Whilst it may seem to be technical work , there are very big political choices underlying many of these apparently dry legal issues . #% In particular , we need to notice that at least part of this crisis can be put down to what you might call cronyism and what others might call straightforward corruption , in some of the countries involved . #% Employers need to be able to support women without it meaning they are no longer economically viable . #% At no time would Parliament ever take out legislation that supported that . #% I understand that this is first time under any Presidency that MEPs ' questions have gone unanswered for so long . #% Looking at the Commission 's proposal , we have to ask : is it effective , and is it realistic ? #% In the coming months we will argue positively and enthusiastically for a different kind of Europe that goes with the grain of public opinion and not against it ; a Europe that gets away from the obsessions of the past and moves forward with the people 's real agenda , which is jobs , growth and prosperity . #% The opinion of the Committee on Employment looked at the different stages of the tendering process and made a number of recommendations for each of those stages . #% However , I would like to ask for more noise and excitement over the small clause , under ` participatory democracy ' , that deals with the citizens ' right of initiative . #% I would say that there is no part of Iraq which is currently safe . #% On asylum policy , it is crucial that we absolutely respect humanitarian obligations and practise coherent thinking . #% It is also less than I would have wished and it should be less than this Parliament would have wished . #% I was very glad to hear in the debate so far that the EPP Group now appears to accept that these provisions should also apply within Parliament to the Members of Parliament . #% I would also like to add the hope that the Government of the United Kingdom - which is not included in the present decision of the EU Schengen zone by virtue , of course , of not being a member - will also shortly follow the same path . #% What sort of world are we living in ? #% A former colleague of mine , Mr Patten , is doing his best to make sure that we do get spending in the right sort of areas - efficiently , effectively , and to meet the needs of the various countries . #% Yes , by all means protect workers , but do not throw workers out of work ! #% To achieve this , the Commission seeks to provide full statutory recognition and commensurate benefits for all EU staff who are in partnerships that are shown to be stable in nature . #% I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Viola on an excellent report . #% How can that be done without affecting safety levels ? #% It is increasingly clear that VOC emissions have an adverse impact upon human health and the environment in general , whether it is by their contribution to creating photochemical smog , ground-level ozone in our atmosphere or stimulating asthma or even cancer in our people . #% Last night he got it from the British Foreign Secretary in Rome , announcing that we would not veto the association with Slovenia . #% If we want an EU that delivers justice both in the law we make and the way it is accessible through the courts , we have to be very careful about soft law and make sure that it is still backed in some way by the state . #% These determine the amounts Bulgaria will pay into the EU budget in various forms , as well as what she will receive in cohesion funding , nuclear decommissioning assistance , the transition facility , the Schengen facility , agriculture payments and other structural actions . #% That is quite a burden for business . #% At the heart of this debate is the issue of economic development coming right up against environmental constraints . #% It seems to me that the debate comes down to this : do we believe that the Gothenburg Protocol was the best Member States can realistically achieve ? #% I have therefore offered to work with the rapporteur to ensure those savings are found . #% The Commission is relying on endogenous growth and it is a leap of faith which I fear many European citizens will not make . #% I agree with Mrs Roure that equal opportunities are an important factor in social inclusion and that we need to combat bigotry and prejudice at all levels , whether that is on the street or in government , as it prevents so many people from reaching their potential and prevents society benefiting from their talents . #% Thirdly and finally , I wish to warn my colleagues in the PPE Group . #% Currently both countries are strongly pro-European Union . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I recognise that there are differing views on Turkish accession both between and within the political groups in this Parliament , my own included . #% Even those who live under the flight path are happy to do so because of the economic benefits the airport brings to the conurbation . #% Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on her diligence in preparing and seeing through this report , and to echo a previous speaker who said of Mr Maaten 's report - but it is equally true of this one - that it is a model of the second-reading procedure . #% Mr President , following the demise of Edwina Currie , the British health minister , who in 1988 said that most of the UK 's egg production was infected with salmonella , it is a brave British politician who makes a speech on this subject . #% I too wish to thank the Commissioner for the very encouraging news he has given us this afternoon . #% Feelings are running high in Britain and the crisis must be resolved quickly , otherwise there will be tit-for-tat retaliation on both sides of the channel . #% There is a lost generation of Somali professionals - doctors , teachers , civil servants - who fled the country before the war and have not returned . #% Already the Windward Isles report that 24 000 small producers have dropped to 7 000 under dollar-country pressure . #% I should first like to take the opportunity to thank you and your services very much for the prompt response that you referred to . #% I extend my deepest sympathy to the victims and their families . #% in writing . - I am the strongest supporter of genuine human rights and therefore have no difficulty with many aspects of this report . #% I do not approve of EU quangos such as the so-called ` EU Agency for Fundamental Rights ' or indeed funding from public money of the constellation of NGOs pushing the Left 's agenda . #% Mr President , this is a very old issue that has taken too long to come to this stage , and without the work of Mrs Wemheuer we would probably still be wandering around in the dark . #% I want to make stronger points about the Code of Administrative Behaviour . #% Demobilization is an important part of this . #% We believe that the use of the death penalty should be a matter of conscience for each individual . #% I would repeat what other speakers have said : for us the period in question is nine years . #% There is then a real and current threat over which some degree of international control is exercised , really by two means : the economic sanctions and the maintenance by Britain and America on behalf of the international community of the no-fly zone covering about a third of the territory of Iraq . #% I voted for the Van Velzen report with some reservations . #% Last month this Parliament passed a resolution in favour of human rights in Nigeria . #% It is important that the European Union does not suffer competitive disadvantage , vis-√†-vis other parts of the world , as far as our engineering skills are concerned . #% 
However , if we now look back with a certain sense of perspective , we can see that cumulatively it started a process leading to four successive IGCs , the Single Act , Maastricht , Amsterdam and Nice and now the Constitution coming up . #% The Finnish nation is famous for its openness but so far we have reached November in your Presidency and this is still a disaster . #% The Socrates Programme is important for that and so making it more efficient as Ms Pack 's report urges is really very important . #% It is preposterous that tobacco companies are trying to destroy this legislation . #% I have no problem at all if these prove technically difficult to achieve - no problem , because Britain has a shameful record of having the lowest household waste recycling in Europe and great room for improvement . #% We have the situation that 12 of the 15 Member States have not introduced a voluntary system of beef labelling and are therefore not in a position to move to a compulsory scheme in January . #% It would remove that threat to people like my constituents if Pakistan were to be a democratic society . #% In terms of general principles , we believe that it is vitally important to restrict the areas where state aid can be given . #% I hope we can put to rest some of the assertions and allegations that are still flying around about what is going on in the UK as well . #% In the ten years since the clause was introduced it has stood up to rigorous examination by the European Court of Justice and has been introduced into more than 50 of the EU 's agreements . #% Mr President , I am aware of the fact that I trespassed on the patience of the House earlier in order to try and make a full reply . #% Mr President , this is nothing to do with aeroplanes , although I could speak about flights if you wished me to . #% What will the role of the Commission and this institution be ? #% The fact we have negotiations now is largely due to European Union leadership . #% Perhaps in practice we have made some modifications . #% I think she and I now , over a period of two or three years , have enjoyed working together on this report on behalf of Parliament . #% Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing . #% I voted in favour of this report and I support the principle of Turkish accession to the European Union upon completion of the accession negotiations and provided that Turkey meets the necessary standards in terms of human rights , the functioning of the democratic system , respect for minorities and coming to terms with its past . #% As Baroness Ludford has said , every application must be dealt with on its own merits . #% Only yesterday in this House we debated our priorities for the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva . #% 500 million Europeans travelled by coach in 2005 , many of them elderly people . #% The best basis is the existing burden-of-proof legislation , which is now underpinned by 25 years of case-law , and where the numbers are not available , expert opinion will suffice . #% Doing this through points of single contact ( PSCs ) will allow the service sector to benefit from cross-border trade . #% Mr President , you will not be surprised that , as a British Conservative , I am going to sound a slightly discordant note in these otherwise harmonious proceedings . #% Most of the flax and hemp grown in the UK is on land ineligible for arable area payments . #% I believe we are able to do that . #% The European state is here . #% That is the only power the Union has . #% After all I have said that Hong Kong millionaires should not subsidize the British Conservative Party as they have been doing up to now ! #% If we were to look at ourselves now we would find ourselves at the last climb , in the mountains , with most of the gruelling race behind us and very much with the finishing line in sight , with the Champs Elys√©es in Paris waiting for us . #% However , we managed to get a huge majority at first reading across this House , and you will likely see a similar pattern repeated here today . #% The cricket aspect may seem irrelevant but it does show a determination to succeed and Bangladesh will do well in this field of test cricket and this will be an inspiration to millions of people in that country . #% However , the one thing I have spoken on more times in this House since 1999 than any other subject are the appalling European Union fisheries deals with black Africa . #% Mr President , I speak first on behalf of the committee and will speak later on behalf of my group . #% I know other members of the Socialist Group will raise aspects concerning production in the Caribbean , perhaps my friend Mr Wynn , and Mr Medina on production within the Community . #% The second point concerns the budget . #% Mr President , with enlargement , once again , the European vision is back on home territory in many ways . #% It suggested that an international ad-hoc tribunal be set up to try Saddam Hussein and his officials , and that the Commission should set up an office of human rights to collect the evidence . #% What a pity it is that the Council and the Commission do not focus their efforts on putting the European Union house in order before enlargement instead of grandiose political schemes . #% May would be a much better time in any case to have European elections . #% It was interesting that , when the Commission report itself came out , there was an article in the on Tuesday , 6 January , co-authored by Catherine Barnard and Simon Deakin , professing surprise at the way their report had been misinterpreted . #% If we do not include falls from heights , the only certainty is that there will be more and the rate will increase . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , cancer affects one in three of us across the European Union and results in over one million deaths . #% None of you , it appears , seems to understand the concept of international money . #% We can not support treating Turkey differently and less favourably than other candidate states . #% I believe that the art museums of Europe have many more pictures and art works than they are able to display . #% We did have many new laws in the 80s and 90s , but they were not fully implemented or complied with . #% The proposals within structural fund reform which will enable European support for housing projects and for the regeneration of derelict sites for the first time , are welcome steps forward in meeting urban needs . #% Perhaps the Commissioner can give us the figures - in particular with reference to the old liabilities at Lloyd 's that they sought to separate in the scheme known as Equitas . #% It talks about vegetable waste and vegetable waste does not cover dead animals . #% I congratulate the President-in-Office on his firmness . #% It is nothing of the sort ! #% Today , we need to know what the Commission is doing to enforce European law on this issue . #% It is essential . #% Without an agreement on the use of NATO assets , there will be no ESDP . #% The other person I want to thank is Mr Liikanen . #% Even today , 20 years on , neither side seems to care about the suffering , only about their reputations . #% The amendments proposed for plenary for the EQS vote are designed to make the text less confusing , more feasible and easier to implement . #% But at the same time , it is asking for relaxation in trade directly from Pakistan . #% Mr President , the indefinite suspension of the Doha Round creates serious risks for our global economy . #% We must let the Member States and the Commission make their proposals and then look at some of the key initiatives and put forward the point of view of the citizens , the businesses , the road-users and drivers across the European Union . #% The plaintiff does have to provide facts and it has already been said that equal opportunities for men and women cover this in European legislation as well . #% It is the famous elephant in the room that everybody avoids talking about . #% This House needs to recognise that we must come together to create better social dialogue and a better awareness and social responsibility for those in employment . #% Just a few minutes ago we heard Commissioner Oettinger 's plans to bring forward some legislation in the New Year . #% When things are finalised , the tenth EDF will have to be ratified and that presents us with enormous concerns when you consider that 25 Member States will have to be part of this ratification process . #% 
Defence policy is literally a matter of life and death : the death not of politicians , but of soldiers , sailors and airmen . #% If we do not end the opt-out , we should simply repeal the legislation and stop pretending that we want to put in place any sensible minimum standards at all on working time . #% All parties must pursue a path of positive engagement , as set out by the Quartet , which includes talks with the new Palestinian Authority . #% We also expressed the hope that it will end as soon as possible . #% I am not convinced that we are hearing answers that are going to deal with the total exploitation that exists in a lot of the textile industries in many countries throughout the world - whether through child labour , poverty wages or whatever . #% - As a former Minister in the UK for race relations I am very much aware of the need to look constantly for ways of improving relations between all groups and interests in the population . #% Is this key issue not a sort of litmus test for the adaptability of the Union ? #% I commend my report to Parliament . #% The development of a common European Security and Defence Policy should be seen as a pretext , and also as a bridge , for us to reach common positions on ways to combat terrorism while respecting fundamental rights . #% The provisions relating to nine years for junior doctors only relate to the average working week . #% By developing closer relations with these four countries , the European Union must work to develop prosperity , peace and democracy . #% Mr President , although I agree with many of the comments that have been made today about the year 2001 having been reasonably successful , there are real grounds for concern about the way in which this debate is taking place today . #% I therefore strongly support what the Commissioner has said , that Member States should now continue to invest in education and should not be using the economic climate to make cuts , because making cuts in education would be the worse possible thing to do . #% Islam is a faith that promotes peace , equality and a secure life . #% On this basis I do not see how anyone could consent to the discharge of these accounts . #% We are not proposing the blunt instrument of economic sanctions . #% The EU already has binding commitments to developing countries . #% Terrorists and organised criminals are well aware of this and do everything they can to avoid being tracked and caught by these means . #% Overwhelmingly they want trade and cooperation in Europe , they reject your political union . #% Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems . #% Not only was it the first year that I was elected - and hold back your cheers now - but in budgetary control terms it was fascinating . #% One of these concerns has been the definition of what a unit price is and how it can indicate not merely the kilogramme , the litre , the metre or whatever , but also that unit of quantity which is widely used in the Member States concerned . #% Mugabe personifies all the most negative strains in African development : corrupt and authoritarian power with state leaders lining their pockets at the expense of the people , racial division , the exploitation of envy , political violence and economic backwardness . #% We must not build a huge bureaucracy living off the back of small farmers . #% That means , President , and I say this to you because you are a member of Parliament 's Bureau , we need to restructure the committees of the European Parliament . #% The US Federal Reserve has now dropped the federal funds rate to 2.5 % - a 39-year low . #% To make sure that we are in line with that Rule , I would propose that we add an oral amendment to all three reports which would read ` Considers that the financial statement as amended is compatible with the ceiling of headings 3 and 5 of the financial perspectives 2000-2006 ' . #% I also regard Turkey 's Muslim identity -- a secular Muslim identity -- as a positive contribution to a harmonious development of the EU as a multicultural society . #% I should just like to say to colleagues from the Committee on Culture who are present that this is not an issue for that committee alone . #% They are key EU policies . #% in writing . - There are many elements to the resolution we can agree with . #% We shall raise standards of health in the European Union , not by directives , but by research , education and the identification and dissemination of good practice . #% In the first draft from the Commission there were considerable problems . #% It seems to me that what is needed here in Europe is an appreciation of the facts of the situation - what is actually happening . #% I would hope that at the end of the voting we have a clear and concise position and most of my group will be supporting it . #% For that is all Saab has been reduced to . #% We will have to watch that process like hawks . #% British Conservatives can not , therefore , accept this proposal . #% Research and jobs in this area would simply go elsewhere in the world and the European Union would be the loser . #% This is something we have to look at in the future and part of Mr Cunha 's report talks about it . #% I should like you to comment more specifically on their argument that the fall in price that is integral to two of the Commission 's three options would ` make the EBA initiative meaningless for sugar . #% Laskar Jihad 's website used to boast of links to Bin Laden terror groups . #% I do not see how we can run a Commission with only 10 to 12 Commissioners when most governments have at least 30 to 35 ministers to run their own countries . #% Someone has just referred to Mr Tsatsos 's report as a minor miracle in that respect and I support that view . #% The ELDR Group fully supports Mr Pirker in his insistence that Article 202 of the Treaty should be followed in its general rule that implementation powers for this regulation should be conferred on the Commission . #% The rapporteur 's last point , the proposal for a European Forum of Enterprises in paragraphs 61 to 63 , is an interesting one . #% I do not want to debate the content now but I do want to ask that this be maintained on the agenda , because after what has happened over the weekend , there is still a risk of considerable discrimination against one ethnic group in Fiji . #% There may be then , in the case of EC regulations , simply a right of veto at the end or , if we feel that the work has not been done properly , we will simply not accept it until it comes back in its finally completed form . #% Mr President , on a point of order further to those that have already been raised , I would also like to ask the Presidency of Parliament to consider exactly what the rules are -- and how they are enforced -- as to the use of cameras filming Members going about their duties . #% Secondly , it is vitally important that all Member States should be invited to review the legal , economic and social support systems for the victims of violence and the protection that is provided against further attacks . #% However , with all the excitement and interest in cross-Atlantic acquisitions , it seems likely that perhaps something more momentous than a mere affiliation was afoot , at least in the minds of some . #% The greatest threats to our world need confronting , and practical and workable solutions need to be found . #% Further , if the labelling scheme in relation to category were to be implemented , as the Commission has earlier suggested , it could add 8 to 10 % to production costs . #% I have to ask , is the European Community ready to act swiftly before things deteriorate in Burma ? #% The United States of America has the Echelon system that enables it to intercept every form of international communication . #% Too often they go to the Internet and get information that may be misleading or may be dangerous . #% The rapporteur talks about the Marshall Plan in his conclusions to the report . #% I do not think we could find a better commentary on the process that we are currently undergoing . #% I know that when Member States are in financial difficulties , it is quite often not easy to continue to be aware of their social obligations , hence this oral question . #% As chairman of the joint parliamentary committee , I should also like to say a few words in relation to Lithuania . #% The last time she was visited was in July . #% Secondly , the delay undermines the potential for revenue . #% Let us be clear on our position . #% We may not have accepted all their proposals but I want to assure them that we have considered everything very thoroughly indeed and we want to thank them for their contribution and for working with us . #% I know that sounds churlish , but I am pleased subsidiarity has been mentioned and we call on Member States to act and not the EU . #% In spite of considerable evidence gathered by Mrs Erica Duggan , his mother , that Jeremiah died in very worrying and suspicious circumstances , last week the Hessen State Prosecutor decided not to investigate . #% 
They are not murderers or terrorists . #% On that basis , I understand that the Commission is in full support of all the amendments and the presidency has indicated its support . #% A collective approach such as the one the Commission is proposing might undermine each EU nation 's ability to decide this . #% Ultimately , the European Union must send a clear message to the President that the transition to civilian rule through free and fair elections is ... #% The arguments about cars , alcohol or even about sweets being banned next all founder against the reality of the effects of passive smoking , and we have plenty of other safety measures for those products . #% Unfortunately , we will not be able to hide this oil behind the piles of fridges currently found in my own country and I am afraid that much of this oil will find its way into the drains of the country , causing environmental damage and also , I suggest , public health problems as it congeals and solidifies in the sewers of our major cities . #% We need a dialogue on human rights , we need a dialogue on weapon sales , we need a dialogue on economic development . #% It also allows for the annual negotiation of the contribution to the food aid budget . #% Many voices were raised in conciliation about the importance of business impact assessment on proposals of this sort - rigorous impact assessment . #% Tempting as it is to build Europe without France , it would surely be better to try to bring France on board first . #% I would also stress that specifically in response to Parliament 's concern , the 18th Annual Report relating to the year 2000 will contain a specific section on the management of exceptions to the harmonisation which Member States enjoy under Article 95 of the Treaty . #% It is vital that even as we pay necessary and proper attention to tsunami relief , we also remain focused on the wider and longer-term issue of poverty reduction and the millennium development goals . #% It is always a question of staying one step ahead . #% Reinsurers should be included in the scope of this directive . #% Those are extremely wise words and we all look forward to them being translated into action . #% My answer to them is that the choice at the moment is between the new Constitution and the old one -- our current Treaties . #% Where we in the Socialist Group have a reservation is on the legal control of subsidiarity . #% We also need to consider our own approach . #% Thirdly , there is in equity in terms of the responsibility for meeting the costs . #% Last week the President of Ecuador , Mr Fabi√°n Alarc√≥n , while opposing the present licences system , said in an answer to me personally that his country had no wish to injure others and would be prepared to discuss alternatives . #% You might say that we have been tripped up by the acronym of TRIMs . #% Perhaps Mr Chichester could check this in the extensive report that Ms McCarthy has put together . #% Whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer . #% We have to find new working methods that fully respect Parliament 's position as co-legislator with the Council . #% It has so far contributed to the extradition of almost 12 000 drug smugglers , child sex offenders , rapists and terrorists , and has avoided lengthy extradition procedures in the process . #% Mr President , any Vice-President of this Parliament other than yourself would actually of course remember that when the Coal and Steel Community was set up only six states broke away from the then 14 that comprised the Council of Europe and its somewhat larger parliamentary assembly . #% All of us agree with that . #% Because we had to make time available to delegations from other committees , neither the members of my group nor our committee nor the members of the delegations had sufficient time to put all the questions that they wanted to candidate Commissioners Liikanen and Lamy . #% It is absolutely ludicrous to keep it in . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I want to express my disappointment that yet again , this Parliament is considering a report that pre-empts the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty . #% We have in Sellafield a situation I can only describe by saying that we are expecting a spectacular nuclear orgasm any time now because there is in that place a pit which it is suspected may explode at any time . #% I would like to mention again the problem of the name . #% The current problems started because the armed groups were not prepared to concede control over the prisons to the authorities . #% The six questions that the Commissioner sent to the Community health ministers seem to me to be the right ones , but the question remains as to whether he gets the right answers from them in terms of the way we can mobilise our stocks of anti-virals prior to the development of a vaccine . #% Conversely , the Council of Europe is discredited by its continued acquiescence towards Russia 's authoritarian government . #% The Commission says it will be national governments that ultimately decide the number of people they accept , and that Britain and other countries will not be forced to accept large numbers of economic migrants that it can not cope with or can not support in these economically challenging times . #% Both parliamentary and presidential elections in 2000 sadly highlighted the flawed nature of the electoral process . #% We will follow it up very closely . #% I am not sure why Parliament has decided to bring forward an urgent resolution at this time , unless it wants to contribute something useful in the context of the current international crisis , the continuing threat posed by weapons held by terrorists or the consequences of the large accumulation of weapons in Taliban hands in Afghanistan . #% How is it organised ? #% We feel very strongly about this issue in my constituency with last year the experience of the Sea Empress and the impact of that on the local environment . #% It remains a failing and rogue state which means that the West , including the European Union , must tread very carefully in its attempts to engage with North Korea and bring it out of the cold . #% The murder of four Serbian policemen over the weekend , supposedly by the KLA , only helps those who wish to undermine this process . #% Without them I do not think we would be at this stage in the proceedings . #% We commend it to the Council and to Parliament as a whole . #% In relation to that , there will be an amendment moved by Mr Tillich , the rapporteur , agreed by Mr Waidelich , which our group will be supporting . #% In general , most of the liberally-minded market-opening fraternity were pleased to get it on the statute book . #% Mr President , a series of quite practical and well-argued and debated figures were arrived at just before Christmas at Gothenburg under the UN/ECE protocol , and it seems to me that is the logical place to start . #% This approach makes little sense , given the fact that six EU Member States , including the United Kingdom - my own - are permanent observers . #% I hope the monitoring of the spending of that money will be very stringent and that we will see results over the four years . #% I also think we must be sure that powers are devolved to the North Sea Advisory Council and that the Commission takes notice of it . #% The code 's influence goes beyond the EU : all the accession countries , the EEA , EFTA States , Canada and Turkey now subscribe to the code 's principles . #% At the same time I acknowledge the work the Commissioner has played in it too . #% This the point Parliament made in the Bullman report . #% It is profoundly important from the point of view of health and safety , and road safety more generally , and it is also important from the point of view of ensuring fair competition between the road , rail and other transport sectors . #% My professional life has been in broadcasting and that in turn gave way to what in English is called ` narrow-casting ' subscription cable and things like that , and there was the person-to-person communication via the telephone . #% I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the numerous detailed replies and appreciate both the close contact maintained with the United Nations and the crucial role of James Baker . #% Reform is therefore an essential precondition - a precondition for realising our vision of Europe . #% Madam President , my party can not support the candidature of the President for the institution because we do not support the institution over which he desires to preside . #% We sense that there are often fine political decisions to be made and that these are best taken by politically accountable ministers rather than by judges . #% However , in order to do that we must have discussion and debate . #% Finally , during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries . #% We have seen this in my own country , for example , in the railway and nuclear industries . #% Madam President , I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan . #% If the British delegation abstains on this report , it is for the reason that I have outlined . #% The municipal elections in March 2003 showed that some favourable political developments have taken in Belarus . #% 
From our point of view we British Conservatives have four cardinal principles : firstly salary should be comparable to our national MPs ' salaries ; secondly we should pay the same tax as our constituents ; thirdly the expenses regime should be cleaned up ; and finally there should be a clean break with the past . #% I wonder if we can use this conflict and these negotiations with the US to enter into a broader discussion about a proactive global environmental policy on air transport more generally . #% I just want to mention two areas specifically this evening . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Kellett-Bowman on his two reports . #% The barriers it mentions , if removed , would lead to growth of over 3 % GNI each year , year-on-year . #% The compromise text revolutionises the rights and procedures for access to documents of the institutions and sets in motion the enshrining of freedom of information in the EU and in Member States ' national legislation . #% It looks as though we will have to wait for the new millennium now for a Millennium Round . #% The democratic decision of the Irish people can not be ignored or ridden roughshod over . #% We want to work with all partners including business itself to try to assess the direction of change . #% Food is a single market and food safety is a public health issue . #% That threat of withholding money from Member States brought about a dramatic transformation in performance and the submission of new ideas . #% We want safe disposal , not toxic parcel-passing . #% But we must ensure that sanctions are effectively enforced on Serbia and we must give support to the efforts of the Albanian , Bulgarian and FYROM governments in trying to stop the crisis spreading and destabilizing the whole region . #% It is a welcome contribution to the wider debate on security of supply of energy in Europe , on which I am working at present . #% The only way we can do that is through rules and through international cooperation . #% This is an important matter for my constituency of Devon and for my region of the South-West and in particular for Cornwall , which the Commissioner will know has a very strong claim for Objective 1 status . #% I welcome the positive way in which Parliament and the Council approached the conciliation phase and played their respective roles to the full to secure adoption of this decision . #% Mr President , may I start by congratulating Mrs Randzio-Plath for her tireless efforts as rapporteur and Members and staff from the secretariat of Parliament for their work . #% In the course of the discharge proceedings and in the light of the Court of Auditors ' report , we asked a series of very searching questions of the Commission . #% There are important questions . #% On this side of the House we certainly believe the Ombudsman should have all the powers that he needs to discharge his responsibilities . #% I would endorse Mrs Erika Mann 's remarks about ensuring there is an effective parliamentary element to this dialogue , so that we can make clear to each other exactly where we stand . #% It is a great disappointment to me and my group that the Turkish judicial authorities did not show themselves to have sufficient flexibility to use this opportunity of having a retrial that would effectively have exonerated Mrs Zana . #% If you were to look behind you , you would see in the bouquet of flags that the Irish Flag has been placed where the European Flag usually is , in the middle of the bouquet , presumably because Ireland is the only Member State holding a referendum on the Treaty of Nice . #% He appears to be the victim of pass-the-parcel , whereby the US and UK governments may be colluding to bundle him off to his home country Saudi Arabia . #% I wish to highlight four areas where improvements could be made . #% We would be pleased to see the people of Slovakia inside the EU . #% MS demands our attention . #% We do not deny the importance of these agreements , but we believe that if we are expending European taxpayers ' money , whether for targeted assistance or in relation to fishing rights , we should know exactly how this money is being expended . #% I also support what is perhaps the more contentious report . #% The situation in Eastern Europe is also far from reassuring . #% The Treaty guarantees the right of all citizens to family life and we , as a Parliament , are empowered to uphold this . #% Finally , a personal point , the public should be allowed to buy quotas because we want to involve the citizens in European activities and in saving the world . #% On emissions , we need concrete and efficient measures to reduce aircraft emissions , including not only voluntary measures but also emissions-related levies . #% It can also be no coincidence that the Labour Government ' s decision was criticised at the time by the boom-and-bust Conservatives , who have a record second to none when it comes to economic instability and incompetence . #% One of my great concerns is that , although this is well known , we still do not have proper controls in place at our ports and airports to prevent further illegal meat imports . #% Producers have four years from inclusion of full product dossiers for re-registration . #% We are opposed to the passerelle clauses which jeopardise our veto rights over taxation , social security and , most worryingly , CFSP , which includes security and defence . #% Many people have expressed their concern at the homophobic feelings voiced in Parliament 's Chamber . #% I am sure that the President will want to write on behalf of the European Union to congratulate all parties concerned on their actions , their courage and their determination to carry the peace process and decommissioning forward , and I am sure that you will agree that peace in Northern Ireland offers hope to everyone everywhere . #% We support the joint resolution , but , at the same time , I would endorse Mr Casaca 's comments that we should not be widening this resolution outside of its original terms . #% We are assured that we need not worry and that it does not really affect our democratic right to set our own taxes . #% This is of course an old issue . #% With hindsight , I believe it would have been better for Parliament to have let the conciliation process collapse . #% Therefore it is very important for both the Commission and this Parliament to recognize that we need to build in , not only to this report but to legislation - I am the rapporteur on the voice telephony and universal service report - periodic reviews of entitlement that are realistic and achievable . #% The whole basis of technical regulation for motor vehicles was one of the earliest areas of harmonisation within the European single market , but it has taken until now for us to have a fully comprehensive type-approval framework for all categories of motor vehicles , trailers , major component systems and critical components . #% We liked the sustainable development chapter in FTAs but wish those standards to be binding , not voluntary . #% Madam President , although the Indonesian General Election is not due to take place until 29 May , which is a week today , the result is not in doubt . #% Although many of the forum sessions were very worthwhile and indeed inspiring , the NGO voice was hijacked by the proponents of reparations for slavery and those pursuing the line that Zionism is racism . #% This amendment is necessary in order to avoid duplication of insurance , gaps in the insurance cover , or insurance without liability . #% It is often ironic that the countries that most engage in rhetoric about European cooperation are those that often fail to produce the action . #% Further than that , how quickly will the high-level group on the future of social protection begin to move into the realm of a convergence strategy for social protection that this House has called for ? #% Mr Mussa very kindly stood in for us at a meeting yesterday . #% I am grateful to the President , but I believe this was meant to be ratified in March . #% Therefore , all we ask is that you bear with us a little longer so that , together , the institutions of Europe can get this right . #% The testing standards were unrealistic and there were no separate provisions , as Mrs Hedkvist Petersen pointed out , for a separate test enabling these bars to be made available on the aftermarket . #% Then we can assess , in the light of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union , what evidence is produced . #% The kirpan is an act of faith which they may not remove , so their exclusion is a matter of religious and racial intolerance . #% The Commission text referred to the social partners and to the dialogue that exists . #% The definition of ` spouse ' may be clear according to the European Court of Justice , but it is up to us as legislators to redefine and to revisit definitions , especially in the light of modern family life and the diversity of durable and lasting relationships . #% For that , we need active labour market policies to ensure that work is rewarded , the unemployed are helped to get work , and that training and retraining are central to everything we do . #% In our view , it would be better for the EU and applicant countries to be clear on the envisaged enlargement process . #% Whilst I and my Group recognise that this has had a considerable effect on aviation ' s growth , other factors have also contributed . #% I look forward to the report . #% It certainly will play a major part in waste-management policy and that is for the good . #% We have had no satisfactory response from the Member States to our report of a year ago about such collusion . #% 
That is not going to provide a solution for Europe and it is not going to provide a solution for the rest of the world either . #% A law which said that a financial institution could only create or provide a certain core service and was not allowed to diversify into others would be too big an intervention in the market . #% I would ask you to support that . #% Those who opt to work reduced hours should not be penalized in terms of career advancement . #% Other steps too are necessary if we are going to prevent those kinds of crimes from happening again . #% The fact that over 450 amendments were tabled showed the extent of interest and the wide range of opinion as to detail . #% The second issue I focussed on was the promotion within the bounds of subsidiarity of cycling and walking within EU transport policy . #% Mr President , Amendment No 9 is the furthest from the committee 's paragraph , but if the rapporteur is of a contrary opinion , I bow to his superior experience . #% Is it not right and proper that the same person should not be judge , jury and executioner and that the person making the accusation should not also be the minister of justice at the same time ? #% We are now on the verge of a very important review of the future of the internal market . #% When enlargement takes place , the countries coming into the European Union will be expecting structural funding ; the very funding which our existing countries will be deprived of because they will not be able to benefit if we have to satisfy one budget on structural funding . #% This is extremely important if we are to bring this regulation into force . #% On the issue of nonylphenol , this is an aquatic pollutant , and although many in the committee tried to talk about health risks and bring in other factors , we must concentrate on the case at hand , which is making sure that nonylphenol does not reach water courses and is banned in applications where there is no alternative . #% I am very grateful that Commissioner Mario Monti has changed the agenda in Europe on this matter . #% The UK Independence Party 's response to this report is ` thanks , but no thanks ' . #% Applied natural science excludes engineering . #% It is not just bad for Britain : it will be bad for Bulgaria and Romania because their brightest and best young people will be lured away by money . #% All over the European Union we are seeing a merging of the ownership of the old , publicly owned utilities : telecommunications with broadcasting , electricity with telecommunications , railway links used as telecommunication networks , gas companies investing in water and over all banks taking a major share in these utilities . #% I can refer to a letter from the organisation that represents the motoring clubs across Europe , including , for example , the AA and RAC , who are broadly sympathetic and supportive of our work , because they know that unless Europe takes a lead on this issue , unless we begin pulling together the best of the ideas from across the European Union , then the cities , towns and rural areas , will continue to suffer from unacceptable levels of congestion and pollution . #% However , we believe that the continued occupancy of two seats by the European Parliament represents poor value for money to the European taxpayer and , therefore , we can not support any proposal to purchase the Strasbourg parliament buildings . #% When we were successful , the people who were opposed to Parliament 's position believed that the conclusions defied gravity and that in fact the superbikes were proved to be safer than other machines which the Commission and Council had no objection to . #% I know the Turkish authorities are looking at ways of improving the situation and so are the applicant countries and those which would like to be applicant countries . #% Please , Commissioner , think again about those amendments . #% We would like to see the European Court of Auditors conducting more checks . #% Whether one calls it genocide or not , it still amounts to the most serious systematic violation of fundamental rights probably anywhere on the globe . #% We must do the same with enlargement and constitutional reform , widening and deepening . #% We need the safety benefits of Mr Ferri ' s directive but we also need to take a much broader look at how to handle the move towards global technical standards in a crucial industry for the European Union . #% This is a health and safety issue , as has been said , for both the workers concerned and for the public . #% I congratulate the Commission on what it has done in terms of implementing the Joint Action on small arms - the project in Albania . #% Mr Rothley and others have talked particularly about issues of improving the ability of motorists to claim damages for accidents outside their own country . #% It is also vital , in my opinion , that the Bank be encouraged to follow the example of other leading central banks , such as the Federal Reserve in America , and make transparency a central feature of all its activities . #% The consequences of this are recognized in Japan ; they are now being recognized in Europe . #% We want the Council to legislate in public . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Gut√≠errez for his speech tonight and also for his Lisbon initiative , which is very important to us . #% The age of application varies from 58 to 67 . #% Also , if Parliament objected to a decision it would ` possibly ' take account of Parliament 's objection . #% The Commission notes with approval that the authorities have decided to send a high-level mission to the USA to liaise with investigators there , I think that is actually happening at the present time . #% In my own region in particular I have two airports , Manchester Airport and Blackpool Airport , that benefit considerably from duty-free and indeed there are jobs tied up in that . #% But the high profile of education in the political arena makes universities and other institutions especially vulnerable to external pressure . #% I can only conclude that Plan D stands for ` delusional ' . #% As a result , Amendment 314 to line 19 05 01 is withdrawn . #% I propose that we delete the word ` future ' so that it will read as follows : ` ... to prepare them for their roles as citizens and as members of the European Union ' . #% Under no circumstances can any terrorist attack that targets civilians , resulting in the loss of innocent lives , be accepted by the international community . #% The proceedings take place in secret and the members are nominated by governments . #% We will not be asking for a separate debate , but we have questions we wish to raise when Mr Prodi is with us on Tuesday . #% We must make sure that this legislative planning works without upsetting the whole balance of the system by delivering it in the wrong way . #% How can we have confidence in the sustainability impact assessment when the Commission could not agree amongst itself on the impact of Everything But Arms on the sugar sector ? #% That would have sought to increase economic ties with the unrecognised regime in Northern Cyprus . #% Yet we know that this year we will have lost 17 , 000 jobs in the steel sector . #% That is why I was prepared to accept amendments stating that negotiations on trade and services would not only serve the interests of the EU , but the economic growth of the poorest countries . #% In the United States the market is moving in the opposite direction from the rest of the world . #% There has been a growing catalogue of violence and human rights abuses on both sides - by the Tamil Tigers and , sadly , the government security forces . #% Mr Jospin was a party to the memorandum of agreement , which accepted the date base scheme in its entirety . #% The outcome of the referendum and the terrible consequences were very predictable . #% It is a condemnation of the European Union that 13 years after the completion of the single market , there are huge obstacles to cross-border postal activity , the work of the expanding home-shopping market and indeed for newspaper and magazine publishers . #% We must find ways which give power back to the schools and to the parents and to the students because that is where responsibility should lie . #% The ` green rate ' , as we know it , will go and for the countries not in ` euroland ' , the staged currency fluctuations of the present green pound will end and be replaced by a currency exchange rate based on the declared daily rate . #% . Mr President , in responding to this debate I wish to begin by thanking all those who paid tribute to the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the report it produced . #% I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various committees I worked with for providing me with so much support . #% If so , there will be a substantial extra cost . #% The Commission proposal goes some way to rectifying this but it does not give us total satisfaction on all those four points . #% They were sent to war on the basis of the lies and fantasies of Prime Minister Tony Blair . #% We do not want the disease to be in the details as well . #% Within limits she has done a competent and workmanlike job . #% Finally , I am delighted that people from my own region in the east of England are linked through a network called Praxis with the Arad County Council in Romania . #% It has now become some sort of pragmatic , technical exercise . #% 
Today , in the Parliament , we have a visitor who is working to increase the recycling of waste in London from less than 10 % to 50 % by the year 2005 . #% We should also not neglect radio as a good way of getting information . #% I accept that what we are referring to here is the Commission , but the Council also surely has some jurisdiction over what the Commission is doing . #% You may perhaps wish to comment on that later . #% It is particularly important that we ask the Commission to reinforce its activities , to ensure proper compliance cost assessment and to assess the costs on businesses of the new legislation . #% My message to the next Parliament is , ` Be vigilant ; keep an eye on the process ' . #% Perhaps now there can be more sympathy for Israel 's concern to ensure that Palestine is not entrenched as another terrorist State and a base for perpetual war against the Israeli people . #% We can not impose systems and procedures dreamed up in Washington and expect them to work . #% It is only a pity that that good work was put in jeopardy by the stance taken by his own group , the PPE-DE , and a faction in the Liberal Group on one aspect of the proposal : the provisions relating to the occupational risks arising from exposure to natural radiation . #% We are not dealing with the construction , the concept or the design or work equipment , but with the risks to the health and safety of workers using the equipment . #% Nevertheless , we can not be entirely blind to the fact that the 1994 framework agreement has not been fulfilled in its entirety by the US either . #% I wonder what the public would make of it . #% We have a saying in my country : ` charity begins at home ' . #% Mr Blokland has also exceeded in many ways the brief he was given . #% He is absolutely right : there is a very close link between security and the growth of the economy . #% Mr President , this concerns a matter arising from the Minutes in connection with the distribution of the report promised by Mr Kinnock in response to my oral question on Monday , which was raised in the Chamber yesterday afternoon . #% Political extremists will exploit the vacuum we create by our inaction and our prolonged deliberations , undertaken comfortably within our secure environments . #% We welcome the setting-up of the Permanent UN High Commission for Human Rights and the contribution of ECHO in assisting displaced people . #% The use of human embryos to create embryonic stem cell lines and embryonic stem cell research are contentious , but we have discussed the issues and have reached a useful consensus in the report by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy . #% Secondly , insofar as the political groups are concerned , to ensure effective control of the Administration , we would like to see them strengthened . #% I would like to recognise that the fears of the pessimists that liberalization would lead to cuts in security of supply have been confounded . #% Lastly , life is too much of a hassle for people when they try to exercise their European rights , whether it be residence permits , family reunions , social security or access to justice . #% The progress that is being made there is very good evidence of that . #% It will probably take a British judge to make them recognise the obvious truth , that a cartridge fitted with an electronic chip is an item of electronic equipment . #% We must make sure that disabled people are mainstreamed , that they are not sidelined , that they are taken into account in all sectors - in the information society , in public procurement , in employment . #% There are , however , two sides to this political tale of war and suffering , and I think we must seek more strongly to understand the causes of conflict between Russia and Chechnya , so that we can help to stem the flow of human blood more quickly another time . #% However , it is very difficult to spend huge amounts of money on prisons when there are demands from other areas . #% That presupposes a duty to inform and consult on the part of the employer . #% In order that the right compromises can be made between the different and complex issues facing the international trade system today it does indeed seem essential that the talks should cover a comprehensive agenda from traditional tariff reductions to crucial issues such as the environment and labour standards , and new topics such as competition and investment . #% Secondly , as we say in paragraph 12 , that implementation has to be part of development cooperation programmes too - not just fine words in country strategy papers but real , quantifiable programmes , assisting developing country governments to establish and operate effective labour inspectorates and giving direct aid to developing country trade unions and other civil society and watchdog groups , to provide an independent voice in tackling abuses such as child and forced labour . #% I disagree with Mr Fatuzzo on the Theato report because , as the European Democratic wing of the EPP , as the British Conservatives are , we were completely against the Theato report from start to finish . #% Otherwise , the prospect is that the Middle East Christian community which , at one time , was 20 % of the population , will be driven out completely . #% As you know , over the past two years this House has repeatedly stated in very clear terms its anxiety about the appalling situation in Zimbabwe caused by the Mugabe regime . #% Why did Hussein invoice Iraq 's secret oil sales in euros when he was trying to avoid sanctions ? #% Today , we are actually talking about the design and the content of the coins because they are going to be issued in the very near future . #% That will not help with consumer confidence and might put some of the consumers off if they actually see where the animal was `` slaughtered '' . #% That is why Mr Lannoye 's tenacity in bringing this initiative to Parliament tonight is to be applauded and should be supported by votes tomorrow , as my splendid colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt has urged tonight . #% You might cheer for England , France , Germany or whoever , in other competitions , but the whole of Europe taking on the United States at golf actually brings the people of Europe together on that occasion for two or three days , where everyone is supporting the European team . #% The history of this important project , referred to by a number of you , had its seeds first of all in Professor Monti 's work , for which I pay him tribute , and in a desire by my committee - and I want to thank all the coordinators particularly for the support and energy they put behind this - to say that Parliament needed a response to this as well . #% We would be grateful for the Commission 's view on the issues that we have raised . #% Nonetheless the impression is that our society has become noisier with more machinery , hi-fis and stereos , planes , trains and , above all , motorways . #% It has already happened successfully in mobile telephony ; it is already happening now in the marketplace as new investment is going in . #% The Americans made a start with Project BioShield , and we want to know what the European Union is doing . #% Much more can be achieved by using existing national institutions and an international organisation ... #% It is an attempt to find a common set of criteria , of cost components for the transport infrastructure , and minimising substantial discrepancies across the EU . #% Mr President , I also congratulate our Danish colleagues on the way in which they have handled enlargement . #% Mr President , firstly I want to make it absolutely clear that I have every sympathy with what our rapporteur wishes to achieve in taking forward this proposal . #% I should like to focus on the EU contribution to the Global Health Fund . #% I am concerned at the lack of security and the necessary concentration of ISA forces in Kabul to protect the government . #% There are many opportunities but what of the threats ? #% Do we need to make fishing resources part of the common fisheries policy ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , it has sadly become a characteristic of some of those who speak in support of the European Union to believe that the solution to every problem is more integration . #% But we are also told by Mrs Halunen that she was surprised at the terror that took place after the referendum . #% At this point I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-D√∂rfler , Mrs Redondo Jim√©nez , the Chairman , and the Commission which helped us tremendously in the Foot and Mouth Subcommittee , working with us every single day . #% Compensation for individuals and firms where infringements of EU anti-trust law have taken place will go a long way to dissuading companies and individuals from breaching these laws . #% For example , a thousand people a year - no doubt some of them small children - die in England and Wales while falling downstairs . #% Yesterday I spoke to Mr Patten on this matter and hope there will be some development in this regard involving not only Parliament but the European Union as a whole . #% With codecision , though , it is now Parliament and Council jointly and equally which will decide on what measures to confer upon the Commission and what procedures will be adopted . #% Come and talk to us about the practical things that we are doing and stop complaining in this Chamber about the problems . #% In Europe we have three doctors per 1000 people and , as she has said , we are still short of health professionals . #% We understand that the withdrawal of public aid for fleet modernisation and renewal will not be acceptable to everyone , but we believe that it is only logical in the circumstances . #% We also want to encourage responsible and successful businesses to adopt regulation to help themselves , to look at codes of conduct , to drive out irresponsible businesses . #% Syria 's withdrawal from Lebanon under international pressure has been marred by the arrest of the pro-Syrian security chiefs in connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri , a fierce critic of the Syrian regime . #% I hope I can get a satisfactory answer . #% We are looking for improvement in the management of TACIS and other programmes in the field of nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe . #% Perhaps the Council and the Commission might care to introduce some reforms for future accessions . #% 
A lot of her report deserves applause but she went somewhat awry when she tried to interfere in decisions that were made at Fontainebleau and were incorporated in the own resources decision , a decision which requires unanimity to change it . #% I have time to make only two points . #% In many areas the report adumbrates ideas given wide currency in the Commission 's annual economic report , on which Parliament has already pronounced . #% Not only must we ensure that financial assistance is transparent and can not be used to support terrorism and extremism : there is also a crying need to ensure that our money is used more effectively so that it is of direct benefit to the Palestinian people . #% I work on a ten-year rotation ; plans have to be made far further ahead than for any short-term positions . #% We hope that this report will be a valuable tool in our discussions with the Council and Commission and that other legislation will protect , not undermine , social Europe . #% I am very pleased that India and Pakistan have opened the five crossing points for goods and I hope other crossing points will be opened as well , not just for goods : civilians should also be allowed to cross . #% Hopefully if we can do that , then we will make some progress with the Council and it will be worth going . #% We also have to do something about the way the European Arrest Warrant system operates . #% They are going to oppose the Constitution , indeed , they even announced in the House of Commons that they will use every parliamentary device they can to thwart it . #% When Stalin outlined his project for Central and Eastern Europe , Winston Churchill 's reply was ` the eagle must let the small bird sing ' . #% We were watching , when just last September , political activist Gladys Marin was jailed for five weeks , simply for speaking of Pinochet 's human rights violations . #% The possibility was created for purely political reasons ten years ago and it was a bad idea from the start . #% However , I do want to take this opportunity to mention a couple of areas . #% I urge you , Commissioner , to continue your work on this and not listen to the siren voices in this Chamber tonight that are urging you to stop or slow down . #% While I am always happy to speak on that subject , the main reason that I spoke was to comment on the success of a Labour MEP in having his remarks about having to ring No 10 Downing Street to find out which way to vote expunged from the record . #% But we also need to hold the Saudis to their UN Convention obligations to remove discrimination against women , who can not even drive a car or vote in their limited local elections . #% The British Conservatives support the Commission document on Health and Safety at Work , which talks of the importance of health and safety at work and the need to strengthen the prevention culture and secure a better application of existing law . #% The conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts arose from the attempts of past governments to settle part of their expanding populations in the area in total disregard of the rights of the indigenous people , without respect for the autonomy which they once enjoyed . #% For example , the trainees themselves need preparation , including an awareness of the health and safety risks in a new and unfamiliar environment . #% For the institutions to continue to discharge their obligations successfully they obviously need to continue to attract high-ability , multilingual staff , the majority of whom will spend most of their professional life in a public service outside their home country . #% However , by way of comment , I would just like to say that the reforms we are looking for in the European Union institutions , as the previous speaker said , do not end with looking at the 20 Commissioners . #% France and Germany have alienated America , undermined the UN and NATO and exposed the difficulties of achieving the CFSP . #% We have supported this resolution with the clear aim of sending the message that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs stand side-by-side with the people of Haiti in the long-term work of rebuilding the infrastructure , communities and lives which have been torn apart . #% We should reject the fear stirred up by the likes of Mr Vanhecke just now , by the likes of John Major , by the likes of John Redwood , by the likes of Michael Howard , by the likes of Mr Le Pen , by the likes of William Hague , who would like us to believe that there is a threat to all our countries from over-centralization in Europe . #% Could the Commissioner please tell us in his reply what progress is being made as a result of the pressure that is being applied . #% I was just trying to catch your eye for the next question . #% Our motion recognises that poverty is a fundamental obstacle to the realisation of human rights . #% Why can people here not understand that there is so such thing as a common European culture , no common history and no common heritage , just as there is no common architecture or common language ? #% Through these action programmes we will change young lives , offering hope and options where before there were none . #% Unfortunately , quite often the impact assessments coming forward from the Commission look more like explanatory statements to me rather than comprehensive impact assessments . #% Therefore the heavy metal ban does not solve the problem in the short term . #% What we are doing this evening is commenting on a draft Commission regulation . #% I also urge the Commission to institute fast-track proceedings against the French Government as soon as possible . #% We have two difficulties with paragraph 1 . #% Mr President , in the joint compromise resolution there is a reference to setting a deadline at the end of November for a restoration of democracy . #% I also echo Baroness Ludford 's comments on the British government 's lack of enthusiasm . #% Still today the communities affected lack basic storage containers for clean water , have too few latrines or waterproof shelters and not enough equipment for food preparation or tools to help clear and reconstruct their homes . #% There is also the problem of the illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium poppies for the CIS markets and limited government eradication of illicit narcotic crops . #% It is a damaging policy and I hope the European Parliament will convey that message . #% There is a great and wonderful opportunity in Zimbabwe now with the emergence of the MDC , for all races to work together . #% The House should realise , from the fact that this matter has occupied our Committee for a period of three very long and exhaustive meetings , that it was felt to be a very complex and difficult issue to deal with . #% It would be singularly inappropriate to use this crisis to promote and accelerate the integrationist agenda of the Union , in particular the essentially separatist elements of European defence policy . #% If developing countries are to benefit from trade then the first thing that has to happen , as the report makes very clear , is that developing country producers have to get a fair price for what they produce for their exports , and that those prices reflect the value of their exports . #% I hope that it will be a useful prod for participants at the forthcoming conference , to help bring about the real fundamental changes we need to reform European rural policies . #% Frankly , without a reform of our decision-making structures , enlargement will break the Union -- it is as simple as that . #% I was also disappointed last month by the response of Commissioner de Palacio , whom I normally respect , who was quite dismissive about the code of good administrative behaviour . #% Candidates , tenderers in a procedure , should have access to all the information on all social and employment criteria that they should be taking into account . #% Firstly , it was an abuse of the temporary committee status - Parliament is very fortunate to have this privilege , and I do not think that we should abuse it , especially in the way it was abused with that vote and the final outcome . #% Without dwelling on any particular aspect of the financial services legislation to which this report refers , I have to fulfil my own democratic responsibility and point out that the aggregation of Community legislation is slowly , but inexorably , strangling the financial community and making it almost impossible to trade . #% Unfortunately , the lead committee did not take this on board . #% The British Government squandered a golden opportunity to achieve a fairer distribution of rural development funds and allowed certain Member States , even at that early stage , to allocate for themselves substantial sums of the already reduced amounts . #% I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market . #% The report we have ended up with now is more closely targeted , with an emphasis on social protection and , as the rapporteur has said , a more flexible approach than in earlier reports . #% While India has made the offer to end farm subsidies by 2013 , the US seems hell-bent on increasing agricultural subsidies . #% This report emphasises the role of the Member States and their competences , especially their role in securing jobs leading to economic growth and prosperity . #% . As is explained in the report , there are a few instances in which criminal sanctions are imposed via Community law . #% However , if subordinate bureaucracies will not solve the problems they themselves create , then a solution must be found . #% He has talked about the freedom of movement of workers , in this case , paedophiles and those who have the ability to range across borders and inflict damage on children . #% As my colleague Mr Allister has said , we see it as legal texts that are put into operation . #% Secondly , I should like to endorse the call in the Harrison report to complete the trans-European networks . #% Even if we have previous business , surely voting , which is so important in this House , should always take place punctually , with absolutely no leeway whatsoever . #% Something else has to happen . #% On the services directive , I admit I am unhappy with the Council compromise . #% I would like to commend the President-in-Office for the Council 's support of the Oslo peace process as the way forward . #% To achieve both greater clarity and coherence it is proposed that a joint meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs and the Conference of Presidents should be charged with the task of declaring the hearings closed . #% 
Madam President , I would not want Members of this House to think that I do not have a sense of humour . #% There are serious problems , in particular with preserving freedom of expression . #% Mr President , I am speaking not on behalf of my group or my committee , but on behalf of the British Conservative delegation in the European Democrat pillar within the PPE-DE Group . #% Mr President , the Solidarity Fund was introduced after devastating floods in the summer of 2002 . #% Whilst we welcome the EP 's demand on the importance of launching a wide debate on how to improve our effectiveness in this field , both procedurally and in practice , we nevertheless recognise and respect the significance for Member States in Council of agreeing how best to take this agenda forward . #% But we need to get freight through unfettered . #% I just picked out Portugal and Greece as examples of how tourism activities can be helped . #% Mr President , in my two years in this Parliament I have never received such a barrage of letters of complaint as I have about this report . #% Whilst I accept that the fact that it may dismay such illustrious bodies does not automatically make your proposals wrong , I trust that you would also admit that it does not automatically make them right either . #% Nonetheless the action that she took is perfectly within the realms of democratic expression . #% The very first substantive paragraph underlines the point that we indeed have a European social model which reflects a common set of values based on the preservation of peace , social justice , equality , solidarity , the promotion of freedom and democracy and respect for human rights . #% However , we should not just raise our voices and then carry on as usual . #% The ECR has put forward an amendment which deals with many of the issues created by the full pay compulsory leave clause and I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment and make this report workable . #% Mr President , I ask you to rule it admissible for this debate to now take place , as was the wish of the House earlier in the week . #% Surely this House would have wanted to see a Conservative government returned , and on the basis of fact and realistic policy , people would have wanted to vote Conservative on Thursday last . #% It recognises that this can only be done by economic reform and , as part of the reform programme , it calls upon the Commission to offer stronger leadership to make labour markets more flexible . #% It demonstrates how we can introduce the new technology of genetic modification . #% Mr President , as a Cumbrian - born , bred and resident - and one of the representatives of north-west England , there is nobody in this Parliament who has been more affected by the reverberations arising from recent events at Sellafield than me . #% author . - Madam President , the Liberal Group in the European Parliament has always been supportive of the European Arrest Warrant because of its importance in the fight against serious cross-border crime . #% We need clear guidelines that everyone can have confidence in . #% It will help the victims of motor accidents that occur outside the victim 's home country in another Member State . #% Resolution 687 had an overall objective of restoring international peace and security in the region . #% It highlights an issue that the citizens around the European Union are not even aware of , despite the fact that what the Commissioner says is absolutely true . #% One wonders how long we will have to keep printing new seating orders . #% Finally , I do not think she is often quoted in this House , but I want to quote Madonna - that is the pop star . #% Nor is it appropriate in the context of the ongoing discussions over Lamfalussy . #% Parliament can only be satisfied on those issues , however , when we see the additional legislation and flanking measures which I understand are now in preparation within the Commission . #% However , we still have a concern that the Commission should present a coherent approach . #% Mr President , as others have said , many promises have been made on debt relief but in fact very few have been delivered . #% We have a third step forward and that is a guarantee in case all this does not work . #% I had to intervene on behalf of several passengers because they were told that they would not get overnight accommodation , for instance . #% This power is rarely used , but we must reserve the right to use it for serious breaches of public security . #% Mr President , I rise to speak specifically and directly in response to Sir Neil MacCormick 's report on tripartite contracts . #% I regret that Mr Alyssandrakis has taken fright at my reference to military applications . #% I have seen year after year the steady drainage , the reduction of the water , and the fact now that over half a million marsh dwellers , reaching right back beyond the beginnings of civilisation of our world , have now had their livelihood , their lives destroyed , their place removed from under their feet by the Iraqi marsh drainage . #% I have a particular direct question to put to the Commissioner on the limit values which have been set by the Commission at 1 ppm . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner the following points . #% As the Commissioner has said , they are the cornerstone of the governance of the revised common fisheries policy . #% All this sits rather uneasily with endless lists . #% Will he therefore reaffirm our determination , not only to ask for the World Trade Organization panel to be reconstituted if required , but to take whatever other steps are necessary to prevent the extra-territorial provisions of the Helms/Burton Act being exercised in any way against our traders . #% With enlargement the Atlanticist cause will be strengthened . #% State aid for employment , where it is permitted , as appropriate , by this regulation , can never actually solve Europe 's unemployment problems . #% This report was voted on under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure , which allows for no debate and no amendments to the report . #% I have one concern , namely that we are trying to set too strict values . #% The Commissioner and you , Mr President , are laughing . #% There has been considerable difficulty in reconciling national traditions and exceptions . #% It seems to me the worst sort of appeasement to say that if the international community has not acted in one case it should not act in any other . #% The simple decision to buy products with a Fair Trade mark can have a huge impact , guaranteeing that growers and workers benefit from fairer wages and better working conditions , and can make a crucial different to their ability to provide for the basic needs of their families . #% It is very important , therefore , to monitor production in the countries from which we import organic produce . #% Genetic modification of plants and seeds holds out the possibility of better food production in harsh climates and of assuring future food supplies to a fast-growing world population . #% P [ amp ] O Ferries , operating on the Dover-Calais route , have two identical ships operating , one with the abatement technology and one without . #% If we are serious about trying to control the production of ` greenhouse ' gases we must ensure that these costs are factored in on each and every occasion . #% The Americans need to learn from this crisis that security is not just a matter of power projection . #% This is with a view , by the summer break , to compiling finalised proposals either for Commission decisions - which have the force of law - or proposals to this House and the Council where amendments to the Staff Regulations are required . #% Madam President , when we came in this morning there was a distinct smell of cigars in this Chamber . #% I am afraid that in this case free trade means that those countries are free to see their economies and their democracies actually collapse . #% We have now reached the point where we have in front of us the common position . #% The agreement will only act as a substitute for the trade provisions of existing bilateral maritime agreements . #% I have no doubt this is true in each country of the European Union but I , as a British Member , am happy to pay tribute to the very high standards and the leadership that the BBC has given in public service broadcasting . #% One thing we have to make very clear is that , contrary to accepted beliefs , if you are involved in an air crash the likelihood is that you will not actually die . #% It also follows that debt reduction can only contribute to achieving the millennium development goals if it takes place under good governance . #% Perhaps Minister Roche could explain . #% This is probably the last time I will address this Parliament as chairman of the Committee on Budgets . #% Is that going to be a sustainable message to give them when they want to make a living for themselves ? #% Finally , I would like to think that with Amendment No 17 which calls for prior recourse to other established means of dealing with complaints that we have to have here a system which is absolutely clear . #% This operation is proceeding on my own farm at this very moment , and the machinery is reliable . #% 
I do not entirely agree , although I believe that any further enlargement will be unacceptable to the people of Europe for some significant time while we assimilate and integrate the twelve new Member States from 2004 and after . #% Last March Parliament was quite correct to defer discharge and gave five reasons for doing so . #% I found the President-in-Office 's reply very helpful and encouraging as far as it goes , but it does not fully address some of the points that are made in this question . #% Mr Barroso , you say that it is impossible to change the portfolio at this stage . #% My understanding is that there has been some expression of regret and contrition on the part of the utilities in Germany and the transport organization . #% We all , I am sure , have letters saying that these regulations are impracticable , cumbersome , costly and far too complex . #% We would like people to look into that please . #% It was a very useful exercise , because it has shown the extent of the problems with the Community patent proposals . #% We are gathered here with a reasonable unanimity in the committee , with a very modest number of amendments but with an absolute certainty that we want to press our point . #% Eighty-two per cent of disabled people live below the poverty line in developing countries . #% This framework decision if implemented also challenges traditional values of free speech and this is harmful , not helpful , to good race relations , which we all desire . #% There is little to say except that everything seems to be going well in the sense that our citizens are more aware of the Ombudsman 's activities . #% Let us not underestimate it . #% We have an international agreement under MARPOL Annex VI to reduce the sulphur content in sensitive sea areas to 1.5 % in the Channel , the North Sea and the Baltic . #% I say to them : nice try on April Fool 's Day but we look forward to receiving the genuine report on what should be made available for the conversion of those buildings . #% You mentioned the need to ratify any change to this system . #% As Greens , we think there are some services , particularly those dealing with the general public interest , which are too sensitive and too potentially vulnerable to be negotiated under this ` negative list ' approach . #% The move towards digital convergence has meant that many technologies now use the same sort of communications methods , and for that reason much of what we are discussing today will have an impact going beyond the issue of delivery of satellites into space and what they can be used for - particularly military aspects , but also the development of peaceful aspects and , in particular , the development of the information society . #% The worry is that when the EU gets involved it inevitably screws up . #% Mr President , I endorse the fact that this budget for Parliament and the other institutions is indeed a very important matter . #% In the words of the UK Health and Safety Executive , the body set up to give the UK Government the expert and impartial scientific advice so necessary when dealing with such issues , these amendments provide `` no benefit for health and safety and their sole effect will be to place unnecessary and unwelcome burdens on industry , particularly on small firms '' . #% I hope and I know that there are those who have this ambition that all institutions can emulate that practice and do so with great rapidity . #% I hope the European Union will help Bill Clinton to understand that fact . #% They concern problems arising from the 2002 reference period in the Commission 's report . #% People have memories and while we accept that 2 to 3 % growth will take place , it is not near enough to the 4 % that the US has consistently experienced to create the millions of jobs that it has to . #% Mr President , as you said , this report - on an ` open-coordination-method ' common asylum policy and internal security - covers two methods . #% I am sure the Commission recognises this . #% It supported us at the time and there was much talk of mainstreaming the results into the ESF , ERDF and relevant programmes . #% Would you support my view that , in order to protect the European Development Fund , we should ringfence EDF money when it is budgetised in the way that we have suggested , to ensure that it is protected for ACP countries and does not slip into other areas of the world ? #% That has not always been the case on a global scale . #% The committee has worked hard to ensure that . #% If there is to be true reconciliation between these peoples , then complete objectivity is needed and in this report before us that is too sadly lacking . #% But when the ad hoc delegation went to Serbia earlier this year , and we were discussing this with the World Bank , they made the point that they would be looking at the supply side to see what the needs of Serbia were . #% Of course , there are concerns about the social effects of gambling and these are concerns that I share . #% His place of detention is not known and his family is being put under terrible pressure . #% Should there be a train crash in Cyprus there would be two trains involved . #% For a start , it goes to the heart of problems that many small businesses are experiencing in an economy in which they are finding conditions very difficult at the moment . #% I thank the Commissioner for her statement and I commend the resolution to the House . #% I invite the Council in its response this afternoon to say that it will submit its own annual human rights report to this Parliament so that this report next year can be a response to it . #% That is a failure of the Member States , often supported by sections of the railway industry and , frankly , Parliament 's patience is beginning to run out . #% Some of that is understandable : we are operating in the most sensitive area of national sovereignty ; it has been difficult to bring together nation states with different interests and practices and clearly we have had to walk before we could run . #% We must have the guts to pay for our freedoms and defend them . #% However , we do not support the proposition that ` combating international terrorism implies a distinct strengthening of the relevant EU competencies ' , or that the EU should have responsibility for negotiating agreements on judicial and police cooperation with the US , which are properly a national responsibility , given the very different constitutional , judicial and operational traditions of key Member States such as the United Kingdom . #% Europe needs to demonstrate clearly and unambiguously that it has learned some lessons from the votes on that . #% What powers would he or she have ? #% But we could not agree with the rapporteur that the human rights clause in the FTA with Colombia was satisfactory . #% Thankfully the plenary , in its wisdom , has now overturned the view of our Liberal rapporteur and removed the problems that I have alluded to . #% The removal of Member States ' ability to set an upper level on the amount of outstanding pay claims to be guaranteed would go well beyond the aim of providing a minimum standard of protection to safeguard the vulnerable . #% Now , in many - in fact , I would say in most - things , we have had a mutually supportive dialogue , Commissioner , though of course we have not agreed on everything . #% This would be confusing for the public . #% I know this House will share my sense of sorrow and grief at such a tragic loss of life , and I would be grateful , Mr President , if you could pass on to the school the condolences of all in this Parliament . #% I join colleagues in urging the Commission to accede to our views . #% It has been very easy for the KLA to provoke the Serbian forces into inappropriate responses in order to win international sympathy . #% That is essential for our Union to work effectively . #% Mr President , I am pleased to see Commissioner Fischler here , but some of the comments I have to make will also refer to Commissioner Byrne 's portfolio . #% We want that to apply both to the specific Community provisions referred to here and to all other alcoholic beverages . #% I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question . #% I feel it is important to protect consumers and to put a greater focus on strengthening market surveillance , so that products destined for citizens meet the highest standards possible . #% Transferring huge amounts of money between budget lines , which does not reflect Parliament 's considered political view at the time of the budget process , is a worrying development that is happening more and more . #% There should be absolutely no ambiguity about our message . #% I would like to welcome this communication from the Commission which provides the necessary clarity on these issues and a real focus on how the European Union should proceed and probably do these things better in the future . #% As regards Mr Tannock 's question , I will find out what I can and inform him and the House . #% It is time we had a level playing field . #% I , for one , will be prepared to make that judgement , and I intend to lead a team of observers committed to ensuring that the European Union takes an independent and fair position on these elections . #% There is time . #% It was unfortunate that this morning we were unable to hear from the Commissioner as fully as we would have liked on the proposals concerning voice telephony . #% 
The timing of the ban was debated at length prior to the Environmental Council in June 2005 , and the 2011 date was agreed in the Council conclusions as contained in the Commission 's proposal . #% Education and training are also the key to integration . #% We would like a full explanation of that , but it makes sense to have it from the Council , which carried out this decision , rather than from the Commission , which was , I suppose , only a spectator . #% This is what this motion is about and I very much hope Members will support it . #% None do any good . #% Moreover I believe our hearings went some way to assuage the appearance of uncertainty which characterised the meeting of the Council in Brussels the weekend before , where the eventual choice of Duisenberg and Trichet for a 12-year incumbency of the ECB governorship was a success but the nature of the deal which buttressed it left something to be desired . #% It is not whether there is a common foreign and security policy worth its name that exercises my constituents , it is whether or not we are able to achieve peace and stability on the European continent . #% That is welcome , but I believe we need to do much more in the future . #% These proposals are realistic and cautiously ambitious , they improve to my mind on the Commission 's draft proposals . #% My criticism of the report from the Commission is that it does little in the form of positive policy support for the strengthening of internal demand . #% There will also have to be closer institutional links in place of the ad hoc arrangements which exist today . #% I would particularly commend the remarks by Mrs D√ºhrkop D√ºhrkop , and the Commission must get the legal base in order so that those funds can be paid next year promptly and on time . #% Even though this is an internal directive , it can not be taken in isolation , just as the EU can not be taken in isolation . #% While we are fully supportive of the efforts of the President of the Commission and some Member States to reduce burdens on business and impediments to job creation , we are concerned that some of the measures outlined in the resolution could lead to higher costs on business and detract from the over-riding priority of making Europe more competitive in the global market place and thus significantly reducing unemployment levels . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Schwaiger . #% But what is the Council if it is not the Member States ? #% Ignorance of the way in which the European Union works , coupled with the failure of national parliaments to oversee and scrutinise European matters properly , are two of the great weaknesses in the European political structure as it has developed . #% It may happen long after we have left , but I am sure it will eventually sink into the mire it was built upon . #% Mr President , does the consultation process which was used by Member States reflect the public 's confidence that they will have a decent pension at the end of their working lives , given the current state of the finances and markets of the Member States ? #% In the light of that it would be sensible to take time until Strasbourg . #% Please ensure in the fifth framework programme that a way is found to help research into diabetes . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to apologise to the rapporteur that I was unable to be here at the beginning . #% Well , the Israelis have not quite stopped building their security wall , stealing Palestinian land and water . #% Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date , or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level . #% The original Article 25 would have severely damaged liquidity and liquidity is vital for the health of our markets and our economy . #% The first one is the demise of the Cold War and the second is the advent of the CFSP . #% In traditional own-resources we see evidence of the difficulty of collection and the propensity to fraud . #% Organised crime and corruption still flourish and the judiciary is too often manipulated by politicians . #% If we are to deal with car manufacturers , we have got to set mandatory limits on CO2 limits ; we have to have smaller cars . #% It was therefore right , in legal terms and for practical purposes . #% So you ought to be clear about what the Foreign Secretary said . #% I hope the Commission and Council listen to the view of the Parliament on this issue . #% I regularly see reports in the press of exciting new therapies and developments in this field , but usually they are in the USA and not in Europe , which is to our loss . #% We prefer the emphasis in paragraph 6 because it draws attention to the fundamental fact , highlighted recently by a study from the Centre for Economic Policy Research , that the greatest instrument to alleviate poverty is the further liberalisation of agriculture . #% I appreciate the action of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten in bringing forward the proposed new Article 55 , which is supported by many political groups . #% We must ensure that co-incineration does not undermine the economics of the industry and essentially stop the working , or close down the working , of dedicated hazardous waste incinerators whose use is absolutely essential for some forms of waste . #% Let me turn to one of the main preoccupations of the Committee on Petitions . #% Poverty eradication must , she says , be the overriding goal and should of course run through the entire agreement , including the trade section . #% Mistaken identity and identity theft mean that what has happened to Jason and Michael can now also happen to any British citizen at any time . #% Many of us are working with that in mind . #% I also accept some of the analysis of Mr Garriga Polledo in terms of the fact that the international monetary system needs rules . #% The Commission and the Member States await the outcome and the opinion of the Scientific Committee , before taking the adequate measures to restrict the use of soft PVC in toys . #% It makes no sense for us to repeat the exercise , but equally it would make no sense for us not to take account of these findings . #% We are very close to an understanding which will ensure that Parliament and Commission move forward together . #% This is a huge scientific report and the US response is entirely untenable . #% In this conflict , far too many people have died . #% It is now quite clear that the prospectus directive will not prevent Member States from imposing the high corporate government standards that exist in many places , for example in the United Kingdom . #% I am sure that with Commissioner Reding and her team future Commission activity in response to the increased priority for education agreed at the Lisbon and Stockholm Summits will be better than that detailed in my report . #% Of course , as the Europeans are not proposing any additional forces , the capacity for EU autonomous action refers primarily to the political decision-making process . #% We voted against the references to the Lisbon Treaty in line with our long-standing policy of opposing it . #% The new Presidency wants to develop a transparent and effective Union . #% It is a scandal that , in the interests of land management , American multi-millionaires can shoot elephants that need to be culled , whilst people of African origin are not allowed to buy and consume bushmeat in a managed trade . #% However , our lives are not dependent on them , whereas quality of interpretation can be absolutely crucial to an asylum seeker 's future . #% As many colleagues are aware , I have a specific interest in working with the disability movement . #% I am quite prepared to believe that 15 heads , or 15 sets of data across the Union , will help us achieve better quality in the schools . #% I hope the Commission will take up this suggestion . #% We also know that there are increasing rates of asthma , cancer and other diseases which probably originate from chemicals . #% It certainly makes sense for two or three incoming Presidencies to get together to agree priorities and to pursue plans based on a longer-term programme . #% Finally , just one last appeal regarding distinguishing signs . #% But , still , the new bosses would not listen to the people . #% In Belgrade , the police stand by and watch as hooligans attack lesbians and gay people at their gay pride celebration only days after millions of EU dollars were committed to that region and Milosevic was sent to The Hague . #% Corruption undermines economic progress . #% But the safe passage is physically just a narrow corridor through which freedom of movement , a central tenet of European Union philosophy , is hedged about with many necessary security constrictions . #% I am afraid the wrong message comes from this report . #% I entirely agree with Mr Swoboda . #% A hierarchy of oppression is perpetuated by legislative inaction and democratic inaction . #% 
There is a very real risk that excessive pressure on vulnerable , energy-intensive industries could lead to a loosening of the overall cap . #% Sub-Saharan Africa has some 750 000 health workers for 682 million people . #% Realistically , I am particularly worried that it poses questions about OLAF 's independence ; it is part of the Commission in this process and we can amend its budget in that way . #% It is a very useful document and it deals both with the primary and the secondary elements . #% Mr President , I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general . #% The ` Everything But Arms ' initiative shows that the EU can do good , but we can and must do better before the US mandate expires and , with it , our opportunity to eradicate poverty and distribute fairly the benefits of globalisation . #% I hope the Commission will be able to work with Parliament and the Council in order to ensure an on-going process . #% For those of you here who have only just emerged from police states , this may not be very significant , but such immunity for law-enforcement officers is a concept alien to English law . #% I believe that there is a common understanding here of the necessity to observe human rights and of the need for cooperation between our two states in the European Union , as well as for respect for the independence of the judiciary . #% It is all about the industry understanding what its future will be and then private investment will come into the industry . #% British Conservatives supported the Swoboda report but voted against amendments relating to Recital G. Conservatives are strong supporters of enlargement of the EU , in particular to include Croatia , which will be a relatively smooth process , but are strongly opposed to the idea that a Constitution is a requirement for further enlargement as stated in Recital G. #% Mr President , I would like to draw attention to the seriousness of the situation around Calais following the second refusal by French courts last Friday to close the Sangatte refugee transit centre . #% But in any case even if were not at such a juncture , respect of the treaties is fundamental . #% It must involve the Member States as well as the Commission , and we look forward to initiatives on both sides in that regard . #% That hardly constitutes a point of order . #% Our intention was to amend as well the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feedingstuff to be indicated with a declaration of percentage by weight . #% We are going to be increasingly faced with hard decisions on this . #% These are statistics gathered by industry groups and others and not because of equipment failure . #% I shall pick out one or two of the more important ones . #% I speak as Parliament 's rapporteur on the 1996 annual economic report and on the broad economic guidelines . #% Now the amendment alone can not solve the problem that generic drugs still available now are not affordable , but it will establish in TRIPs that production for export legitimately comes under compulsory licensing and so also loosens the constraint of the legitimate interests of the patent owner , at least as regards territory , in other articles . #% Despite huge human rights concerns and EU influence in the Middle East , human rights clauses have never been invoked in relations with Egypt , Israel or Tunisia , in the latter case despite strong EU statements last year on curbs on freedom of expression and the blocking of NGO funding . #% I wish to thank my colleagues -- there were 28 of us , the largest ever delegation of the European Parliament -- the vice-chairman , Mrs Napoletano , and the staff who accompanied us and prepared the observation mission . #% I have great respect for the rapporteur , who is a truly nice man and has helped me on many occasions . #% The cause is good . #% I should like to ask him two supplementary questions . #% I do not want to underestimate the strength of feeling among many Tamil citizens , in particular , that they were not getting a fair deal , but we can be certain that terrorism has not improved their opportunities one iota . #% I praise everyone involved , particularly the rapporteurs , on a very successful budget outcome . #% Conservative MEPs condemned the December 2005 agreement and therefore can not support proposals originating from it . #% For these reasons British Conservatives voted against the resolution . #% I have to say , however , that he produced good work despite , rather than because of , the help of his own group . #% I have the document of this report in which it says that the committee voted it . #% We feel that particularly due to the killing of the British backpacker Jeremy Parks on 28 October . #% Finally , we have to recognise the real difficulties of applying these new proposals in every circumstance and on every application that we find in the vast array of options inside the European Union . #% You have our full backing on everything you have done in getting better information on implementation for us so far . #% It is a totally unnecessary intrusion into the freedoms of millions of people . #% Perhaps the involvement of Turkey 's troops under French command in Lebanon will prove to be a turning point in the life of CFSP and a welcome sign of things to come . #% We have seen the introduction of denied boarding compensation - although we know there are still issues to resolve with that . #% That , rather than a concentration on the concerns of the financial institutions , should be our proper starting point . #% I am not one of those Members who is opposed to nuclear power per se but I accept that if there is to be nuclear power there is no room for a single mistake . #% Mr President , in the course of this decade we have seen a shift in the emphasis as far as global development priorities are concerned . #% Abroad and inside the Union , people will soon see a more effective , efficient and democratic Union . #% Many positive changes have taken place since that time , not least since the new Commission took over . #% More people have died in Teddy Kennedy 's car than have died of phthalates ! #% In all these cases , I believe that freedom of speech should be paramount , and that criminal law should only be brought in when there is clear incitement to hatred , to violence or to terrorism . #% So what can we do to bring long-term stability to this volatile region ? #% It is for Egypt to show us here in this House , that it takes the rights of their minorities seriously , to call for an end to discrimination against those minorities and to release from prison and end immediately the investigations and the arrests of gay men throughout Egypt which worry us here in this House . #% I should like to draw to your attention two points for you to reflect on . #% Fish stocks are a truly natural resource and should be renewable for all time . #% It simply encapsulates a lot of what Member States are already doing . #% Over the last few years we have seen , at least in Western Europe , the levels of phosphate in drinking water fall by between 50 % and 80 % . #% Compare that with these proposals . #% It is just so blatantly unlikely . #% Nevertheless , we need time and we will do the job . #% Let us also work hard to bring China and other such countries into the scope of an international treaty . #% For the next plenary we might have to consider how to respond to the inadequacy of the responses . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I am not sure that inspiration is going to be what is on offer but this is obviously a very controversial topic that many Members in this House were terrified to come and speak about , so those of us who are brave enough to be here must seize the moment . #% The excessive proliferation of sites and the probable duplication of the UNESCO scheme are also likely to add problems . #% Top ten rankings may also differ in neighbouring countries . #% We have overtly encouraged this within our own borders through the principle of free movement . #% But if anyone going away from this House this week , Member , staff or visitor , has symptoms , then those that run this House will be guilty of having let us come here this week and it will be their responsibility . #% The large number of amendments which we shall put forward today in blocked groups reflects the degree of consensus that we ourselves reached . #% Does he think that by removing a substantial number of contracts from the public procurement regime , by raising thresholds , he is going to improve the situation for SMEs ? #% We have a bad international situation and again the report mentions the prospects of the Union having an adequate policy mix . #% The European Union has already been responsible for the closure of many slaughterhouses and , in fact , in many cases , there would be no space for separate sewage treatment facilities . #% I am also grateful , at the risk of being repetitive , to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which , if she will allow me to say so , she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating . #% 
in writing . - The reason for this statement and next month 's resolution is the appalling situation regarding Airbus in Europe . #% When implemented , the measures we propose will recognise and respect certain basic civil liberties . #% Ghana , of course , is talking about the high tariffs that have to be paid when an attempt is made to introduce processed coffee into the European Union . #% That was not received , though a promise was received from the Commission , dated 18 November , that information would be received by 15 December . #% It is hard to imagine that , in the short period of 15 years , Lithuania has managed to join the EU . #% I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given . #% At the moment the amendment would include the words ` including eventually NOx emissions ' , but I would like to remove the word ` eventually ' . #% Perhaps we ought to start off by reminding ourselves of the very reason why this report came about in the first place . #% The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted for this resolution , despite its opposition both to paragraph 8 and to the amendments to it . #% However , we voted in favour of my Amendment No 23 , calling for a thorough Business Impact Assessment to be carried out and published within three years of the adoption of this Directive . #% Mr President , in the light of some of the matters that have been discussed in this debate , I have to keep reminding myself that this is the first reading . #% However , the Barroso Commission supports ratification of the EU Constitution , and my party , the British Conservatives , oppose ratification and believe that the Constitution is inimical to the interests of the British people . #% The United Kingdom has one of the most effective systems of democratic oversight , both political and judicial , of its intelligence services in the world . #% I thought I was clear enough . #% As much as anything , it is about getting the Member States to realize that subsidiarity is not always about moving things down a level , it is about doing things at the right level . #% Madam President , clearly the House will want to make its own decision on this very important issue but I should like to stress that at no point has the British Government not accepted that this is a crisis facing not just British farming and rural communities but potentially the whole of the farming industry in the European Union . #% It seems to me that many of those comments have been unfair and misleading . #% Feed was contaminated in the mills , in the transport system or on farms containing different classes of livestock . #% I am alarmed at the anti-United States rhetoric which we have heard from a number of speakers , and at some of the other outbursts from other Members . #% The backlash could create a whole new cause c√©l√®bre for terrorism . #% In fact there are a number of applications where no alternative is possible , for example fire protection and the use of sulphur hexafluoride in switch gear . #% Will the Council be considering this at the meeting to which he referred in March ? #% Many of these deaths and illnesses arise from ignorance and the taking of unacceptable risks . #% Those tensions will get more -- not less -- significant with the expansion of the eurozone and with the enlargement of the European Union . #% It should also monitor fair distribution of the money . #% We do not need this report either to remind us of them or to attempt to push the agenda into areas which are likely to be of great controversy and are likely to achieve counterproductive results instead of an enhancement of human rights already determined . #% PNR is an important weapon in ensuring we protect ourselves against such terrorism , but it is not the only weapon : pragmatism and proportionality should be key to every decision we make in this House ; the subject of passenger name records is no different . #% Mr President , in the budget there is a whole title devoted to agriculture and rural development which indeed gobbles up half the available EU money , but there is no heading for urban support , despite the fact that , as Mr Beaupuy 's report reminds us , four-fifths of Europeans live in towns and cities . #% The technologies that we are speaking about are critical to the success or failure of key European industries into the next century . #% As you know I have just presented my report which Parliament kindly voted on this morning . #% I am sorry , Commissioner , that your colleague , Commissioner Bolkestein is not here . #% Would the President-in-Office comment on our contacts with both parties ? #% That is why I think it is now time for us to hear of the ambitions and interests of the European Court of Justice , how it defines its role for the future and how it does so with a minimum of inconvenience and conflict with the nation-state courts themselves . #% We are in a time when the multilateral system is in crisis . #% Our common goal is to promote and protect the health of individuals and our populations . #% The two roles are therefore complementary , and care should be taken in the Treaty to distinguish these two roles . #% Mr Erdogan , Mr Simitis , Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash must now prepare themselves to take a dramatic step towards integration and reconciliation and reject partition and revenge . #% Oddly enough I have not received many e-mails , so my machine has not been stuffed full of e-mails from Doctor Rath or anybody else . #% Is he aware that many of the statistics claimed for job losses and air traffic increases are highly speculative and that the reality is that it is a taxpayers ' subsidy to the traveller ? #% I am very interested in the statement the Commissioner made . #% Some of that money could be better spent in arming our forces in Afghanistan , forces that actually train the Afghan police force , etc. . #% The Council is not doing terribly well , is it ? #% The admired Socialist philosopher Aneurin Bevan said that each freedom is only made safe by adding another to it . #% There is no such reference in the current Treaties , although they were drafted by Saint Schuman . #% Mr Assange remained in Sweden for five weeks to answer the allegations , but he was not questioned as the investigation was unduly delayed . #% Amendment 37 was listed as , ` Proposal to reject the Commission proposal ' . #% I think the Canadians have had a very hard experience in fish management and have probably learnt their lesson . #% The proposals for reforming the civil service and for tackling corruption are also an essential basis for political and economic change . #% There is a great deal of fear in the European economy at present , fear of job losses , fear of what will happen in old age , fear of what will happen if people have periods of sickness , fear of what will happen to children . #% I hope it will be possible to maintain this original proposal from Mr Manzella . #% I therefore wish profoundly to retain that target date in Parliament 's report . #% Georgia , Armenia and Azerbaijan sit between the Caspian and Black Seas , with both Iran , Turkey and Russia as near neighbours . #% I was privileged also to represent Parliament in East Timor , where I witnessed at first hand Sergio Vieira de Mello 's successful efforts in rebuilding a whole country -- a talent so tragically lost to us . #% The level of the European Union budget , at just over 1 % of Europe 's GDP , is about right . #% I wonder whether it would not have been wiser to have carried out an assessment of the economic impact on small clubs before you travelled down this road . #% One of the saddest days of my life was when I went to the Longbridge car plant to meet the receiver of that plant , which had gone bankrupt . #% I invite the Commission tonight to join with me in putting safety first by supporting our amendment . #% That is when secrecy and cover-up begin . #% Essentially , the number of plastic objects which could be put in the mouth and swallowed is increasing . #% As regards the critical issue here , which is the extension of this ban to products , the Socialist Group fully supports the second amendment which proposes this idea . #% I am disappointed it was not accepted . #% This meeting was symbolic of the deep bond between Britain and Poland . #% This paper is an excellent step forward . #% What we are considering is vesting even more powers in the hands of the EU and the unelected bureaucrats to take control of our very liberties - the body which brought us the inestimable benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy . #% Surely it is desirable that the Union avoids putting itself inside such a straitjacket . #% Will he give special emphasis to ensuring a timely entry into negotiations for Turkey , since so much hangs in the balance in early October on reforms in Turkey ? #% 
Why this lack of enthusiasm for the EU ? #% I thank all those Members - none of whom have turned up - for their contributions . #% It is essential that the British Presidency gives a great impetus to the campaign of informing citizens across the European Union that this is their project , not only the project of politicians , and that it is something important to their lives . #% The Commission will of course take the satisfactory implementation of the association agreement into account when it decides on the allocation of future funds . #% When we talk of a policy on Iraq , Commissioner Patten spoke about the recklessness of the Iraq regime . #% I regret any misunderstanding and extend all my sympathies to those who have suffered , irrespective of race or religion . #% I hope that these will have the full support of this House and that we will begin to end the ` ping pong ' game that we play with the human rights and civil liberties of ordinary men and women . #% The third principle we support is liberalisation but not privatisation ; and fourth and finally we want to see these proposals developed in conjunction with the proposed European Aviation Safety Authority . #% Local authorities can then , in the light of that information , take the appropriate action in the event of any incident . #% If they opted in to get mailings from subversive political movements they could find themselves attracting unwarranted surveillance from the police , for instance . #% I think the time has come when the City of London and Britain 's financial markets are going to rise up against membership of this European Union . #% The petitioners are not questioning this Parliament about the present regime , which the Commissioner now thinks may be satisfactory . #% The financing costs issue - the third point raised by Mr Collins - is central to the project development . #% In conclusion , this is an excellent report . #% Mr President , I know that many Members have very important commitments back in their constituencies and regions , and maybe even more important appointments back at the airport . #% It will require imagination , sensitivity , goodwill and , above all , honesty of political approach . #% In heading 5 , one of the main areas where we differ is in our support for the Commission on the reform programme , especially on the establishment plan and the posts that are needed . #% If we do not find that additional amendments have been tabled or if they are withdrawn , I would ask you , Mr President , to use your good offices to have this added to the voting list tomorrow lunchtime . #% I personally believe it is best for outsiders , including Members of this House , not to put any pressure on a referendum process as this would be perceived as interference in Cyprus 's sovereign affairs . #% I am not sure she has the full backing of the college . #% I rise as a member of the Mashrek Delegation , to mention to the House that since the last part-session there has been an announcement by His Majesty , the King of Bahrain , that the national parliament , which was suspended in 1975 , will at last be reconvened later this year . #% It is a loophole which Parliament , with the assistance of the Commission , is seeking to close . #% We have met the anxieties both of those who felt that traditional measurements might be eliminated - and plainly they will not - in the various Member States and of those small shopkeepers who felt that they would be forced into a system for which they were not prepared . #% In particular , the provisions on material holdings are unduly harsh and would unduly restrict banks and insurance companies in investing in a range of equities . #% Therefore , I hope that this morning we will recommit ourselves to both ensuring that the budget for the current structural fund programme is fully committed in the 1999 budget , fully honouring the Edinburgh Agreement , and that everything possible is done to ensure that the new programming period from 2000 onwards starts on time . #% We are now told , for example , that teachers must be protected from noisy children . #% Such a similar result will only come out of this European Convention , if we as a Parliament are bold , well-organised and persuasive . #% But Parliament is not yet a full partner and that must be our goal over the next few years . #% We have some way to go in the search for capacity , independence and integrity , but of one thing I am sure , and that is that corporate governance principles play a part , be it in the public or private sector , and that should apply to ESMA and the other ESAs too . #% Mr Wynn asked what the purpose of this amendment was . #% It is called ` Europe Needs an FBI ' . #% As the Commissioner knows , wrongly used the Stability Pact could be highly deflationary , reduce growth and add to unemployment . #% The basic crisis has been with us for many years and it will be with us for many years more unless we do something radical about it . #% I hope Parliament will fully endorse what is proposed here . #% As I said , I shall expect a better answer than I got yesterday , which was dreadful . #% In addition , we have far more of a tradition of parliamentary scrutiny . #% I shall turn now to the broad principles of the action plan we are deliberating . #% In the car industry of the past , all of the research and development , many of the components and so forth , were dealt with by the core company themselves . #% In this world the bureaucrat most certainly is king . #% Reassurances of strong safeguards for Slav minorities must be given , probably along with a form of devolved government to the territory , which , after all , has never been part of historic Bessarabia or been Romanian speaking and which Stalin annexed cruelly to create Moldova 60 years ago . #% I agree with the Commissioner when he says that we must go for only one-year quotas . #% Finally , entrepreneurs in the travel and tourism industry will make Europe 's top industry more competitive , as the transparency of the euro will drive down costs . #% Please also give your encouragement and support to their activities in diversifying local economies , in contributing to the development of the common fisheries policy and in providing a coordinated approach to tackling issues of common concern . #% What representations are being made to the Government of South Africa to apply greater regional pressure on the Mugabe government ? #% There was one main weakness , however , in that proposal , which is that there was no provision for the selling off of tyres that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date . #% Mr President , I did not receive a clear answer from the Council . #% The CFP has been an unmitigated environmental disaster . #% We have had many examples brought to us in the recent past of jeans and other domestic commodities which trade on a remarkably similar name . #% That would speed up our reaction and help us on a Union basis . #% The rapporteur 's proposal that there should be very clear definitions as to when such products should be allowed for use , should be supported . #% While there are serious issues that are not entirely resolved here , if we want to have a healthy European future and a healthy European project , we depend on such initiatives to take this forward . #% Mention must be made at the determination of those involved , including David Trimble , and not least a Member of this House , John Hume , who has fought for peace for over three decades . #% How can he sell that to the people of Europe ? #% For example , there are more people with epilepsy than with Aids - 40 million people live with it , but only 8 million of those 40 million are treated for it . #% Again , we wish to see some flesh put on those particular commitments as soon as possible , preferably again under your leadership and presidency . #% Mr President , this is refreshing - the fact that the European Union is acknowledging that there are problems but that we have solutions . #% Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September . #% You said the Council is looking closely at this , but that does not help . #% I ask the Commission to review them now . #% I hope that when we look at the review that is taking place in the Council at the moment , we will all be able to contribute in a way that will curb the arms trade and enable more money to be made available for development . #% You are ignoring all these things ; in fact , you are developing a bunker mentality , and perhaps that is a good thing , because at least it shows that the end is in sight ! #% We have asked for intervention . #% It is therefore a matter of urgency . #% We must , therefore , make sure not only that we get proper coherence between the agencies working on the ground but also Madam President-of-the Council , that we do not take decisions which mean that we are spending money futilely because of a Council decision that we must have some people removed some 100 miles away in another place . #% No , it is not ` failure ' - although it could be . #% I disagree , to an extent , with Mr Krarup , in that this is an issue that no one country can address on its own . #% 
You can not have the one without the other . #% Secondly , these committees set up by the Council or the Member States had the right to block an implementing measure from the Commission and refer them back , but Parliament had no such right . #% I deeply regret Parliament 's unwillingness to really open up access to such decisions to the widest possible number of people . #% I would ask you and other Members to bear in mind , when considering this issue and when it comes for debate that , although Gibraltar is part of the European Union , the residents of Gibraltar do not themselves have direct representation in this Parliament . #% I think it would be of great service to the House if he could indicate the state of this proposal at the moment . #% Democratic rights in Turkey #% Instead let us agree that ICT holds out great promise for disadvantaged regions , and the forces of competition and technology will deliver . #% The cumulative effect of these proposals is to strip the Member States of very real and serious powers regarding setting taxes and to remove democratic accountability from the setting of taxes , which is dangerous for democracy and is certainly unacceptable to those who elected me to represent them in this House . #% I am sad to report that the figures for 1999 show that this was the first year ever when the least developed countries received under 50 % of overseas development aid administered by the Commission . #% I still congratulate you on one remark made to me this morning - by an old Hull trawler-owner who still operates part of our deep-sea fleet - that at last you have got a Commissioner who says what she thinks . #% I would conclude by noting that there is one major point on the availability of financial resources . #% I finish , where I started , by saying that we are right to treat this with the utmost seriousness . #% We should support this report and give her our backing . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , a well-known businessman once said equality legislation , taken too far , actually reduces the chances of women gaining employment . #% The answer , without exception , was that they wanted to be consulted because that implied respect for their experience and their opinions . #% That is clearly an inappropriate way in which to legislate and not a particularly effective way to pursue the goal of competitiveness . #% If it is unsafe it should be closed down immediately . #% Give it a name and give it a guiding spirit ! #% You will be aware , I know , that I am dealing with a report that is going through Parliament at the moment on services of general interest . #% In 2004 the Postmaster General stated categorically that the British Government did not want VAT on stamps . #% Mr President , as the Vienna Monitoring Centre showed last year , there is a need for a progressive policy and leadership in both areas under debate today . #% If he makes that announcement -- which I believe he will -- can the Council protest in the strongest possible terms about this travesty of justice , as a matter of urgency ? #% It threatens parity and prosperity for the developing world , jobs , growth and security in Europe , and the future of the multilateral trade system itself . #% We had the final proposal submitted to us on 18 October this year , 14 days after the deadline for first payment . #% Mr Schnellhardt just mentioned alcoholic products . #% But Mr Clarke said that we should share this information provided that there was a clear legal basis upon which to operate . #% What particularly worried me during the previous mandate was the way that certain Commissioners ran their own individual empires . #% We are also opposed to open-ended CFSP funding without adequate justification . #% We also need to look at access , so that all of those who need early years education services can get hold of them . #% That is why we need an end to the death sentence . #% I should like to focus on my report on port state control , which is an essential part of our regime to make sure that events such as that involving the Erika never happen again . #% In that context we join with the rapporteur in feeling that some kind of special provisions concerning subsidies are merited as long as those market distorting subsidies continue elsewhere . #% Bearing in mind that the Colombian Government ' s own public defender reports one massacre for every day this year and that the Commission of Colombian Jurists attribute 78 % to paramilitaries with the knowledge of the official Colombian forces , will you , as President of this Parliament , in your private talks ensure that you discuss issues of human rights . #% In 2005 Mr Blair promised that the British Presidency would cut red tape . #% Since then the human rights situation in Ethiopia has remained dire , while in Eritrea it has deteriorated from adequate to very poor . #% Conservatives strongly support positive action on climate change and this is why we proposed an ambitious but realistic target of 60 % of electricity in the EU from ultra-low or non-CO2 emitting and CO2 neutral energy technologies . #% Finally , I urge the Commission not to relax its declared position . #% The second amendment was exactly the same as a group amendment . #% The reality is that there are millions of people in the world who are seeking sanctuary in the European Union . #% ECHO still needs more support in order to do its essential work of implementing the accords . #% The abolition of the tariffs now being negotiated in the CETA framework is , on the whole , acceptable to our group . #% I must respond also to the fact , of course , that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity , the complacency and the fragility of the Commission ' s opinion . #% For , as the Commission so eloquently puts it in its own document , it intends to create the European Aviation Safety Agency through the gradual integration of national systems . #% Furthermore , the issue of the settlements and the controversial status of East Jerusalem are not directly related to the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories . #% How it is going to be achieved ? #% Mr President , let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report . #% Mr President , I am afraid I am going to break the consensus so far . #% Those Member States that are opposed to reform will have to ask themselves whether they are serious about enlargement or not . #% Last night Commissioner de Palacio gave the House an assurance that if the proposal were to be rejected , she would not seek to reintroduce it . #% Mr President , I would like to focus my contribution to this debate on a number of key areas on which I take issue , both with the report and with the Commission 's original proposals . #% EU Member States do not spend enough on their armed forces and what they spend is often not spent well . #% But for Europe as a whole , it ensures that the needs of severe pockets of poverty and deprivation can be tackled alongside help to large regions suffering industrial decline . #% So there is a whole series of policies here which have to interlink to deal with issues about social inclusion . #% In particular , the European Councils , the European Youth Orchestra , the European Youth Parliament and the Model Youth Parliament . #% We started this debate at 11.30 a.m. . #% We fear that it will occur again on 7 April , although the Commissioner himself informed this House that the infringements that took place last year were in breach of regulations and promised to act . #% Unless we are able to establish a proper system of international cooperation in this area then we will not be able to deal effectively with these issues . #% Mr President , I am sure I speak on behalf of other colleagues when I say that this has been one of the most intriguing and perplexing issues I have ever had to follow . #% Mr President , today , 53 years after the military defeat of the Nazi regime , it is shameful that appeals still need to be made to governments and banks for assets stolen from Jewish people during the Holocaust to be returned to the survivors and their heirs . #% As Lord Inglewood has already said , it is a proposal that , politically speaking , has come at the right moment . #% A constituent of mine recently returned from a holiday in another EU country . #% There is one issue that I would like to make clear , and that is transparency . #% That is completely wrong . #% As far as I can see , it is a very simple problem of excessive water pressure so the water spills everywhere around the basin and on to the floor . #% I welcome the fact that the Commission supports my proposal in the resolution for one staff member per delegation in developing countries to be responsible for NSA consultation and participation . #% I believe that the issue of public openness on this matter is one we should take into account . #% 
If the aims of the OECD Working Paper of 29 May 2005 - which was adopted by both sides - can be put into practice , there would be great benefits . #% Mr President , despite the late hour it has been a refreshing debate . #% They confirmed many of the proposals I had drafted and suggested new areas for me to explore , such as vaccines , maternal health , biomass fuels and palliative care . #% Mr President , I welcome Mr Wiebenga 's report , not only for its strengthening of the practical arrangements for sharing responsibility for Kosovo-type situations which I am sure our citizens can relate to as a demonstration of European solidarity , but also for Mr Wiebenga 's insistence that a regime of temporary protection must not undermine and become a substitute for the Geneva Convention and the rights of beneficiaries to apply for asylum . #% Therefore , what is required is a simple benchmarking of projects to compare and contrast their effectiveness , to be undertaken perhaps by an independent auditor and used in conjunction with a clear and well-planned end-programme which will allow the termination of poorly operated projects and put an end to on-going waste - in essence , to introduce private-sector disciplines into this system . #% I call upon the Commission , as a part of the budget process for 1997 , to bring forward the harmonization of regulations for discharge for all the agencies , so Parliament can have some control over discharge . #% We need to increase that sum steadily over a period of years . #% I believe there is a danger that they would not . #% We must not give Milosevic any sort of victory or allow him to play any more games with the international community . #% That phrase was picked up by the Commissioner himself , who talked about the need for reform . #% We are trying to create a system where we would have a European Central Bank acting in the interests of the European economy . #% They are the exception rather than the rule , and it is most important that the Community , in responding to paragraph 10 of the report , does not acquire any general competence in criminal matters which should be left to the Member States . #% I pay tribute to Dr Brian Carroll of Bristol Zoo , in my own region , who has worked with zoos across the UK to collect a stunning half a million signatures as part of the Europe-wide campaign . #% And , as for ` Do you fall in worship , you millions ? ' , well I can tell you , over 200 million people say ` no ' . #% That an official from this DG 's Conservation Unit can dismiss the concerns with the words ' I must trust much more the opinion of our fishing industry if it is for them to obtain good returns from their landings ' suggests to me that he has a strange idea of conservation . #% It is only a minority who are vandals and hooligans , although they seem to capture most of the headlines . #% -- Mr President , we are voting on a particularly sensitive matter . #% Imaginative thinking is also needed for the final status of East Jerusalem . #% The vision , lack of provision of knowledge to empower and innovation was not catered for at a national level . #% But all that is politically attainable at present . #% How will extending QMV to delicate areas like social security and taxation help ? #% Secondly , we are a democratic society , and digital policy in the audiovisual sector can connect our local citizens to our citizens at the centres of power . #% However , they insist that national governments must retain absolute sovereignty over foreign and defence policy . #% Although complex , the three-tariff system helped , with the C quota reserved for ACP countries to export up to 750 000 tonnes annually to the EU at zero rate . #% If they go back to their former ways Parliament will be as irate at a future presidency as it is warm towards the present one . #% We also call for immediate measures to be taken to protect homosexual persons from degrading and inhuman treatment to which they are still subjected : because of their sexuality , they still face the death penalty in certain parts of the world . #% Mr President , I am taking the place of Mrs McNally who has had to go back to the United Kingdom this afternoon . #% No-one would argue with the fact that we need to seek to reduce the devastating consequences of drug abuse for drug abusers , their families and society as a whole . #% No new money is needed . #% We need to encourage good mental health . #% I hope we can get back to working together on the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , because the years ahead will see intensified challenges to , and dilemmas regarding , fundamental rights and we have to be even more systematic in our work . #% Some of those are brand new and it would be unfair to shut them down at very short notice , particularly when one considers the alternatives as to where this waste would have to go . #% This regulation has enabled us to intervene in countries where there is deep conflict with serious abuses of human rights . #% In what sense do we have any priorities when we have a disconnected list of 96 items assembled together in arbitrary order , not making it clear which is legislative and which is non-legislative ? #% On the basis of that analysis , I would like the Commissioner to be more specific on whether , when Cotonou was negotiated , an enhanced GSP was looked at as an option for those that could not or did not want to enter into EPA negotiations . #% Mr President , on a point of order , on Zimbabwe , I am appalled to hear that last week COREPER decided that the EU-Southern African Development Community Ministerial Conference , scheduled for 7/8 November , is not now to take place in Copenhagen but in Mozambique . #% Well , it is high time to be doing what we are doing in this area . #% For example , it recognises the right of third-country nationals legally resident in the European Union to free movement in Europe . #% Those are my two recommendations in this report . #% I would like to congratulate and thank you . #% By not granting discharge , MEPs sent a strong message to the management of all EU agencies that Parliament will not tolerate shoddy accounting , or spurious spending . #% Two days later , Toyota , which employs several thousand people in my region , stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant . #% This regulation speaks about International Terrorism generally and does not specifically refer to the events of September 11 . #% We are becoming years out of date with the challenges that we are meeting , not least because of the third-pillar problems of the veto in the Council to which she had referred . #% Yesterday 's television news showed pictures of thousands of Belarussians queuing outside a newly-open MacDonalds restaurant in Minsk , in freezing cold . #% While the British Presidency has to recognise that , at some point , it is going to have to compromise , it is also important for other Member States to realise that they must give too . #% However , there are 3 main reasons why I voted against the Report . #% The fact that the Council - although it might not be listening - is actually present in this debate is an important sign that the three institutions should indeed be working coherently together . #% At every stage , cooperation between nation states goes out of the window and central control from the European Union comes in . #% I would further like to thank Commissioner Fischler for his backing and I would also welcome the draft opinion on the report produced by the Committee of the Regions because it is going to do a report on young farmers . #% Actually that sensitivity is not confined to this Parliament . #% Madam President , I fully support the USA in its handling of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay . #% The key thing is how to make best use of the money , to cater for the very problem that the honourable Member mentions . #% The Liberal Group certainly does not want to undermine the pressure for high standards of passport and border security and the rule of law more generally , but this exercise has to be fair , consistent and effective . #% It reflects a very old-fashioned socialist command-and-control approach to economic policy which is not relevant to solving the problems of the 21st century . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on the way she has handled this complex matter and , as Mr Goodwill said , has brought the committee once again to a consensus . #% Parliament 's work should be followed up by a public enquiry in Britain . #% Remember this : the European Tour Operators Association reckoned that 3 % more American tourists were liable to choose Europe as their holiday destination because of the euro . #% Clearly part of our job is to aid that transformation to an industrial society and aid the transformation to a modern democratic , pluralistic society . #% There are certain areas that still need to be addressed . #% The African Union is hopelessly stretched at this time and can not fulfil its mandate unless we see much more concerted efforts to beef up the military support that they need in that country . #% The peer review would lead me to conclude that it should definitely be published . #% We aim to establish a business-led skills taskforce and a jobs database to overcome the skills shortage . #% We want the other parts of the world to pay attention because what we do is useless unless the Americans , Russians and Asians are involved as well . #% We would have seen once again as we saw in 1991 , the use of helicopter gunships and aircraft to murder , to gas and to displace . #% Our amendments say they are compatible . #% 
It has actually tackled this issue as we asked it to do . #% I urge Parliament to be realistic and constructive so that our essential work in both these regions can continue and can grow . #% Mr Cassidy , are you going to join the Labour Party ? #% I also pay equal tribute to the parliamentarians of the ACP countries , without whom this partnership and dialogue would not be possible . #% I want to put this into some sort of context . #% This problem has been exaggerated totally out of proportion . #% . -- Mr President , it is a great pleasure to see you in the Chair at the beginning of this debate on the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly , which you do so much to elevate and enhance . #% As the Liberal Group spokeswoman on the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , I wish the chairman of my committee to speak ahead of me . #% Technology and industry are better equipped to respond to consumer concerns in what is an immensely competitive market . #% We are opposed to political union with Turkey just as we are opposed to political union with Germany , France or Italy . #% That is not something which can be left to the transport Commissioner , it is an initiative that should come from Mrs Wallstr√∂m . #% We should be alert to and aware of the dangers of sudden outbreaks of highly infectious and dangerous diseases which can suddenly spread on a global basis . #% I wonder whether the Commissioner would agree that the last two questioners who were asking the Commission for action would do better to ask their own party leader , Mr Blair , to get the over-high level of the pound - which has been kept too high by high interest rates in the UK - down to a realistic level ; and also try to get Mr Blair to start campaigning to join the euro , when there would be extra transparency . #% And while we are giving out congratulations I shall also congratulate the Commissioner on her speech which was politically realistic . #% We can urge , as we do in our strong and powerful resolution , the current government at all levels of Iraq to protect religious minorities and -- in this resolution -- most particularly the Assyrian Christians . #% Deplorably , Myanmar is not a signatory to the Convention and there are indications that she has planted mines inside Bangladeshi territory including on agricultural land . #% He has just told us that the FVO missions to Brazil and Thailand , and probably elsewhere , were cancelled because 100 % testing is now in place within the Member States . #% On Category 1 , the BSE crisis and now foot-and-mouth are raging , if that is the right word . #% The problem is that some have not and will not , so this means that the proposed regulation goes beyond the strict terms of Dublin by guessing at or anticipating the existence of an asylum application . #% But it has to be able to deliver mindful of the concerns and worries that have been expressed , not just in my country , but in other Member States as well . #% We are today drawing a line that must not again be shifted . #% I would particularly like to express appreciation of the efforts made by Australia in its region in its peacekeeping role , as we recently also saw in the case of the Solomon Islands . #% Blair needs to understand that the route to partnership with Washington is via Brussels . #% For these reasons my Group will be abstaining and not voting in favour of this package . #% Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here . #% Political debate is robust and voters have a genuine choice . #% There is an urgent need to establish an organisational framework for cooperation between the national authorities responsible for the application of consumer law . #% But certainly this and many other cases show that we do need to improve our criminal justice standards overall , throughout the European Union , on matters like the availability of interpretation and legal assistance and indeed judicial independence . #% The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context . #% Within the South-East of England , many families are victims of the harsh reality of a poor supply of organs necessary for transplantation . #% We will look today , for example , at the situation in Tunisia . #% Where would Europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ? #% You have made some reform progress but not enough . #% Current information is that Russian troops appear to have secured most , if not all , of the villages occupied by the invasion forces from Chechnya . #% On the contrary : the and being a member of the EU means that we adopt fully and transpose properly the . #% I have always urged the British Government and the Council to go further in a liberalising direction , but my words have fallen on deaf ears . #% We have to be very clear on this . #% You did not say in your speech that this directive contains a hundred separate measures directed at Member States to remove barriers to service businesses , to reduce bureaucracy , to simplify administration and to give more information . #% Now it includes the proposal from the European Convention for a legal base on civil dialogue . #% The question in committee has been about the timescales which should be involved . #% The question arises in our own Parliament of how we are to handle the vast array of different political parties , 25 nationalities and 20 different languages . #% People who suffer from these diseases have a life sentence : they do not die , they stay alive and their condition degenerates . #% The JPA is a unique instrument of cooperation and solidarity , North and South . #% Nevertheless , I and the Socialists think that we need a set of practicable , sensible , enforceable Community-wide standards which will deliver us a landfill industry which gets rid of many of the evils of the past . #% I do not think that it will be helped by the amendments being proposed inside this Parliament today and indeed in our committee . #% We emphasise the word partnership which is about dialogue between two parties not one party constantly lecturing another . #% However , one matter still is outstanding . #% The next step will be to extend the principles of the code to countries like Russia , China and the United States . #% In time we can enlarge , yet under no account should we enlarge so quickly that we undermine the European Union , which we have built so strongly in the last 40 years . #% The UK Labour rapporteur had called for yet more EU legislation , rather than inspiring companies to choose to adopt the concept themselves . #% We must encourage them to do so . #% We have to move the debate forward . #% Let me deal with just a couple of issues . #% It is an opportunity for us not only to give a profile to this subject but also to call for action . #% I hope , whether you stay here or go on to something else , that you will help to stir the national politicians who so far have lacked the will to muster the necessary weapons to fight international crime . #% They want people to rely on their ill-informed prejudices about Europe . #% Let me also respond to the criticisms that have been made of the Constitution . #% He owns an electrical company and was only given the opportunity to set up this company due to the tax breaks and opportunities given to him by the Conservative Prime Minister and true Eurosceptic , Margaret Thatcher , back in the 1980s . #% I particularly welcome the resolution which establishes the European Conference and sets out its content . #% We asked the Hong Kong authorities to ensure that the Article 23 proposal would not be used to silence opposition . #% There is room for compromise , presumably over the implementation date . #% I recognise the problems with the express-vehicle industry but I am not sure how these proposals can be enforced . #% We should also , moreover , reiterate our refusal to sign a stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia before the delivery of its war criminals to the ICC . #% What is there to fear from opening our decisions to external examination ? #% If they are , let us challenge the WTO if they give an adverse decision . #% It has the right of initiative . #% 
Members , who , in the course of this debate , have properly praised Commission officials , who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity , hard-working and of great capability , are absolutely right in the comments that they have made . #% I therefore ask for the House 's support for a referral back to committee . #% Tactically , our first task tomorrow must be to defeat the simplistic proposals to reject the second reading . #% Mr Tomlinson would say that there is a lack of qualified staff , certainly when it comes to accounting and financial control within Parliament . #% Maximum harmonisation infringes this right . #% I must also reserve our position on Amendment No 18 which I have seen for the very first time tonight and which would seem to require some very careful consideration . #% However , we are trying to reduce those costs , especially on buildings . #% That is the measure of the problem . #% Mr President , the Taoiseach says that he believes that the principle of the dual-majority system is now accepted . #% This is a case for absolute objectivity and attention to the rules . #% I should like to highlight three particular aspects of the situation : refugees , EU funding and the landmine issue . #% This proposal suggests that , on emotive subjects , the Commission is prepared to act on the basis of that emotion , without the kind of sensible assessment of risk that we need here , as we do for example on risks in foodstuffs . #% The Commission has already come to us asking for urgency at a very late date , on the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina . #% in writing . - Whilst we are opposed to EU membership and therefore EU funding , the money in this fund has already been allocated and is not therefore ` new ' money . #% I thank the rapporteur for his patience , his skill and , above all , his commitment to the cause of Europe 's railways . #% Can he say anything about the time scale for vaccination ? #% In my country , the UK , under a Conservative Government , we made a dash for gas , since natural gas produces far less CO2 than coal . #% That is a very important matter and , in future , we at least will be requiring functional justification before spending is approved . #% For too long now , national monopolies controlled by governments have prevented new entrants from offering gaming services in Europe . #% Lastly , I hope we can rely on you in the field of civil liberties and human rights . #% For example , abuse occurs in residential institutions where people are deprived of basic human dignity , including the use of caged beds in psychiatric institutions in countries which will next year become full members of the European Union . #% The Czech Republic and Hungary are right to ask for equality . #% Of course the agreement is weak , but we have to start somewhere . #% For non-specialists like myself it became at times an impenetrable mass of acronyms and technical details , and Mr Glante and Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca at times seemed to be speaking a language that sane , normal human beings could not possibly follow . #% Commission scientists say they are satisfied , so why are the French flouting the rules ? #% Of course , the final stages of the LTTE campaign were awful . #% To take just one of these , transport is now the dominant source of air pollution in urban areas and despite the past decade 's improvements in air quality in Europe , close to 90 % of the urban population is still exposed to excess ambient levels of particulate matter , NO2 , benzene and ozone . #% Also , the state 's first duty is always to protect its innocent citizens from future attack from any such terrorist groups . #% We have seen some successes , as targeted measures against some of these organisations have brought results . #% Clearly it was a pity that the Commissioner was prevented from attending for family reasons . #% This is a hope that we share and are seeking to reinforce . #% This is a disease which has filled people with fear and horror for many years and it is a delight to see the reality of the decline in statistics which shows that the disease is now being eradicated . #% Perhaps the most shocking aspect was a decision by Mr Farage of the UK Independence Party to put out an opportunist press release that was at best in the worst possible taste and at worst an apology for terrorism . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency of the Council on what it has achieved in its six months , in a difficult situation : on Iraq - as we have heard - and also on specific dossiers like the European Statute for Political Parties , where a lot of hard work was put in . #% Equally I am at a loss to see why , if the PPE-DE Group is genuinely interested to allow the fundamental rights of freedom of travel for the President and senior officials of Taiwan 's Government , it wants to restrict this to strictly private visits , rather than leave it more open . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the Commissioner for bringing forward this proposal and our rapporteur , Mr Liese , for bringing forward this report . #% Mr President , I welcome this report and some of those we have seen going through Parliament in the last few months . #% I am always worried about these agreements because , although many new agreements include conservation measures , there is little conservation to be seen in reality . #% My final point concerns taking account of the extended multilingualism of the new Parliament . #% Our priorities ( i.e. the `` left-overs '' ) must be : #% When I took over as shadow rapporteur on this report , I did it with little knowledge of how interesting it would be and how , very soon , it would become apparent that the re-use of public sector documents would prove to be such an important economic motor . #% Where they fall within the legislative process there should not be a refusal , and , again , every request must be on a case-by-case basis . #% The Turkish judicial and penal system is in transition from a regime of retribution and oppression to a more western approach , where prisoners are penalised but not persecuted . #% What exactly is happening ? #% Mr President , I am as concerned as anybody in this House about the suffering of the people of Iraq as the result of sanctions but also of the actions of their own government . #% In the United Kingdom , Conservatives have been very quick to condemn European human rights guarantees as an outrageous interference in national affairs and as a breach of subsidiarity . #% But the best way to promote job security is for companies to be successful . #% This will put tremendous pressure on the smaller European manufacturers , like Triumph and CCM in the United Kingdom . #% Under the refugee fund , there has been a funding strand for cooperation between Member States which has led to some positive developments , but it has also become clear that there are limits to this more piecemeal approach . #% I would like the Commissioner to put on record the opinion of the Commission and its own residues experts on the number of tonnes of poultry from the states in question that have passed into the European Union without proper inspection . #% Mr President , can we take that as an assurance that no letter will be sent until the Bureau has met again on Thursday , because that is what I think the House would like to hear ? #% Some argue that to date China 's imports have mostly grown at the expense of imports from other third countries which have seen their share of the EU market decrease , but it is already very clear that the EU textile and clothing industry is experiencing significant pressure . #% From this committee 's work , the public was entitled to expect establishment of the facts and acknowledgement of the efficacy of the measures taken . #% Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to an internal matter . #% It is this that can be achieved from this sort of initiative , and this that will help Europe , its borders and its beneficiaries to put forward an agenda of change . #% I have always criticised the rampant corruption under Chairman Arafat and tried to investigate this in the last Parliament , but regrettably my working group findings were never debated in plenary . #% It is going to be a turbulent year . #% It is right and proper that the amendment that was put forward by the United Kingdom delegation was in fact passed . #% These we believe to prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference , and could risk less rather than more references to the UN itself . #% The peoples of Europe do not want a Union of ever closer centralisation , a Union that increases its powers at the expense of its Member States , a Union which is remote from their daily concerns . #% Certainly there is little benefit to the local fishing communities , and certainly no benefits to the ecology of the local fisheries . #% There is a group of people who very definitely are planning to be there . #% The Lom√© Convention is a unique partnership ; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lom√© and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora . #% We have recently had representations from some members of the veterinary profession arguing for an extension of the tattooing principle and claiming that the transponder chip can be surgically removed or otherwise nullified . #% It is a fearsomely difficult problem when Mugabe will not negotiate . #% Our group is also interested to note that the Greek Presidency 's priorities include the tasks relating to services of general interest , because we are going to be looking at the preparations for Cancun and the offers from the EU in that connection . #% 
Mr President , this report requesting banning the use of phthalates in some soft PVC children 's toys is flawed in many ways and rests on a dubious legal basis , given that the Chairman of the Scientific Committee for Toxicity , Eco-toxicity and the Environment , Professor Bridges , when he appeared before this Parliament 's Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy on 23 May , stated : `` It is hard to see how it '' - the ban - `` would come under a scientific interpretation of serious and immediate risk '' , which is the required criterion for the ban imposed in December . #% Mr President , I just want to raise two points : one concerns the extra money in category 3 that we negotiated with the Council at the last Conciliation Committee meeting concerning the deal at Copenhagen , mainly concerned with the codecision procedures . #% The entire EU budget is only two thirds of what the British Government spends on social security alone . #% The Fund has no role in the Raytheon project , nor could it have . #% Those are apparently based on adjustments never used in the European Community before . #% The things we have proposed about frontloading , the use of ramassage and so on are there to ease the pain of the Commission . #% We are going to agree on how we can violate the Treaty because of Annex XV . #% We challenged them and asked them to leave ; we got the security people to ask them to leave . #% In 2002 , for instance , the difference was EUR 200 million . #% The calls for `` black boxes '' which carry voyage data recorders , are a vital and concrete way to ensure that those ships calling at EU ports all adhere to common standards . #% As far as Mr Frattini is concerned , I want to emphasise again the concern that many of us feel about the proposed reform of the Rome I Regulation in particular , which is in serious danger of undermining the provisions for small businesses to be active in the world of e-commerce . #% The Commission 's draft directive envisages that Member States will be able to continue to set quantitative limits on the operation of pension funds . #% Although it is not covered by the 1997 Treaty on Landmines , it still has the same devastating effect on civilians . #% This is not a sexy dossier . #% Finally , we have also insisted that the EU 's new procedures should aim to contribute to the improvement of international relations by being as clear , transparent and reasoned as possible , so that their interpretation by third countries and their citizens will be facilitated . #% That means that liberalisation must , of necessity , be asymmetrical . #% It also called for the preparation of short-term action plans to deal with acute problems and for more public information and health alerts . #% Mr President , it is a very simple matter . #% If this is the type of behaviour which results in people being awarded positions in the Commission , it is little wonder that Europe is doing so fantastically badly in everything it turns its hand to . #% We should not be under any illusions about Belarus and we should not hesitate to break off dialogue if the situation deteriorates . #% But then I thought how this report would be greeted by , for example , a self-employed sole trader , such as a plumber or an electrician . #% In March this year the Freedom Party said : `` The newspapers were right once again . #% Whilst we have had to accept some compromises to reach a first reading agreement , we have reached a reasonable compromise , although we must continue to examine the problems associated with the use of cement in closed systems . #% Although falls from heights occur in circumstances where ladders and scaffolding are not present , the main focus of the proposal is on scaffolding , ladders and rope access , as you will see as you read . #% The abject failure to deal with the crisis is driving the European project into political deadlock . #% The rapporteurs have done excellent work here . #% With over 3.5 million people dependent on food aid and medical aid , we can not just stand by . #% Part of the reason I want to speak is a linked matter which relates to the citizen 's initiative . #% Would it not be advantageous in the long term for the European Union to develop , in addition , extra areas of spending other than those two , in order to achieve a better balance of interest to everybody ? #% Mr de Roo commented on Amendment No 36 that the eight-hour sleep limit is essential for everyone . #% There appears to be a growing conviction of the need for increased international cooperation on family issues as part of the global effort to advance social progress and development . #% On ghost fishing , we stressed the importance of monitoring the existing transitional measure , to ensure that it is not simply leading to displacement of effort , and the importance of the full involvement of the European Parliament in discussions relating to long-term controls . #% And why is it that they charge more for the same drugs in Africa , than they charge in the northern hemisphere ? #% Product labelling is one important way in which this misinformation can be countered . #% Unlike Mr Farage , I believe there are many occasions when it is important that we cooperate in Europe . #% I therefore have some questions for the Commissioner . #% At present there is some imagination but little action , given the extensive nature of Annex IV of the Treaty . #% Of special importance is the need for effective monitoring of animal movements and traceability . #% We are also told that we need additional flexibility so that people can do overtime to earn a living wage . #% We are looking at doing the same kind of thing , so that the current restrictions and difficulties that people within the EU have in crossing borders with cars and needing to re-register etc. , are eventually also phased out . #% I would urge caution , therefore , on the requirements for labelling in advance of scientific evidence and on applying the precautionary principle . #% Yet despite this evidence , many people here have said the inspections should continue . #% Let us bring forward that review of Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 , not reluctantly but with enthusiasm . #% Regrettably we witness yet another example where the efforts of the European Union and the wider international community to encourage change have brought few tangible results . #% Firstly , the context within which this macroeconomic dialogue is taking place . #% Israel is to be commended for its peaceful withdrawal from Gaza , which must now rapidly fall under the control of the Palestinian Authority , although the assassination of Moussa Arafat augurs badly . #% In that adversity we saw the best of human nature . #% It is quite clear to me that if you need two weeks off work for a bone marrow transplant it is not unreasonable for some form of payment to be made to your employer . #% So we should have the courage to look at the situation in a very clear and reasonable manner . #% However , we can not support items that we see as blatant encroachments on sovereignty , unless they are in themselves leading to greater cooperation . #% I can not see that `` EU origin '' is currently sufficient in the way of labelling and we are opposed to that proposal . #% And because I can not say these things , I can not justify to the electorate who voted for me a vote in favour of this new Commission . #% I would ask our Greek Cypriot and Greek friends in particular to give up their unilateral approach to the Cyprus problem , to be more even-handed , and to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Turks before it is too late . #% Or is the ambition to move towards a European state , with its own foreign and security policy backed by its own diplomatic service and army ? #% Colleagues have expressed worries about data protection and concerns as to whether there are sufficiently robust safeguards contained in the Schengen Agreement . #% So that is something that should be looked at , because Mr Kinnock made it clear yesterday that the Commission was keen to give Members a response straight away to the detail of my question . #% Secondly , has the Commission drawn any conclusions as to the security implications of its participation in the military committee ? #% What will the Commission do if they should harm her or rearrest Aung Sang Suu Kyi ? #% Amendments Nos 26 and 28 to 13 ( 5 ) therefore seemed rather confused - one seeking less and one seeking more detailed information for consumers . #% You say he pulled a gun on you and what you did was in self-defence . #% In the long term , I can see the merits of the single European eco-label , but this must not be imposed on those with existing schemes . #% British Conservative MEPs have been at the forefront of campaigning for less regulation and enforcing such impact assessments . #% Mr President , after listening to what the previous speaker has to say , I ask why can not we have pride in the television of the public broadcaster and in the television of the private broadcaster ? #% Last December , Commissioner Kinnock promised to this House that we would receive a review on the workings of the voluntary Code . #% Whilst the British government has expressed an intention to apply for a national derogation within this area , it is our opinion that the interests of the voluntary sector are best protected by the existing exemptions . #% It will perhaps surprise colleagues that the regulatory content of this regulation before us occupies eight clauses and three pages and yet we had 200 amendments . #% 
( Applause from the centre and left ) The essence of democracy is that individuals have guaranteed rights against the state . #% Mr President , I wish to make a personal statement . #% All the other countries of Europe increased them . #% Finally , human rights . #% On the other hand , there are some members of the committee who argue that a 0.1 % level would have been perfectly feasible and pointed out that some supermarket chains around the European Union are insisting on a 0.1 % level . #% However , many of us in this House are concerned not to allow the principle of mutual recognition to undermine the rights of the individual and in this field generally it is essential that the legal safeguards outlined not only in the European Convention on Human Rights but also , I would say to Mr Blokland , in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - which ought to be legally enforceable - should be observed . #% Madam President , under Rule 29 ( 4 ) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group . #% The European Union is a self-perpetuating political bureaucracy . #% There has been political , press and religious freedom . #% Earlier this year I wrote to the British Foreign Office to ask that Nicaragua should be included in the heavily-indebted poor countries initiative , particularly in view of Nicaragua 's success in meeting structural adjustment targets , and to ask that this should be pressed at the Consultative Group meeting in April this year . #% Mr President , in congratulating Mr Mart√≠nez Mart√≠nez on his report I reiterate that our major achievement in the last twelve months has been to support the signing of the Cotonou Agreement , a huge restatement of Europe 's commitment to development against a backcloth of globalisation and liberalisation elsewhere in international relations . #% Venture capital is needed to create new jobs in start-ups . #% I welcome the ban you have imposed on Thai chicken meat but you have not banned cooked meat or canned meat , and this accounts for about 75 % of our imports from Thailand . #% Although Iraq is different from Afghanistan , we have given EUR 1 billion to Afghanistan over a five-year period , and , if we take into account the Commission proposal , we have given EUR 200 million to Iraq over an indefinite period . #% Worse still , a majority of Commissioners-designate have indicated in their hearings that they fully intend to implement aspects of the Constitution falling within their respective portfolio areas , in advance of ratification . #% Too many LDCs have totally unsustainable debt burdens . #% Asking is exactly what the British Prime Minister has had to do . #% Will the Commission accept GDP as one of the extra qualifying criteria for Objective 2 ? #% Two million Afghan refugees are sheltering in the Islamic Republic of Iran and they have been for some years now . #% We have tabled an amendment asking for a significant sum of money to be placed in the reserve for OLAF . #% One important point he made was that he felt that , in his opinion , there should have been a referendum in Germany on the introduction of the euro . #% They are technically very difficult to implement and the prospective benefits that are produced are not very great . #% Mr President , China is a great nation and has been a great civilisation , but its name and standing are diminished by its human rights abuses . #% The Commission has requested urgency for an increase in commitment appropriations to Georgia for 2006-2007 , to the sum of EUR 10.5 million . #% I share and understand those concerns . #% Consequently , we are faced with a limitation because we are a public institution . #% In most other industries such a concentration or potential abuse might be temporary , but in this field if any one company does secure such a strong position it will almost certainly have it , if not forever , then at least for a very long time . #% It will prosecute the worst kind of crimes , such as genocide , mass slaughter , widespread rape and ethnic cleansing . #% We must end this tyranny and free the Iraqi people once and for all . #% Nobody asks why it is being done and who decided to do it . #% Mr President , Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe . #% We are convinced that the future MEPs from the new Member States will support our demands . #% Why should Uganda 's parliamentarians choose to throw all that goodwill away ? #% This morning whilst we were having the debate , colleagues from various different groups approached me and said that they would like a roll-call vote . #% He is right in saying that there are a number of areas of agreement between the Commission and Parliament , not least in the DAC reporting where progress is such that we very much welcome it . #% He has built lavish palaces ; he has erected statues of himself while his people remain impoverished . #% In a situation where the Bush administration has withdrawn funding for international organisations on women 's reproductive health if they even include abortion advice in their functions , it is crucial that the new Commission carries on the work led by Poul Nielson of substituting EU funding for the American cuts . #% We need to be more positive about Euronews . #% I have been asked whether we are going to use naval bases in Cyprus and to address a conference of Canadian soldiers . #% I hope that you will rule that the vote , as per our agenda agreed on Monday , will go ahead and I have two points to make to our colleagues in the PPE in that respect . #% If there is any confusion on that could we at least have some clarification for the future . #% Can we totally guarantee their safety ? #% It declares in paragraph 1 that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under the relevant resolutions including resolution 687 of 1991 . #% We are impatiently awaiting EU action on this . #% You need to know when to advance , when to yield a little , and when to see that there may be further room for compromise . #% He brought China to its knees . #% In my view there is much that can be done . #% For that reason we particularly welcome the adoption of amendments on consumer health and safety in the Schmitt report 's emphasis on the provision of information on health and safety requirements for airline passengers and the Collins report 's adoption of the proposal that there should be an evaluation of health risk and research into matters like deep-vein thrombosis . #% I should like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur for his efforts but I plead with the Commission to state this evening what actions they will now be promoting both within the Commission and the Council to put these fine words into action . #% That was not the intention at Doha . #% The Commission is reassured to note official statements from Moscow that neither the crisis in Dagestan nor the Moscow bombings will be treated as a cause for declaring a state of emergency and thus postponing the forthcoming duma elections . #% I know that part of the next generation of the ` Geant ' programme , which the Commissioner launched last week , will address that issue . #% Seventy percent of the world 's 1.3 billion poor are women and lone women heading households are increasing dramatically across the world . #% British Conservatives reject the European arrest warrant and do not accept that this problem has anything to do with Third World poverty , as many terrorists come from wealthy middle-class educated backgrounds . #% But let me touch on four areas of concern , most of which are set out in today 's resolution . #% However , I am concerned that , from the point of view of my own country , the United Kingdom , the current proposal tabled by the Commission would seriously undermine a proven system of consumer protection that has existed for hundreds of years . #% A pan-EU minimum wage would distort the issue . #% Some of its leading practitioners already have . #% The ruling in the Cassis de Dijon case was one of the key moments in the development of the internal market , giving precedence to the principle of mutual recognition over blanket harmonisation . #% I would like to emphasise the importance of that initiative . #% He has seen what has happened to his friend and main bankroller , Gaddafi ; and just a week ago , on 31 March , the Southern African Development Community , which includes South Africa and all Zimbabwe 's neighbours , at last voiced its grave concern at the resurgence of violence in Zimbabwe . #% Having said that -- and it is clear from your response earlier on , Commissioner , that we are not going to get much more clarity on this -- could we have an assurance from you that the Commission will look very closely and on a regular basis at the list of companies affected , and will update the list regularly , having monitored very carefully what will be necessary if this is going to be effective in any way ? #% Uribe 's policies for mass arbitrary arrest have shot prison numbers up by more than 10 000 in the last year . #% It is important for us that we see that he gets the resources he needs . #% The European Parliament , the parliamentary assemblies of the Council of Europe and NATO , as well as OSCE/ODIHR presence in Moldova , with Romanian and Ukrainian help , will prevent such a scenario . #% Obviously we welcome the moratorium . #% 
Given the number of times that we will be discussing and looking at the following year 's programme in the different fora over a year , my one fear is that , if we are not self-disciplined , we will spend an enormous amount of time looking at what will come up well over a year ahead , without being very concrete . #% What can you do to create a climate of truly reinforced respect for strict data protection observances in this context of a huge pressure to dilute it , as we have just heard with regard to the PNR case ? #% If not , when do you believe the final decision will be taken within the college of the Commission ? #% The old conventions and legal approaches need to be subject to some new and imaginative thinking if we are really to unleash the potential of e-commerce . #% Imagine you are that person and take the action necessary to defend those rights . #% In 1999 he earned USD 16 billion and at least , legally , he could not spend any on arms . #% Before allowing these talks to collapse , the world must ask itself how many more failures the WTO can suffer before it falls apart . #% Yet the studies in my home region have demonstrated considerable potential for renewable projects : wind , including offshore , small hydro , landfill gas , waste incineration , biofuels and photovoltaics . #% Madam President , we have to recognise that this is another step in the process of making sure that , when we deal with this new technology , it works for the benefit of human beings and not against them . #% I would like to underline that although the Minutes mentioned specifically the EPP Group , it is in fact not the only group to have acted in this way . #% Personally , I never put much faith in those promises , which is why I did not vote for the GATT Agreement . #% We have received a number of important additions to the text . #% Let us look , Commissioner Bangemann , at an industry that you and I have dealt with recently - the car industry . #% I do not believe that the founder of the Christian religion , who set great store by healing the sick , would inhibit those who simply want to cure sick people . #% We have put competitive instruments in place to stop vertical operators from abusing their dominant position in the marketplace . #% The report talks of benchmarks and objectives highly suggestive of quotas in all but name , and advocates deploying women on ESDP missions without clarifying their combatant status . #% We have reached an acceptable compromise , thanks to the heroic efforts of Mr Beysen . #% Apart from the fact that this is adversely virtually affecting Cuba itself , it is also having an adverse effect on American business because they are losing out by billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs . #% Mr President , referring to the proposed European Constitution President Bush has said that he is fascinated to see how the sovereignty of nations can be integrated into a larger whole . #% Mr President , the escalation of tension in the Palestinian territory was provoked by the Hamas-led kidnapping of Corporal Shalit with unrealistic demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners . #% We receive no minutes of these meetings . #% Some of these enterprises operate on an extremely small scale and make up in flexibility , innovation and quality what they lose in economies of scale . #% That strategic partnership must be rooted in economic and political freedom . #% Thus , I could not in good conscience support such a report , which explains my vote on the subject . #% What is the fallback position if nothing happens in the next month in the negotiations ? #% What concerns British consumers - and much of it is addressed in his proposal - is clearly the question of price . #% I am more than slightly concerned when I hear the Minister talking about the need to re-evaluate the European Convention on Human Rights . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission and Mr Cunha for their hard work . #% These proposals , to be set out in a communication that will hopefully be produced before Christmas , will build on the July 2002 communication on Information and Communication Strategy for the European Union , and will follow four principles for relay management set out in that communication : a more homogenous brand ; a more streamlined and decentralised set of information outlets and networks ; closer partnership with Member State authorities ; and more interinstitutional cooperation . #% This needs a serious public debate , mediated through this Parliament , on the basis of thorough privacy impact assessments accompanying each proposal . #% I should like to make a few remarks about the procedure and about the hearings . #% We need a complete overhaul to streamline and make crystal clear the unimpeded exercise of free movement . #% Mr Solbes Mira 's response seems to be just that he did not know what was happening . #% I ask the Commission to act swiftly and decisively in accordance with the recommendations of the Auken report . #% I also believe that it is very important for us to distinguish between the processes of market efficiency that liberalization implies and other policy objectives that we may wish to achieve , such as the question of universal supply , such as the aims to reduce CO2 and it is very important to keep those two distinct and separate . #% Two years ago , I personally attended , as an observer , the party 's congress with some 20 000 people , and saw and heard for myself their legitimacy in the eyes of their own supporters . #% The Commission 's categories regarding the minimum insurance requirements cover too wide a spectrum of aircraft and would have constituted a burden which is too high or even unbearable for smaller aircraft in general aviation . #% The response should be to come forward with better conservation measures , perhaps a ` days-at-sea ' policy which could be honoured by all fishermen throughout the Community , and not more proposals for decommissioning , particularly when our fishermen do not believe there is fair play in the implementation of the decommissioning schemes . #% It acknowledges that some people do not wish to work on a Sunday for reasons of conscience and it also acknowledges the special position of some of our minority communities . #% Was this agreed all along ? #% I spoke at a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union with parliamentarians from many countries all over the world . #% I am willing to bet that in all our countries we have a number of Member States ' citizens in unclear situations . #% We want to see a corporate code of social responsibility but we can see that this will be achieved only when we have an updated and completed legal framework in this area . #% That will require willingness and leadership on behalf of both India and Pakistan , and President Musharraf in particular . #% Similarly , it is essential that the levels of permitted radiation are set in a way that means food is safe to be consumed by people of all ages . #% Our policies must deliver for everyone . #% That is the right way to tackle this issue . #% It has not been easy trying to put those three together . #% Far too often , the Council and Commission are not prepared to trigger the use of these clauses to pressurise third countries to address legitimate concerns . #% That will be on category 5 and probably as regards the category 4 flexibility instrument if there is going to be such a thing . #% I feel he would have learned so much from me this evening ! #% They are referred respectively from the courts of Brescia and Bergamo . #% Indeed , what point is there in this debate ? #% We have moved far beyond a free market already : an internal market is an entirely different proposition . #% As a lawyer I know that my profession is not particularly known for being revolutionary . #% What is worse , some have even tried to divide the European Union into two classes of citizenship by saying that only individuals coming from a Member State in the Schengen area and in the euro area should be eligible . #% Stop this threatened tax on protection , relieve people 's understandable concerns and close the file as soon as possible . #% Firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds . #% The UN Security Council should also encourage global economic sanctions against the ruthless dictators of Burma . #% I hear much talk of the targeting of mosques . #% I have to say that cluster bombs are not antipersonnel landmines and it is bogus to try and confuse these two issues . #% The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of these measures . #% The problem is that our societies do not and politicians have to lead an honest and brave debate on all the ramifications of immigration . #% The Court of Auditors ' report identified a number of problem areas which I will come to shortly . #% As I have repeatedly said for many months now , and certainly this week , there is one issue the Council has refused to answer : whether or not depleted uranium munitions are being used in Serbia , Kosovo , what we previously knew as Yugoslavia . #% Mr President , I welcome this report as a very important first step in what is going to be a very important debate . #% 
Mr President , it is certainly necessary to improve the workings of the Dublin Convention and to transpose it into European Community law , with European Court and Parliament oversight . #% It was a nerve-wracking experience for both of us . #% As you can see from Mr van Velzen 's report , we see considerable merit in the substance of what the Commission has come up with . #% My report is : White Paper `` Teaching and learning - Towards the learning society '' . #% One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court . #% Again in its wisdom , the European Council has set up what I like to call a ` constellation of satellites ' . #% You and I , Joan , had a common view about the last financial perspective and I sense it is very clear that we have a shared view on this one , particularly regarding the length of the financial perspective . #% Hard measures should be taken against those guilty of exploiting children , as well as those who gain financially or are members of a criminal organisation . #% Some speakers have raised the question of whether Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing 's comments about Turkey were outdated , whether this was the wrong message at the wrong time and whether , if Turkey should become a member , that would really be the end of Europe as we know it . #% Would it not be more logical to make it this summer ? #% We are about to vote on a resolution which is in response to an oral question tabled to the Council last night . #% This was true of the former Soviet bloc but it is certainly not true of me and those of us supporting the amended report . #% Another point on Amendment 4 : why is the rapporteur against a sweetener which is known apparently as stevia ? #% We wish to thank the Commission for keeping to the format and timetable of the new arrangements and certainly thank the college for being present in such great numbers here today . #% What steps are you taking or proposing to take to hold to account those who have used violence apparently in your name ? #% We want to see that true partnership . #% Business tells us that recruitment needs to be made easier and more flexible at all skill levels . #% Mr President , I believe Romania remains on track for accession by 1 January 2007 . #% If we have more accountability built into the way we look at reform in these countries , I am sure we will have the kind of public services which deliver for people , make sure resources are used effectively and help us to pursue our own development goals of eradicating poverty and raising living standards . #% She will know that all of these professions and their associated professions - accountants and auditors - will look at any possibility to help their clients . #% The Commission must , in its next round of recommendations examining the achievements of Member States against the set guidelines , make the strongest possible recommendations against Member States who continue to fail to deliver in these and other important respects . #% Once they understand that message I am quite sure that the discussions we should and will have will be fruitful . #% It also , for example , states that 10 million animals were killed when farmers claimed for only 6.5 million . #% Organisations of disabled people are controlled by disabled people and by the parents of disabled people who are able to speak for themselves . #% Yesterday the President of Azad Kashmir came to the Parliament to open an exhibition at the start of EU-Kashmir week , the first time there has been such an occasion . #% That , coupled with the other rumours circulating about both beef and lamb , suggests to me that it would be important for the Commission to make a statement to this House , particularly after the Council meeting today . #% We know that a stringent , prudent budget was needed and we also know that employment had to be at the top of the agenda . #% Madam President , before the summer break the Parliament 's Bureau finally decided that it would publish the names of all the assistants of Members paid under Article 14 secretarial allowances , but since then we find that the Bureau and the Quaestors have qualified their decision and are requiring the individual consent , of both the Members and the assistants , before they appear upon the list . #% Lastly , I believe the time has now come under the roadmap for peace to prise brutal but rational and secular Syria away from theocratic , fundamentalist Iran . #% Along with my colleagues , I shall vote against this report . #% I and my British Conservative colleagues are fundamentally committed to upholding equal opportunities for all . #% As we have so often done in the environmental domain , we need an overarching framework directive first , setting out the general interest before we embark on specific sectors . #% We welcome the focus that is being placed on meeting our international obligations but believe that the time has come to focus on enforcing and monitoring existing targets and regulation , rather than creating a never-ending stream of legislation that is enforced -- at best -- inconsistently . #% We endorse the motion 's recognition of the freeing of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe from the yoke of Communism and their fight for liberty . #% Iraq is indeed guilty and in breach on all those counts . #% So we have everything to do on this and it is all beneficial . #% I come to a point which is of particular importance , and which Mr Bourlanges touched on towards the end of his comments . #% I must declare an interest as a director of a television company that will certainly be involved in digital broadcasting and the broadband communication field - though probably long after I have ceased to have any connection with it . #% in writing . - Whilst the ECR Group is in favour of improving lines of communication and cooperation between Member States in relation to health threats like epidemics , the report on H1N1 ill advises Member States on the facts surrounding H1N1 and on the precautions they should take in the event of another epidemic . #% There is another saying in Britain : ' do not spoil the ship for a ha ` p ` orth of tar ' . #% Who sets the objectives and strategy of the agencies ? #% Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa is the most prominent personification of Solidarity and its success . #% I share the platform this afternoon with my French colleague and I share his concerns for the future role of this Parliament . #% Already Britain has taken in over a third of a million people from the ten countries that joined in 2004 and it is now estimated by Migration Watch in the United Kingdom that when Bulgaria and Romania join we will take in another third of a million over the next three years . #% Last night we had 90 minutes of questions but only 11 questions were answered , mainly because all the Commissioners gave long , rambling replies . #% What puzzles me is what exactly is the status of the draft agreement brokered between Britain , the US and Turkey , between the European Union and the non-European Union NATO European members ? #% I look forward , with some trepidation , to the problems which we will encounter at conciliation on that one . #% I very much echo what Mrs Buitenweg has said . #% I , however , tend to take the view of the rapporteur and of those of my political Group in the Committee of which we are all members . #% So , this is a good initiative and one which I hope that we will be able to take forward . #% In conclusion , this is the usual understated , erudite competence which we expect and usually find from Mrs Fontaine . #% Sixty percent of the European economy is taken up by services and we have a complete network of anti-competitive restrictions among the Member States . #% The new parliament must now choose its president wisely . #% There are several reasons for doing so , but the key reason is one of simple principle : I do not think there is any evidence that suggests that the voters in my country or in any other country are happy for their money directly to finance political parties at a European level . #% Surely it would make a lot more sense if it were to take place before implementation of the project because that would ensure that anything untoward or any difficulties that might occur could be avoided . #% We are living in a computer age . #% Perhaps self-interest is pushing the United States along that multilateral road that many of us believe it is not prepared to take . #% I am concerned about what will happen if the Kyoto Protocol does not come into force . #% Despite this advice being publicly available , and despite the opposition of most Member States , the Commission took the decision to place the genetically-modified maize on the market without restriction on its use . #% Here we go again ! #% Where has all this money gone ? #% I would say that it is none of their business . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to join others in expressing our solidarity , sympathy and condolences for the Italian and other victims of the attack in Iraq last week and , of course , the victims of the horrific attacks on the synagogues in Istanbul . #% We must make it clear that continued funding requires the Palestinians to bear down with greater effect and greater consistency on the extremists . #% This is a challenge , but it is a challenge which must be met . #% Please get this sorted out . #% 
The issue overall is one of political will , not simply institutional arrangements , and that 's where this Parliament -- and this report -- can make its biggest impact . #% We have been losing foreign direct investment due to our failure to join the euro , but the signal that this part of the directive sends out about France and Germany may help to sustain Britain 's share . #% In the meantime , the Turkish Cypriots are dangling out there in isolation , losing trust in EU promises . #% I have to say that I am not convinced that there will be any real improvement at international level unless it is very slow as is the custom with ICAO . #% Is the EU position to support this ? #% We have seen the successive development in Europe of Industrial , Social and Economic and Monetary Union . #% Young Europeans today have that same idealism , energy , enthusiasm and desire to help . #% The report 's repeated references to the now almost wholly discredited Lisbon Strategy hardly add to its credibility . #% That requires , above and beyond everything else , downward pressure on the unacceptably high and legally dubious levels of subsidies which continue to flow to fossil energy sources in the European Union , notably , but not excusably , the coal industry in a number of large Member States . #% Certainly we should invite the Commission to look at this problem , but the last thing we should do is to anticipate the results of that analysis . #% In particular , I would hope that the Amsterdam Treaty will mark a point where we stop becoming obsessed by the harmonization of the process and become rather more concerned about the effectiveness of the outcome . #% Mr President , we all acknowledge that there have been two problems in the achievement of common asylum and immigration policies : lack of speed and lack of balance . #% It is imperative that any procedural decisions which would affect issues of national sovereignty are given full and serious consideration before any decisions are taken . #% It is good to see the Commissioner here this evening , because the Commission has put forward a flexible approach to crisis management in agriculture . #% The euro markets raised USD 1.6 trillion equivalent of finance for business last year and 60 % of that finance was in non-euro currencies such as the dollar and the yen . #% I would like to follow up my colleague Mr Newton Dunn 's inquiry by asking the Commissioner whether he has sought cooperation with the major Internet service providers in publicising these numbers . #% So this piece of legislation is absolutely essential both for the prosperity of Europe as a whole and for the prosperity of the individual families concerned . #% In essence , this is a good idea . #% Secondly , could the bureaucratic negotiations be tempered by an understanding of the past ? #% We are presented with the ludicrous situation that we are supposed to be a Europe without internal borders , yet as soon as somebody dies , when there is a great need for understanding and sympathy , we erect the borders merely because the body needs to be transported from one country to another . #% I ask the Commission to help us develop our contacts on discussion of specific issues such as agriculture in the intervening period so we can assist this intermediate solution . #% Future generations want them to stand firm . #% Mr President , members from across national borders and political boundaries are in support of John Packwood , who faces extradition from Spain to Morocco , which is something that could not happen to a Spanish citizen . #% Only 2 % outside the old Erasmus programme of students are actually mobile in Europe , which is not something upon which we can build a new economy at all . #% I also welcome the need expressed for the EU to prepare fully for the World Summit on Sustainable Development . #% That decision may incorporate some adjustments of regional funding in order to take account of that fact . #% The sugar regime therefore needs to be reformed in order to fit in to our new agricultural policy . #% We are interested in helping workers being posted . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner , as many of the signatories of CCAMLR , together with the EU itself , are European nations , whether we could take a radical stance here to ensure that not only is the land-mass of Antarctica protected but that we take very tough measures to protect the Southern Ocean in terms of its own marine environment . #% As the rapporteur has said , dosing cement with ferrous sulphate counteracts this problem . #% This is totally unacceptable in a free society . #% The problem is oil price shocks caused by major disruptions to oil supply , whilst at the same time demand grows across the world for this increasingly scarce resource . #% In addition , topical events in any given area of the Community law can also trigger an increase in complaints to the Commission and cause the Commission to step up its action to satisfy the needs of the political agenda . #% That could seriously threaten the future availability of the information to this parliament and our Members . #% We guarantee that negotiations will begin if they meet the Copenhagen criteria by December 2004 , but equally , we must be clear that , if the criteria are not met , then Turkey 's accession will be off the agenda for the foreseeable future . #% I was told this by one of the 15 press officers . #% The Committee is interested in including other sectors , even perhaps in transport and private housing , although this will be difficult to achieve . #% . Madam President , I warmly welcome my colleague Paul Rubig 's report which promotes research and innovation and backs a Commission initiative to promote innovation . #% Following the request to set up an agency made by the Cologne European Council , the Commission ' s proposal is largely based on the model of all other existing European agencies : a structure with its own legal personality and decision-making powers and with the Member States represented on a governing board . #% Paragraph 5 is an ambiguous reference to the Member States that have not put the text to ratification yet . #% That is understood . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Rothley , very much for the painstaking work that he continues to do on behalf of citizens and motorists throughout Europe in filling gaps in their insurance cover . #% The European Court of Justice has annulled the original agreement , and yet the replacement agreement only differs in its legal basis . #% Therefore the message from them is pretty clear : they do not want more Europe . #% I have never forgotten it . #% Should not the United States be encouraged to make a settlement with Cuba over compensation for nationalized properties as other states , including those in Europe , have done ? #% In many countries HIV/Aids has already begun to destroy the modest progress made since the 1980s and is today threatening the survival of entire societies . #% We need a budget which is more focused . #% Mr Ettl did a very good job in coordinating with the other two institutions . #% I believe that in certain countries they have virtually ceased to exist . #% This does not pose a threat to individual privacy , but it does represent a boost to enhanced security at football matches . #% This is an important subject : it ensures the solvency and financial probity of companies and it is especially important in view of the limited liability of companies . #% Secondly , the difficult issue of flight time limitation was not addressed by the Commission . #% I know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ? #% Had it saved just one asbestos worker 's life , it would have been worth it . #% Mr President , let us not lose sight of the fact that the F√§rm report is about giving Parliament some guidelines for the conciliation that will take place on 19 July . #% Mr President , I felt obliged to vote for the motion of censure because of the Commission 's incompetence and lack of financial control as manifested in the whole Eurostat affair . #% This is a debate about people and our concerns for them . #% We believe that the Charter will have three principal effects : first , it will reinforce the constitutional character of the Treaty ; secondly , it will be a point of reference for those , including this Parliament , that wish to drive European integration forward with a greater degree of democratic legitimacy ; thirdly , a Charter that is stylish and forceful will strengthen the profile of the Union for its present and future citizens . #% Experiments are going on all the time on this matter and just today the Commission was discussing the whole question of specified risk material and the question of a Community-wide ban both in bovines and in ovines and in caprines . #% But the standards we aspire to and we set are international standards , standards by which we must all be judged . #% The already poor human rights situation has deteriorated further since the passing of the anti-revolutionary law , aimed at suppressing protests , and many opposition leaders are jailed on spurious offences of corruption or , in some cases , simply made to disappear , presumably murdered . #% It is simply inconceivable that the US Administration in Washington would rush headlong into yet another trade dispute with the EU without first ensuring there is a minimum of political backing in Congress . #% I would argue a little bit with you on that because I believe it is unique . #% We have got to become more competitive . #% I know that the Commissioner would agree that humanitarian aid should not at any time be seen as a substitute for political action . #% 
I hope that the Commission will come forward with some concrete proposals which will bring about improved labour and social standards , as well as proposals to promote corporate social responsibility in its external polices . #% Firstly , on the deletion of the sufficient standard , Labour MEPs can not support this because it would mean that bathing waters which meet current standards , would suddenly be classified as ` poor ' ( the sufficient standard being proposed is twice as strict for coastal areas as the current minimum standard ) . #% The reforms comprise a clarification , as well as a formalisation , of the privileges and immunities system , thereby meeting the requirements of the Court of First Instance in a separate related case . #% The chemicals directive and chemicals policy is the subject of a separate effort within this House . #% Thus , when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe . #% There are the Cassandras in this House and in the American Congress who will use any issue to say that the transatlantic relationship is not working , that it is disastrous and should not be continued . #% I am particularly pleased to hear that attention is being focused on one group of people who are often ignored by politicians , namely children . #% I hope that this is the sort of scientific cooperation we are now moving towards . #% We became strategic partners in June 2004 , yet it was another year before a joint action plan was agreed . #% The banana regime , as you know , is something that has caused major problems between Europe and the United States . #% There was a mistake in Amendment No 8 as a result of a mistake in the original draft , which has now been corrected . #% If the clear will of the House is that there was a sufficient majority , then that decision would need to be enacted . #% Mr President , this joint motion for a resolution on the ratification of the Rome Treaty to establish the permanent International Criminal Court comes at an opportune moment . #% Mrs Banotti 's speech this morning is further evidence that even in countries where there has been a deep-rooted reluctance to change the social and legal conventions , there is movement in the direction of logic , rationality and civil rights . #% Their findings made clear that this is a government which has delayed implementation of the directive on the energy performance of buildings , demanded an increase in the UK 's level of CO2 emissions permitted under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme , failed to set binding targets for energy-demand reduction under the energy services directive , and failed to promote small-scale combined heat and power plants in line with the cogeneration directive . #% However , I agree with the Commission that this issue has much wider implications than simply controlling 44 chemicals in our existing proposal and their potential dangers . #% The economic collapse in Zimbabwe is pulling down neighbouring countries . #% This is a great breakthrough for all airline passengers and also for the airlines , because it will not affect good airlines which look after their passengers . #% The problem is a shared one , the solution is a shared one . #% BSE has already cost the UK GBP 1.5 billion in lost exports . #% Unfortunately , the resolutions before us do not make sufficient distinction between these two issues . #% It is important to bear in mind , given what we heard already this evening , that Lisbon was not about competition , but social cohesion as well . #% I hope that it will readily withdraw it when we reject it tomorrow , as I am sure we will . #% How can they argue that the Davos package is too generous to President Mandela 's South Africa ? #% From my perspective , the most significant development in China of recent years is the move towards China becoming incorporated into the world trading system . #% I welcome this project . #% Consider the facts . #% I voted in favour of both amendments 1 and 3 for the self-evident reasons that Brussels is a far better place to conduct our business economically and efficiently than Strasbourg . #% The bulk of the Union 's responsibilities are what could be called shared competences , where the intensity of Union action varies greatly from one subject to another . #% Secondly , we want the implementation or non-implementation of the code by employers to be seen as part of the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex : we want the implementation of this code to be taken account of in tribunals . #% On average a refill cartridge can be sold for about half the price of a new product , and the consumer should have the change to reap the benefits . #% I should be most grateful for a clear explanation of precisely what the problem is inside the Council . #% Why do we need the risk capital action plan ? #% Wages are not a competence of the EU , nor should they be . #% Despite the number of efforts made by our government at the moment , you see that the share of the poorest 10 % in the population 's net income is 2.8 % , while that of the richest 10 % is 28 % : ten times as much . #% The main purpose of the no-fly zone is twofold : to prevent Saddam using his helicopter gunships and other aircraft against the Kurds in the north and the Shia marsh Arabs in the south , and to carry out reconnaissance , bearing in mind that there are no UN inspection teams operating in Iraq at the moment . #% Like the rapporteur and other colleagues I recognise that forestry is a very important industry , important for the economy and important for the environment . #% Mr President , the Minutes are correct but I should like to make a comment . #% We desperately need these particular black boxes to be fitted sooner rather than later . #% I urge the Council and the Commission to take on board the issues raised in the Rocard report . #% However , we can not support the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams . #% The concerns which have been expressed by the European Central Bank , which have largely , but perhaps not fully , been taken on board , are coming out in a way which is likely to damage the potential for this business to develop . #% The Council needs to be scrutinised in the same way as every other European institution , and written documents must be provided in order for discharge to be granted . #% An inter-parliamentary delegation between the WEU Assembly and the European Parliament would assist in this task . #% Rather surprisingly , Belarus is also enjoying a 4 % growth rate economically . #% Madam President , as a member of Parliament 's Delegation for relations with the People 's Republic of China , I welcome the statement and reassurances given by Mr Byrne . #% I have to say to the Council that it is not acceptable that the service is placed in the same class as the Economic and Social Committee or the Ombudsman as part of the Financial Regulation . #% Could you please do all in your power , particularly with the Green Paper on mental health coming to the end of its consultation period on 31 May , to address the issue of community-based care and getting people away from institutionalised care , not just for children but for people with mental health problems as well . #% In some cases this has been described as verging on a public health crisis . #% The longer this dispute continues , the more likely there will be a boycott of French food by British consumers . #% We now have the anomalous situation whereby Gaelic will be available for those from Scotland , Spanish for those from Gibraltar , but not Welsh for those from Wales . #% I also want to draw attention to a few amendments . #% It is a pity it has taken so long . #% Mr President , the Turkish Government has moved at astonishing speed to fulfil the European Union 's political criteria so that the right decision can be taken in December for accession negotiations to be opened . #% Mr President , I will confine myself to just one island - the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England - the favourite holiday island of Queen Victoria . #% ` Certain requirements ' is the wording on which the whole comitology system is based . #% It ignores scientific advice ; it keeps setting quotas far , far too high . #% Is the EU about respect or defiance of international law ? #% The EU/US Summit which takes place the day after tomorrow is exactly the right place to start since it is the US which has been found to be most politically wanting in recent weeks and months . #% We are saying now to the Belgian authorities and the European football authorities that they should choose the option of a safer ground that is available elsewhere in Belgium , and the stadium in Brussels has been cited . #% Last night Parliament 's Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a critical report which notably urges Turkey to ` take concrete steps for the normalisation of bilateral relations with EU Member Cyprus ' . #% It is possible for Parliament to vote to finally reject the text , rather than refer the matter back to committee . #% Firstly , this paper is slightly more modest than its title suggests . #% The highest standards of financial management should be ensured in particular by strengthening internal audit capacities . #% Farmers in the European Union also want to grow many varied types of crops . #% If , at the end of my speech , the public gallery want to applaud or even give me a standing ovation , I shall be more than pleased . #% 
A check today , again in my own Member State , shows that British bus manufacturers and British bus operators are unanimous in their view that they want the directive to go through . #% I also take the opportunity to congratulate our own colleague in this House , Mr Micha≈Ç Tomasz Kami≈Ñski , who I believe played a major role in both the successful parliamentary campaign and the successful presidential campaign in Poland . #% One is that the 15 extra posts for OLAF are there , which we accept , but we need to stress that there has to be an SAB5 . #% That is why Karin Riis-J√∏rgensen and I tabled our oral question . #% A positive attitude was expressed in the Council towards our undertaking to make a survey of arrangements throughout all 15 Member States . #% What discussions is he having with his colleagues in the Development DG of the European Commission ? #% If we can do that , we will have a lot to celebrate . #% Other matters as diverse as safety in nuclear power stations and food hygiene laws have also been implemented to the high EU standards . #% The point I make is that British pensioners have to look to the British Government , German pensioners to the German Government and so on . #% And yet more status quo . #% With these important caveats in mind , I would like to confirm the ELDR ' s broad support for Mr Schwaiger ' s work and reiterate our warm thanks to him . #% Not only do we have a better relationship with our former colonies than most other European countries , but we are not dominated by the same protectionist imperative as the European Union . #% Mr President , I thank Mr Peter for his hard work on this report which we in the committee know has not been without its problems . #% We do not feel that Member States are showing much commitment and , therefore , we will not be supporting this proposal . #% We are simply doing our job . #% I am therefore very pleased indeed that seems to have been agreed and we seem to be making progress in that direction . #% The information technology Council meets on 8 October . #% The victory of 1945 would not have happened but for the steadfastness and courage of the United Kingdom and the British Empire fighting on alone and holding the German forces at bay for over a year after the fall of France . #% We are making sure that whilst there will be upgradings in line with the promotion aspects of the service commitments , we will not be allowing the fast-tracking that was destined to lead to this enormous extra cost in the coming year or two . #% I know that this report will be at least a recognition of some of the battles being fought in my own country by organisations such as INQUEST , where families are still trying to find out after many years what exactly happened when family members died in police custody , yet nothing is being made public and there is no proper retribution . #% Speed with certainty in this fast-moving new world is essential . #% It is only on the basis of that widely accepted and well-documented scientific evidence that the Commission takes its view . #% To a degree we have been guilty of that in this report . #% The 1994 framework agreement promised to deliver from the United States normalisation of relations , the end of the embargo , two light water reactors as part of the KEDO project and in the meantime 500 000 tons of heavy fuel oil per annum . #% However , within the last hour there have been developments and I have no need to raise the issue here . #% I agree with Mr Piotrowski . #% I therefore welcome the precautionary note clearly set out in the Commission proposal to regulate the use of new products with high concentrations of vitamins , trace elements , fatty acids , etc. as food supplements to normal animal feed . #% In conclusion , the European Parliament is a true friend of Romania . #% There will be fresh demands , not only in relation to Iraq , but in other places as well . #% I hope that in that regard they will not be accused of having gone native on this particular issue . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I too should like to thank the Ombudsman both for his report and for his interesting presentation today . #% What kind of timetable is there to get this directive agreed ? #% I should like to suggest that we have the statement on Kosovo from the Council and the Commission , we take one speaker from each group , as foreseen , and finish the debate there . #% The PPE-DE Group is in favour of the financial perspective covering a five-year period . #% These decisions have consequences for the Palestinians and the Lebanese , as we have seen . #% If you look at the Renault problem , it seems as though it has been testing the idea of a social dialogue , a social dialogue which possibly has not been quite so sorely tested before . #% Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel gives some answers : better internal market rules , priority for ICT in the fifth framework , priority for ICT in the cohesion policy and better conditions , better priority , for investment in ICT . #% Bearing in mind Mrs Fraisse 's call for vision and coherence , have we really done enough to bring home to the public in the present EU what completing the European family is going to mean , in the theatre and performing arts as well as other cultural fields ? #% I should like to emphasise four points which arise from her report . #% Suddenly they have become not merely another consumer item but a wonderful cultural experience . #% It is important to emphasise the practical nature of this . #% Instead , the priority should be to maximise the operational effectiveness of our own armed forces in the context of the full range of threats we now confront . #% What signal do we want to give ? #% I therefore request , President , that you write a letter on behalf of the European Parliament to the British Prime Minister expressing our shock and horror at the magnitude of this terrible disaster , asking him to and pass on our deepest sympathy to the relatives of those people who have died , and also to the relatives of those who remain seriously injured in the hope that they make a full recovery . #% We have therefore to consider what political message we are sending by doing that . #% But having spent a decade obsessed with its own institutions , the European Union now needs to get back to business . #% . The British Conservatives today abstained on this report . #% We welcome the emphasis upon the smooth and efficient functioning of markets . #% Let us now hope that all the parties can come together to get the roadmap for peace back on the road . #% At all costs all parties must ensure that the current situation is not allowed to destabilise Dagestan , cause destabilisation in the longer term , or lead to greater political instability in Russia as a whole . #% So I welcome the statement and hope we will not let matters get out of proportion . #% I would conclude by urging the Commission to ensure that this amendment to the directive is implemented , is transposed and is enforced by the Member States . #% Neighbours , everybody needs good neighbours ; with a little understanding you can find the perfect blend . #% There is a contradiction in its approach . #% In response to Mr Ferber 's amendments , the Commission feels that Amendment No 21 would significantly reduce the effective scope of the measure by restricting the number of eligible candidates for early retirement . #% Perhaps there is an image abroad that South Africa is an increasingly developed country and does not really need these funds . #% When does the Council anticipate that the negotiations will address the institutional chapter ? #% In the circumstances we must reiterate and renew our condemnation of the continuing gross violation of human rights in Iran at home and abroad and increase pressure on the Iranian authorities on all these issues . #% Mr President , this is the third occasion I have been asked to be draftsman for the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport . #% He has told us of the 1.2 million vehicles stolen in the European Union . #% Mr President , I should like to ask those in this House to imagine themselves as an 18-year old on holiday in another country . #% Now , I want to be controversial and I am spelling out that word , because I do not agree that all we should do is push back the spending and get an enormous lump in four or five years time . #% It is a matter of urgency . #% Mr President , I very much welcome this initiative by Parliament and by our colleagues in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . #% Mr President , Mr Duisenberg , we MEPs , as we have stated a number of times this evening , have a unique role to play in relation to the single currency because this Chamber here is the only place in which the people of Europe can have any democratic input into how their new currency is run . #% Much still needs to be done to improve human rights , but let us not forget that some extremist groups misuse the label of human rights in order to promote sympathy for their own cause . #% 
That is the way to deal with the serious and unacceptably high level of unemployment in the European Union . #% I would ask her to look at them . #% We believe that more time is needed to consider what , if any , steps should be taken on the specific and immediate ramifications of this judgment before seeking to use it as a pretext for usurping national competence in criminal justice matters . #% Can I also touch on the question of taxation since Mr G√∂rlach mentioned it in his speech . #% Beneath the veil , behind the tribal dress , beyond the cultural differences of East and West , Iraq and Iraqis have the same high hopes of the essential freedoms and the rule of law that we Europeans and Americans enjoy . #% It is sensible to simplify the two key tests relating to public health -- on gastro-enteritis and e-coli . #% In broad terms , we must welcome these controls , but we have to be careful that we do not over-regulate . #% That is more appropriately done in the review in the year 2000 . #% A double lock is built in there , because they must agree to incorporate an alternative dispute-resolution mechanism before they can use the alternative clause and the terms must also be made very clear to the consumer concerned before he accepts them . #% In the past cyclamates have rightly been treated with caution . #% At the beginning of the year we saw snow on the ground yet , if you look at the figures , you will see that the first six months of this year were the warmest on record across the globe . #% Later on , my colleague , Ms Morgan , will talk about the situation of the Lao-Hmong people in Laos , which is particularly appalling . #% Why only a third ? #% May I appeal to the rapporteur to put that right in verbal amendments tomorrow when we vote because otherwise the Americans might think that it is some form of new-style cohabitation between Democrats on the one side of the House of Representatives and the Congress and Republicans on the other side . #% These two reports are a first step towards greater international cooperation in addressing terrorism and increasing international police cooperation . #% I sometimes feel when I come into this House and speak on telecommunications matters , that I could dip into a bag and pull out almost any speech and it would be appropriate to that particular proposal . #% Our message to EU governments is clear : real , environmental improvement through emissions reductions must be brought about by long-term , sustainable effort at home and not by cheap , ill-advised and potentially detrimental projects in the poorer countries . #% However , each of us , especially those who have served for more than one term here , should think about our actions or inaction in the past to properly check where money has been spent . #% Technically that would have brought any research using animals to a standstill . #% Mr Blair took a risk , and I think sensibly so , in taking the route of negotiation when others argued for confrontation , crisis , boycotts and bans . #% However , we may see the unfortunate situation of local authorities - and consequently local taxpayers - dealing with orphan and some historic waste . #% Yes , some of us argue against harmonisation , but we also argue for cooperation between law enforcement authorities . #% Our task now is to act as the watchdog to ensure that those mutual commitments on trade and aid are fully realised . #% You may recall that at a previous debate I took inspiration from the late , great Elvis Presley when he said ` it 's now or never ' . #% We need to achieve better value for money and to tailor the scarce interpretation and translation skills to best advantage . #% In the latter context , the relevance of isolation and difficulty of access is already well known , particularly where islands are concerned . #% Tomorrow , Parliament 's working group looking at this will regrettably be publishing two separate reports . #% Mr President , I find myself with the unexpected privilege this evening of speaking second in this debate . #% As somebody who was there throughout the debate on Mrs Jackson 's report last night and who was the last person to leave the Chamber , I do not recall those words from the Commissioner . #% This follows from the US Administration 's failure earlier this year to continue policy drafting on the back of the Arctic Council 's Arctic Climate Impact Assessment . #% I have spoken to some of them here today in this Parliament , but their governments must be empowered to act and the EU itself must get serious . #% Moreover , correspondence with the President of the People 's Assembly of Egypt and the Ambassador in Brussels only seemed to underline Egypt 's complacency on this matter and eagerness to fudge and gloss over the issues . #% The EU can be proactive in this area by providing resources for education and increased awareness and by opening up the debate on violence against not only women but also against men : according to the UK Home Office , one in six men will suffer domestic violence . #% We are serious , and this is a serious signal that we have made together , that we aim for a real transparency portal between all of us , that we aim to ensure that our citizens can see the legislative process as it progresses through all its stages , and that they can have a real input and real insight into what we do . #% NATO needs to respond to new global challenges , realising the form of political and military structures is shifting from collective defence to collective security . #% Unfortunately , she could not be here today . #% I , personally , have always been a great subscriber to the principle of subsidiarity in European decision-making , but this is one area in a global environmental issue where there is no room for subsidiarity . #% The US is in favour of arbitration , but it strikes me that , when President Clinton visits these two countries next week , India should be asked to come to the negotiating table so that , together with Pakistan , it can find a long-term settlement to this Kashmir question . #% I should therefore like to inform those of my colleagues who do not already know , that there will be a meeting of the Committee on Budgets at 10.30 a.m. today in place of the coordinators ' meeting that was planned . #% We have specifically sought to widen the definition of child competence to include messengers , spies , cooks and porters , because children in all these roles are vulnerable to risk . #% I reject the arguments of those who object to Turkey 's membership on the ground that Turkey is not ` European ' . #% Right now , if we break the Interinstitutional Agreement , we go back to the Treaty , which gives Parliament a lot more power and a lot more authority . #% We never fought the IRA politically , because we were never clear on our own political objectives . #% In the telecoms context it is vital to ensure that consumers get all the benefits the free market can offer them , particularly the low-cost Internet access . #% First of all we have to acknowledge in this House and beyond that the creative and knowledge industries have become a driver in our new global economy and that the skills that we need therein have become vital to our performance in the European economy . #% We also know that intelligence and police liaison is inadequate : the German and Spanish authorities had different bits of information that could have identified the 9/11 terrorists , even if it could not have prevented that atrocity . #% This Parliament would be fully justified in saying to our own Council of Ministers and to the IMO : ` We told you so ! ' #% In the very week after Britain agreed to an EU embargo on arms sales to the Indonesian government last month , three British Hawk warplanes were delivered secretly to Indonesia . #% They should be allowed to continue to work during treatment , if that is what they wish to do ; but , if not , to be able to resume their careers afterwards . #% The result will be an enhanced safety culture and that is to be welcomed by all . #% Soon we will remember the victims of the London bombings . #% So we have a whole range of measures on both sides of the equation . #% The recycling plants required to meet this directive are highly capital-intensive . #% Lastly , on the issue of plant-based infection , maybe that has something to do with the increase in organic food consumption where I understand you are 30 times more likely to get e-coli infection . #% But do not saddle the rest of Europe with unenforceable limits just to solve a particular problem that the German and Austrian authorities might have . #% On a report like this it is necessary to get a very large majority in order for Parliament to speak with authority . #% I congratulate the Commission on these proposals , which have started the debate on how a common asylum policy should be shaped . #% But overall the agreement is weak . #% That makes us a key player in the market and with key responsibilities to the coffee-producing countries . #% We ask the Commission to provide us with a report on the possible involvement of European oil companies in abuses committed against local communities in the oil - producing areas . #% We will not support it . #% It is something that will not go away and as each week passes it approaches quicker and quicker . #% The issue of the identification of beef products and the certainty that they can be relied upon is as much at the heart of the dispute between France and the European Union as it is at the heart of the concerns of safety which have preoccupied both the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment over the last two years . #% It is time to break that stranglehold of the past and to create a rule of law that applies to all people in all communities . #% I voted in favour of those amendments that were designed to protect the interests of my constituents in Gibraltar . #% The effect , as predicted , has been increased use of environmentally unfriendly lignite-fuelled power stations , an increase in electricity prices and a cut in Bulgaria 's electricity exports : in other words , both economic and environmental damage . #% 
Very little progress has been made towards a resolution of the frozen conflict in Transnistria - a problem which goes back some 17 years . #% Today we are discussing Angola and , according to the World Wildlife Fund , this deal will strip a vulnerable African coastal community of a precious asset . #% I have often said in this Chamber that fish unfortunately do not swim separately and very often , when one species of fish is caught , others also swim into the nets . #% Let us work for a good solution that we can defend rather than working for a solution this afternoon , or this week , or this month . #% Equally , it reports persecution of journalists in North Korea . #% I should add that there is a report in the German press that the PKK cease-fire is over . #% Mr President , like others I welcome these reports on combating ship-source pollution . #% There is a problem of missing children across Europe so the missing children bureau is an extremely good idea . #% There has been an interesting debate about whether this should be a directive , which is binding , or a non-binding instrument . #% I really can not believe that . #% Mr President , why do we in this House continue to bring ridicule on ourselves by promoting such egregious measures as this one ? #% That recital concerns the voluntary initiatives to help companies report what they pay governments around the world in the extractive industries . #% The tenor of this debate will be set by the degree to which we can also preserve our humanity and life in all its infinite variety . #% Insisting on bottling at source is a well-meaning and naive attempt to protect jobs and the reputation of the wines from particular wine-growing regions . #% I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office and encourage him to stick to his guns in the face of all the persiflage which comes from those who claim to be concerned about duty-free . #% I am glad that the President-in-Office understands the great hardship this has caused a number of companies . #% Firstly , on children and armed conflict , we welcome the emphasis on children 's rights . #% There is no justification . #% I am glad we have moved back to the weekly measurement granted by Member States if they so deem necessary . #% Unless this directive has clarity , it will not work . #% One of its key aims is to remove American involvement in European security . #% It just led to antagonism and suspicion . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for her kind words and offer my sincere congratulations to her and to Commissioner Liikanen for this White Paper . #% I hope he can answer . #% Are we really happy about those arrangements and does Tampere really address them ? #% Thankfully , the initial opposition of the Socialist Group and the European People 's Party , together with concerns about legal uncertainty , were overcome . #% I am also keen to acknowledge that in the Outcome Document they make a very clear link between security , development and conflict resolution in the measures that they take . #% Mr President , I should like to raise the question of Zimbabwe . #% Bulgaria 's accession process has so far been characterised by commitment and good faith on all sides and a shared determination to meet the many deadlines involved . #% Sadly now , and as a result of this , many Britons , including politicians , think it is time for the UK to review its membership of this organisation and its very intrusive court . #% The naturally cautious British Conservative position is that , although the euro may be an added convenience to travellers and improve price transparency in the single market , it is undoubtedly intended primarily to bolster pan-European identity as a stepping stone to further political integration - something admitted to by everybody bar Mr Blair and our Labour Government - and to control not only of monetary policy , but also of taxation . #% In the light of the Amsterdam Treaty and the work in Parliament by Mr Avgerinos , for example , on improving the way we deal with urgencies , we have to try to make a fresh start on human rights and to have a trialogue between the Council , the Commission and Parliament where we can sit down and start to define where we are going on human rights and how we can improve the administration of human rights . #% That is why the turnout in the European elections in June was down to a record low . #% I hold no brief for the way the British press is reacting , nor for the rather uncertain reaction of the United Kingdom Government , but I believe that the original decision to allow full free movement was and is economically , politically and morally right . #% I too was in Washington recently and took part in the rather heated discussion which members of the delegation had with members of the United States Congress . #% This is indeed encouraging . #% However , in this case it would have been quite legitimate and I fully understand that . #% Public service is more important than private profit . #% As co-legislator , the Member States should come together and sign up to the register so that we can deliver a truly transparent legislative process . #% Belarus is the missing piece of Europe 's democratic jigsaw puzzle , and I long for the day when it rejoins the European family . #% I can only endorse what my colleague Mrs Buitenweg has said , on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee . #% We are now discussing this question despite assurances that the Lisbon Treaty did not constitute a fundamental change . #% I am very grateful to all those who have contributed to what has been an extremely good debate . #% Perhaps I could warn people like the UK Government that bailing out banks to the tune of 50 % of their entire reserves is fundamentally wrong . #% It is designed to maintain the European Union ' s necessary control over the reconstruction programme and to safeguard its independence and right of initiative in the process . #% Alternative development opportunities for producers of drug-linked crops in developing countries are too often jeopardized by unfavourable macro-economic policies imposed directly or indirectly on those countries . #% We now have a very clear definition in Article 3 ( e ) , and the final sentence of that article is a catch-all : drivers who are not caught by the checklist of criteria included in the definition will be dealt with as though they are employees under the directive . #% The new programme will be called IDABC . #% After all , the ombudsman is in the front line of dealing with the complaints and concerns of citizens . #% British Conservatives were in favour of making sure that we have free commerce in the European Union . #% It is deplorable that the Council has not seen fit to designate Hizbollah as a terrorist organisation . #% Neither of these have been fulfilled in this particular case . #% So surely it is the extensification payment that should be altered , not this 90-animal ceiling . #% Saddam Hussein is causing the suffering , as he has done from the day he came to power , and it is entirely in Saddam Hussein ' s hands to lift those sanctions , by meeting the requirements that the UN are making on him . #% People should not be detained just because they apply for asylum . #% Indeed , was this the deal that I predicted back in 2005 ? #% I am of course in favour of direct universal elections to our Parliament and I congratulate the rapporteur on the hard work he has put in to increase the authority and credibility of our Assembly . #% We believe that the European institutions need to become more transparent and accountable to the electorate . #% A mishandled transition will , in particular , hamper important political developments in the region - including , it seems to me , China 's eventual membership of the WTO , which we all hope will happen sooner rather than later . #% However , we must recognise that it is not a 100 metres sprint but a marathon we are engaged in . #% Growing pension funds will dynamise our economies by providing large additional capital funds for investment not only in the EU , but also in developing markets , with greater prospects for future growth and returns on investment for our pensioners . #% We welcome the European Commission 's proposal to make 2003 the year of disabled citizens but its impact will be diminished if the Commission does not , during that same year , publish a general disability discrimination directive which offers comprehensive civil rights to disabled people in Europe , similar to the American Disabilities Act , on the other side of the Atlantic . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , if Albania is to make progress towards its eventual goal of EU accession , its political leaders need to engage in a more constructive , democratic and mature way . #% The United Nations - especially the World Health Organisation - is now fully engaged and is using its specialist skills to excellent effect . #% If this was the intention there would be no need to set up the separate structures which largely exclude the Americans and Canadians and marginalise reliable European allies such as Turkey . #% The Members of this institution should feel a strong obligation to the taxpayers of Europe , for it is their money that is pouring through the holes of the colander . #% 
How can we even talk about partnership agreements with these countries , given the continuing scandal of the European Union fisheries deals ? #% That brings us to Conclusion 18 of the Koukiadis report , which has already been mentioned by Mrs Gonz√°lez √Ålvarez and talks about the possibility of introducing interim protective measures which suspend actions . #% This is not helped by an overvalued euro and a one-size-fits-all monetary policy . #% The key issue of the period of the Greek Presidency is the constitution . #% Mr President , I share your deep concern at the upsurge in violence which has taken place in the Middle East in recent weeks , because both sides appear to have locked themselves into a downward spiral which leaves little room for dialogue and progress towards a final settlement . #% Above all , we must afford efforts to sustain those less able to cope with challenges and opportunities of life , those who live with disabilities or life-threatening diseases and poverty . #% Other sea creatures like seals and birds are also threatened by declining sources of food . #% Although the funding of these programmes of EUR 520m is well below our original demand of EUR 980m which is necessary for new Member States after enlargement , there will be a possibility of increasing this figure , following extra demands on the budget by enlargement . #% I should be grateful if that could be corrected in Tuesday 's Minutes . #% Shocking statistics show the severity of the problem . #% Having spoken to a number of experts , it seems to me that health impact assessments should be introduced for all major EU transport policies and projects so that we can understand better the potential health risks and benefits of different proposals . #% In all of these negotiations there is a substantial and obvious imbalance between the parties negotiating in terms of economic size , political power and the sheer capacity to deal with the issue . #% We think it to be only justice not to interfere with a domestic decision on legal recognition of such partnerships . #% There has been progress since October . #% They are all good , quotable examples of tangible benefits the IDA way . #% The Arab world also logged the highest rejection of authoritarian rule -- the figure in this regard was 80 % -- and was indeed the third highest in favour of gender equality in higher education . #% I want to speak from the perspective of the rapporteur on internal market strategy for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% Will the Council make every effort to try and persuade the British Government that we need to take action at the European level as well as anything else we do ? #% As far as I know , there is no adequate test to make sure that they are BSE-free . #% Why is there no genuine power sharing , and is the EU insisting that moderates in the Islamic courts must be involved in any possible solution in Somalia ? #% First of all Ukrainian officials demanded rigorous identity checks from all voters , something we do not do in Britain . #% Some say enlargement is too costly . #% The sustainability and solvency of insurance companies is a crucial issue for the reassurance of consumers on a whole range of matters . #% I agree with everything that has been said about preparing the European Union , stockpiling vaccines and antivirals , and developing a vaccine . #% It is imperative that the children 's act is not hurried . #% I can reassure him on that point . #% That is why I regret the tone of the original Nicholson report on Romania . #% In other words , it is now high time for a comprehensive overhaul of the somewhat antiquated way in which this crucial programming document is developed and debated in future . #% Finally , the UK Labour Members support cooperation in criminal matters , but have reservations concerning the reference to the ` harmonisation of criminal laws ' in paragraph thirteen , which suggests that Member States should standardise criminal law throughout the EU . #% I welcome this report because I think it is very important to keep the whole issue within the international arena . #% Let us not underestimate either the impact of aviation on the environment . #% There are four million Tamils in Sri Lanka and there are 15 million Sinhalese . #% In conclusion , I repeat , President-in-Office , let us not allow our reactions to deliver to the terrorists that which their actions can never seek to achieve . #% If we want an increase in employment we should strike the right balance between regulation and flexibility for business . #% Surely the first thing , colleagues , is that we should be putting our own House in order ; that each of us should have that simplified checklist . #% Concerning paragraph 51 , it is important to remember that we are currently in a period of reflection on the future of the Constitution and to underline that ESDP does not constitute the development of a Security and Defence Union . #% The only area that I see seriously lacking in the Viola report - but I think we can take it for granted - is in relation to communications policy . #% Where there are very sophisticated markets - indeed one of the most successfully integrated markets in the European Union - it makes no sense to apply protections designed for retail investors in equities . #% The European Union is , of course , part of the solution . #% Of course it is , but since the views of the Turkish population on Iraq are shared by most EU citizens , the EU as such should be neither more nor less popular than normal . #% I hope the Council and the Commission recognise that is the view of the National League for Democracy . #% We have had a relentless drive to achieve full safety methods in beef production in my country , quite rightly after BSE . #% Now who should pay the costs ? #% Unless we can address the problem of contamination , that can not be guaranteed . #% Should not it be in the open and will you do something about it ? #% Mr President , I wish to express my disappointment at the statement made by Commissioner Frattini , which was more a repetition than a statement . #% Mr President , the previous speaker will probably be amazed to find that I agree with everything she said . #% I fear also that , even if the United States concedes , the reforms will be wrapped up in red tape and have some TRIPS-plus features . #% This is a final safeguard to the recommencement of an approval process which has been long awaited but it can be no reason for opposing the final approval of the new 90/220 legislation we have in front of us now . #% I would ask colleagues on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety to pursue this breach of EU law by the British Government and request that the Commission investigate it . #% This might be a good time to pass that point on to the Council . #% A number of organizations - the OSCE , the European Union , the Council of Europe - have been to Tirana and have engaged the government in discussions . #% We should not in the European Union be continuing a practice of raising animals in a very cruel way of which we should be ashamed . #% The EU 's relationship with Pakistan is based on a commitment to democracy , peace and stability , trade and development and respect for human rights . #% Where the British people have been given a choice , they have rejected regionalisation overwhelmingly . #% As far as I am aware , little was done . #% We wish to make clear , however , our opposition to the creation of a European Public Prosecutor , and therefore the proposal contained in paragraph 57 of the report . #% It would be a grave mistake to concentrate - as some have done in the debate today - on only one aspect of the Lisbon process , that of structural reform . #% We must have a chance to debate this and to understand why the presidency of this House is proposing in one instance radically different changes to those proposed for the Commission . #% They are going to be , through no fault of their own , in breach of European legislation . #% Mr President , as my colleague Mr Watts has said , we very much support the principle of interoperability of road charging schemes across Europe , but I particularly want to talk about London . #% There is nothing that significantly undermines the position of the smaller groups in my report . #% There are two points I would particularly like the Commission to heed . #% The Commission does not have the facility of intelligence-sharing , nor should it have , in my opinion . #% Other cost savings which can not easily be quantified at this stage will include the reduction of transport and communication costs between Commission offices that are now dispersed . #% Mr President , I visited Kuwait recently where I met a man whose childhood friend has been killed during the assault by Iraq upon Kuwait . #% 
In view of that , I would ask that we do indeed vote on amendment nine . #% Mr President , in joining in the expressions of sympathy for the victims of the Colombian earthquake , let us ensure that the European Union provides the long-term assistance required to help people rebuild their lives . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , my thanks to the House for its patience on this , my final intervention . #% They both show that the Court of Auditors , the Committee on Budgetary Control and Financial Controllers have much to do . #% This is nowhere more apparent than in the field of interoperability : 15 different systems , different signalling systems , different power currents and an obsession at national level with working their own system to the detriment of international cooperation and to the detriment of interoperability . #% Lebanon , for example , has been in an impossible situation for years : it has been shelled by Israel and infiltrated by Syria , and both must help it now to provide stability in its own lands . #% It started life in the previous Parliament and then changed to codecision and unanimity in Council in 1999 . #% I remember sharing a platform with him at a conference back in May 2000 when he set out his concerns very clearly . #% We want reform . #% Like the original questioner , I should very much welcome from the Commission a breakdown of just how much countries will contribute to the overall economy of the EU , both in terms of expanding markets for the existing Member States and the contribution of those countries to overall economic expansion . #% Mr President , I should like to compliment the Commission on sticking with the negotiations with the USA over the last two years . #% The rapporteur can only tell us that the first formal attempt at a definition comes from the Commission . #% There are regulations , we put them in place . #% It is only the Commission that can ensure the equality of all the states . #% I do not accept that the solution is simply to reduce the number of leaks . #% There are 25 million people living with AIDS in Africa and 6 million in the new-growth area in Asia - South and Southeast Asia in particular . #% Indeed the subsidiarity and extraterritoriality issues apparent in this report are clear examples of the report itself being over-extended . #% He has done a great job in keeping all sides of this House together . #% The FSA in Britain has now proposed , through Sir John Krebs , its chairman , that we should set a limit of 15 % for the water content of what is labelled and sold as chicken . #% Business confidence fell again last month for the seventeenth month in a row and there is a collapse of consumer confidence . #% People looking for cheap labour came to the camp and chose the children they wanted . #% I am very proud of the role that we as MEPs have played in the margins of the process . #% Do we really want to take this terrible first step of regulating the press without a proper discussion of the potential consequences ? #% It also has created burdens for European managers and investors in Europe that third countries do not place on their managers and investors . #% The lead judge remarked that disabled people and deaf people are prone to carry drugs , which I thought was absolutely disgraceful . #% I do believe that Mr Blokland has produced the wrong report at the wrong time for the wrong reasons . #% It appears to be resistant to treatment by antibiotics , to have a variable development and not necessarily to follow the course one would expect in terms of the vulnerability of the patients concerned . #% No deadlines have been met by the Sudanese . #% It is a serious problem and it is a problem that you have to address . #% I would therefore suggest that Member States should also consider funding that outside the context of the Seventh Framework Programme . #% People are increasing their mobile phone usage ; parents are buying mobile phones for their children ; people are switching to mobile phones . #% Once again we are here , this time to seek to highlight the ` patriotic education ' campaign conducted in Tibetan monasteries . #% Nevertheless , we strongly oppose the second part , in particular Amendment 58 , which intends new labelling requirements to be introduced at Union level . #% The Commissioner needs to address that . #% I am very pleased to see the President-in-Office here , as a former Member of Parliament . #% My main plea is that since a treaty change was required to bring us here in the first place , surely we can all lobby in our political parties , our Governments , to get a treaty change to take us away and spend the money on something useful that the people would appreciate . #% It must be said that from our side we believe that the rapporteur is playing petty party politics with the whole question of discharge for 1996 . #% It is time , as Mr Deva suggests , to challenge the orthodoxies and abandon the prescriptive notion that free flows of finance and information and trade advance welfare in all cases . #% What have we actually achieved after nine years ? #% Thanks to the carbon credit , Corus can no longer afford to employ over 5 000 steel workers , including suppliers . #% That means that we must have an enforceable code common to all of the institutions . #% Third , to rule out nuclear power as any kind of so-called solution to reducing CO2 emissions . #% To achieve the latter we need LEADER type programmes to assist small-scale enterprises to develop new jobs in high technology as well as in tourism , traditional crafts and skills and environment-enhancing projects . #% Future generations will never forgive us if we turn our minds away from those who have suffered such terrifying atrocities and who continue to suffer as I speak . #% We want regulators to cooperate and they are increasingly doing so . #% We are insistent that the parliamentary budget must deliver value for money for the European taxpayer and we are , therefore , supportive of the rapporteur 's report . #% I can send him a statement from the assay offices in Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia , which are seriously concerned about this proposal and are alarmed that the Italian Presidency is pushing for a conclusion to this directive before they have a chance to accede to it . #% Mr Blokland said earlier that we need to be harder and firmer . #% We should have an independent unit seeking to assess exactly what the impact of the legislation is , with a rigorous cost-benefit analysis , as Mr Ford has said , albeit not to substitute for decision-making , but to ensure that all decisions taken by Parliament are informed . #% I do not want to anticipate the report of the committee of inquiry but before the committee first met four papers were already written which made it clear that the present systems are in crisis . #% Up in the gallery , listening to you and me , are visitors . #% Madam President , speaking as the constituency MEP for a dozen former and existing Guant√°namo Bay residents , I welcome that at last we are hearing a squeak of protest about Guant√°namo Bay from EU Foreign Ministers . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the fate of the people of Tibet and their remarkable Buddhist culture remains uppermost in the minds of those of us in this House who believe in human rights . #% I ask the Commissioner to confirm that we might expect from the Commission some specific work in the research programmes of the European Union ( things which both the Commission and the European Environment Agency do directly ) , using her considerable influence to encourage both industrial and theoretical research in this area ; and secondly , that she might consider , with her colleagues in the Commission , a review of how this threat impacts not just on the Environment Directorate but across a broad sweep of Commission proposals and activities . #% So what have been the priorities of the European Union in the last 12 months in terms of spending ? #% As has been said during the current SARS outbreak , the virus had its own rage to survive . #% Yet this programme is about investing in our future , investing in young people who will become , as we have heard today , the Europeans of tomorrow . #% They are now creeping up the food chain to the point where our children are now starting to ingest amounts of these toxins that are beyond those that are recommended by the World Health Organisation . #% Imagine if Turkey joins the European Union : we can expect not just 72 million Turks to have automatic right of entry to European countries and Britain , but floods of refugees from places such as Iran and Iraq might cross the border into Turkey and then seek resettlement in Europe ! #% The extension of European Union competence into the defence field accentuates the need for improvements of the working of the Council . #% Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens , where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities . #% Nevertheless , I agree that the French Football Federation put on a wonderful feast of football . #% However , I thank those of you who have stayed . #% Thus eCall is the first building block in the Commission 's Intelligent Car Initiative . #% It strikes me that the European Union is creating a further quango which , like most authorities the EU sets up , will be expensive to run and turn out to be a white elephant . #% In Europe today we still see animals suffering agonies and animals dying in transit as a result of the inhumanity of transport conditions . #% 
¬∑ we do not agree with the report 's criticism of US policy towards the International Criminal Court , neither do we share the report 's enthusiasm for the Court which might so easily become a political instrument , render our own government and military personnel vulnerable to mischievous action , and whose jurisdiction over real human rights abusers such as terrorists is unclear ( paragraphs 155-160 ) ; #% For too long the European integration process has carried on as a project of the political elite . #% The key is clearly that the mechanism is crafted so that it can , in future , be fully incorporated into the Union system . #% Mr President , the Summit was indeed historic , especially regarding defence and enlargement , if not the IGC . #% We are setting target values that , by their very nature , will be almost impossible for many Member States to meet in certain given circumstances during the year . #% That is the sort of basic standard we should expect in the future , if this goes through . #% I feel sorry for Commissioner Liikanen who is being treated rather like a tennis ball , being lobbed backwards and forwards between Parliament and Council , trying to resolve an issue which is not of his making but of the Council 's . #% Let me make a special reference to Aung San Suu Kyi , now on hunger strike in Burma . #% On reform issues , we regret that the Secretary-General will continue to be micro-managed by the member states of the United Nations . #% That is why it is important to agree on a Constitution and then move on and look at how we benefit EU citizens . #% Israel , for its part , now that it has accepted the Roadmap , must give Prime Minister Abbas the chance to show his commitment to the peace process . #% Petitioning is a way of getting issues onto the floor of this House . #% No older animals over 30 months of age enter the food chain . #% This would , of course , have been anathema to Member States , so they decided instead on strict spending , borrowing and inflation limits in Dublin in 1996 as an alternative . #% In committee we agreed that the procedure for applying to conduct a clinical trial had to be looked into very closely . #% Amendment No 7 relates to sea fishing . #% The International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that the possession of nuclear weapons is contrary to international law , and this was reaffirmed by a Scottish court in 1999 . #% Companies will not bring products to the market if they think that at the stroke of a pen their product will be removed from the market . #% That brings me back to where I started . #% However , it is to be deeply regretted that so many of my group 's amendments were rejected at the committee stage of this report . #% They are then allowed to replace this trawler with a new one on the same licence , so they get two trawlers full for the price of one . #% On specific issues , I believe we have been able to persuade the Council of the need for greater reflection on whether to include domestic projects . #% Finally , you will not be surprised to hear that I wish to stress the importance of the latter part of paragraph 40 . #% I am increasingly certain that we will improve this with a substantial majority this week , but we want to get on with that . #% This oral question is born out of a frustration , a frustration that the law is being deliberately flouted and that as yet , the Commission has failed to bring Member States to book . #% Sadly , many leading politicians give in to the temptation to criticise judges for judgments they do not like . #% Some of the agencies have told us that they can not compare the work done by their staff with that of the end-user company 's staff as their agency staff do unique work which is highly skilled and is on a project basis . #% The Council may have to have a rethink on that unless it comes forward with a better idea which we have not yet thought of . #% It is essential , therefore , that at first reading we establish the principles of the legislation so that at second reading we can indeed push through a proper liberalising energy package . #% Above all we have to show the people that Europe is working in a friendly way : supporting them , not smothering them , giving them more freedom to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of those close to and around them , and to achieve their aspirations in the medium and long term . #% Part III , at least , is going to be subject to a technical revision : such technicalities as how to vote in the Council , the technique of voting by QMV or unanimity . #% Mr President , you do not have to be an implacable opponent of GMOs - and I am not - to challenge the undiluted advocacy of them in this report . #% We have , on the committee , made a number of compromises , as regards both the timetable and the substance . #% This morning I spoke with Mr Berenguer , the shadow rapporteur , who I believe can now confirm that he is content with what I am suggesting , i.e. that we should vote against the second half of Amendment No 3 and against Amendment No 6 . #% Let me just make three key points . #% Who are their constituents and how can they possibly benefit from narrow , single-issue-driven campaigns ? #% Fishing and farming have been subjected to its most tried and tested policies : policies tested almost to destruction . #% The Council will continue to look for ways to improve its report . #% In today 's global economy there is mounting evidence that multinationals registered in the north , the majority of them within the European Union , are actually causing harm in developing countries . #% In the event of an accident , it is not the captains of these ships who need a custodial or prison sentence ; it is the owners , those who are really responsible . #% Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to be able to present to you today the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ' s own-initiative report on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union . #% I am pleased tonight that Members on all sides of the House have supported the principle of a legally-binding convention . #% I am concerned that the common position says it has accepted Amendment No 5 , but that once again disabled people have dropped out of the text . #% This enlargement shows that the Cold War is finally at an end and we should remember that in those revolutions of 1989 and 1990 , a number of people died to have the freedom to join organisations like the EU . #% Political systems can subjugate wills and extinguish individuality but they can never quench the desire to be free . #% The early approval of the single programming document is essential in this respect . #% As an MEP , I represent the area of Yorkshire and the Humber , hit , as Ms McAvan said , by floods last summer - cities , villages across our region devastated . #% The conclusion may be that we will have to live with the existing Treaties for ever more because it is now impossible to change them . #% The fate of this remaining substance is still hanging in the balance . #% Sadly , we have had instances on our railways recently where some standards have not been what they should be . #% That should be covered by the 2000 Employment Directive on anti-discrimination in the workplace - we have done that in the United Kingdom . #% I also particularly support the role of Russia as our strategic partner . #% Mr President , reduction of air pollution and , in particular , benzene and carbon monoxide is a legitimate objective of the European Union . #% Within three years , and a dollar crash , the Mark was back to DEM 1.57 during December 1987 . #% Unilateralism with a reason is just about comprehensible . #% Mr President , I do not want to repeat what other Members have said , especially my colleague , Mrs D√ºhrkop , but I should just like to give a warning in relation to two of the reports you have in front of you . #% With such a host of alarming reports on food safety , it is imperative to protect Europe 's people and our safety standards in food . #% He might have intended it as a joke but I do not think that in the European Union of 2001 we should joke about things like that . #% The system failed and we are all duty-bound to put it right . #% On the matters of substance , the projects referred to in the Green justification are not military projects . #% Madam President , it would be helpful if the President of the Commission could listen to what I have to say . #% I do not imagine that there is very much freedom of opinion in those areas dominated by the PKK . #% There appears to be recognition across the board that the existing battery cage system has got to go . #% This time Parliament can not absolve itself of responsibility for the outcome of the IGC . #% Mr President , like everybody else , I too would like to pay tribute to our two rapporteurs for their cross-party working . #% Where there is a measure of derogation built into this , all of the Member States seem to be reasonably happy with it . #% 
The reality is that we know there was resistance , even amongst some Member States , towards the implementation of these measures . #% I believe that will meet all Members ' concerns . #% Commissioner Bolkestein , who launched two sets of infringement proceedings against the UK Government over the regulation of Lloyd 's , regularly tells us that his responsibility is only to bring a Member State into compliance . #% The United Kingdom , with its historic links , will play a key role in this development . #% Europe has an opportunity here to move the agenda forward by telling the world that we embrace the prisoners ' document and that we will deal with the Palestinian Government . #% As a part of the EU Single Market , they have access to over 370m potential customers - over 6 times more than in Britain alone . #% They must continue the processes which they have been going through and show patience whilst they are going through the negotiations . #% He says we must ignore them , we must continue . #% I realise that I am wasting my breath in speaking about this here , since most of you could not care less about preserving the democratic powers of the nation state . #% I think it is very relevant that the present socialist United Kingdom government is committed to ensuring that the Charter is non-justiciable and does not extend beyond existing rights to those not currently contained in the treaties . #% Therefore , our Group felt it would be useful for Parliament to take this opportunity to pass a resolution on this issue so that the Council and Commission are unable to forget what Parliament has asked for in the past . #% In addition to the negotiations , which are taking place as we speak in Abuja between foreign ministers of the Commonwealth , there are a number of European Union initiatives including the intended visit to the southern African countries by the Belgian Foreign Minister , representing the Presidency and Mr Solana , the high representative . #% Unsolved murders of journalists and human rights defenders to politically-motivated show trials with acquiescent judges say it all in my view . #% This is a black day for Europe . #% We need to do more to revive our coal-mining communities . #% If the Irish people say ` no ' for a second time , then we simply have to respect what they say , and you have to go as President of the Commission . #% We hope you will also identify ways in which you would like more support from this House in what is for us an absolutely crucial development for the future of the Commission and indeed for the future of Europe itself . #% In this regard it is imperative to remove the farcical rule that says that a doctor is working when he is asleep in bed purely because , technically , he is on call -- but then , common sense is not a capability that this Parliament often utilises . #% However , we recognise the difficulties he faced with certain governments . #% The same principles apply , although again this will need to be looked at and phased in . #% If they bought their allocation of four tickets each for a major match and sold them on the black market , they had enough money for two of them to take a two-week holiday in Australia . #% So let me say once again , we have achieved a great deal . #% I wish to congratulate the Commission this year on having got its annual economic report together rather more coherently and rather earlier than last year . #% I am not reproaching them , but I am accusing the Council and Member States of being guilty of creating a lot of hot air and rhetoric about the EU as a beacon of human rights without delivering the results . #% I am very glad to say that in the Commission the staff unions , or a majority of the unions representing Commission staff members , have gone into these issues in the most thorough detail and have actually developed attitudes and ideas that can lead to significant improvements on the original propositions and options that were put . #% Has he any comments on these reports now coming from European scientific foundations ? #% It should also see , by immediate representation to the Attorney-General , who has returned with President Kabbah , that due process is extended to the thousand people or more who have been arrested in Freetown , to avoid old scores being paid off against those who were never involved with the Koroma junta . #% In the past , millions of euros of our taxpayers ' money have been donated in aid to the Palestinian Authority with little to show for it in terms of securing a lasting peace as envisaged in Oslo in 1993 . #% At the moment investment represents 19 % of GDP . #% Mr Bourlanges 's report is , in my view , an extremely virtuoso piece of work and , I must say , as an individual , I admire it very much . #% Mr President , two years ago a young man from London named Jeremiah Duggan died when he was hit by vehicles on a motorway near Wiesbaden in Germany . #% They are long-term residents , they are not analogous to beneficiaries of temporary protection . #% But they ought to focus on what they do best and not tread upon the prerogatives of the European Parliament . #% But the complaints have been dealt with in so far as the importer or the distributor has withdrawn the product , so there is no danger consequently . #% The service said that it was not possible . #% But , unfortunately , the United Kingdom , as you know , is controlled by what we might refer to as the political undead . #% Indeed all the research from the Commission suggests that these seats are simply not safe and that no safe technology exists to secure the occupants of side-facing seats . #% I can certainly see why as a citizen of that city he made that point . #% This is a gross waste of public funds . #% In the report they are referred to as decentralized Community agencies and these second-generation agencies are going to cause us problems . #% In the Commission 's view , it is sensible to use the opportunity of current comprehensive reforms to revise the Staff Regulations in order to reflect the wide-ranging social change that has occurred in the time since the regulations were established in their present form in 1968 . #% There seems to be none , and I invite the PPE-DE to have a vigorous internal debate on this matter . #% Does he agree that it does not help to inflame the situation with ridiculous comparisons between Israel and Serbia ? #% We would like to use this brief debate to explore what Europe can do to lead the world in the absence of American leadership and in what ways the Members of the European Parliament who attend the Bonn Conference can speak for the people of Europe and actively participate in the proceedings . #% There are more similarities with the Belgian case than I think you imply today . #% Mr President , I add my congratulations and approval of this report and I praise Simon Murphy for the assiduous and sensible way in which he has crafted this proposal . #% This directive enables us to speak with one voice . #% I have been back to Bulgaria since then , as indeed has the President of Parliament . #% The real issue is the battle as old as the Communities themselves : the battle between supranationalism and intergovernmentalism . #% Finally , will he look at the competition implications in the transport business , and at the fact that within the United Kingdom the majority of railway rolling stock is manufactured outside the country , whereas other countries seem quite capable of introducing into their contracts provisions to ensure that rolling stock is made in their own country ? #% In particular , if it is to contribute effectively to the development of a single , competitive , energy market , the Agency needs more powers to tackle cross-border issues and encourage effective cooperation between transmission system operators ( TSOs ) and national regulatory authorities ( NRAs ) . #% The UK -- as has been said -- has opened access , with certain shifts on social security . #% I certainly would . #% Even where we have rights in European legislation , rights for example to be consulted well in advance about decisions on collective redundancies or other major changes affecting livelihoods , the law is not being properly observed or applied . #% Instead of creating and sustaining world class centres of academic excellence , we are destroying them through lack of funding and misconceived class-driven doctrines . #% Many of the ideas related to market share are also changing very rapidly . #% Since then we have witnessed an enormous rush in European history , from the disintegration of the Soviet Union to German unification , followed by the rush to include countries from central and eastern Europe , which will be complete in a few days time . #% Forget about creating new agencies , forget about new rules ; why are you not looking much more seriously at implementing and enforcing the existing legislation ? #% It is still happening . #% That is surely something we should be doing . #% As I understand the position , they may pose a serious threat to the market inasmuch as a number of the provisions look as if they will cut across the country of origin principle which , as the House knows , is the basis on which the single market is founded . #% I want to ask you , President of the Council , to put on your agenda a determined effort by all Member State governments to clear out the difficulties of establishing businesses across the European Union . #% We have vaccines , but it is vital to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy necessary for licensure . #% In your legal tour d'horizon you seem to imply that at some point the UK authorities had asked for my immunity to be waived - or that is how it came through in the interpretation . #% After September 11 , it is obviously more difficult to say that everyone except terrorists should be covered by its provisions . #% My second concern applies to Article 53 in the classical directive . #% 
Curiously , three IRA suspects are currently under arrest in Colombia for advising the FARC on how to conduct murderous campaigns , on which , as we know , the IRA is an expert . #% The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has presented the second report on voluntary modulation after the referral of the first report back to committee in November 2006 , under Rule 52 ( 3 ) of the Rules of Procedure . #% I would also like to join with him in the congratulations to Commissioner Mar√≠n for the efforts he has made in relation to this subject . #% When you are looking at the balance of interest , you take on board those issues as well . #% In the course of the rest of the year I can say with certainty that velocity will at least be maintained . #% On enlargement , Labour has a clear objective for the presidency and the setting of a detailed timetable for those applicants in the first wave . #% According to the website , the value of outsourcing is in increased working days . #% When we ignore the rights of 12 to 14 million legal residents , then the rights of two families are comparatively insignificant . #% It saddens me that the situation has not changed and it saddens me that so many people in this House voted for business as usual . #% This is after all a people issue . #% -- Mr President , I would like to raise the issue of the situation in the Caribbean and Florida with regard to the terrible destruction being wrought by Hurricane Ivan and indeed by the two previous hurricanes , Charlie and Francis . #% He was about to board a plane , ready to go to be presented with an award by the President of Ireland . #% The latest measure from the Commission seeks to submit regular Ro-ro passenger ferries and high-speed passenger craft to mandatory survey regimes by host states before entry into service and then at regular intervals . #% If that had been the result of physical injury at the workplace there would have been an enormous outcry . #% I hope I will be forgiven , at least on this one occasion . #% Today , as has already been recalled , is 1 April . #% There are ample checks and safeguards to prevent politically motivated prosecutions . #% The public should be informed of the sheer folly of rejecting the Constitution and of what the outcome would be for an enfeebled European Union . #% As regards the consolidation of political responsibility I do not yet envisage the full implementation of the architecture that Mr Casaca desires , though I have a lot of sympathy for it . #% I think they should come clean on that . #% However , having said that , the crucial matter is not the existence of a Charter but the proper safeguarding of the citizen , and the means by which the citizen achieves such protection today vary from Member State to Member State . #% Only with price improvement will retail customers get the good prices they deserve . #% These measures are a direct result of Member State decisions and therefore should be funded by general taxation , not by the passenger , who is already fleeced when travelling by air . #% The immediate aims of the Marco Polo Programme are improving the environmental performance of the freight transport system and also reducing road congestion in albeit a relatively small way . #% The conviction was upheld last week . #% We can then discuss this when we come to ratify the Nice Treaty a little later this year . #% These are important steps in that direction . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , we , too , have a concern about the variable labour market that we already have across 27 Member States and within those 27 Member States , but our concern is how we move away from this towards something which is more comprehensive and stronger . #% It is an SME , but has a market capitalisation currently of EUR 1.6 billion . #% It is not a blank cheque . #% If the Commission feels that further suspensions are needed , then they must be made part of a revised regulation , fully involving this Parliament and fully respecting the rights of this Parliament . #% If the words were incoherent in all languages other than German , it shows how ill-prepared the debate was in committee because we have debated all the way through on the use of those words ` European Public Prosecutor ' . #% The Commission is acutely aware of the provision long established in Nordic democracies , recently developed also in the Public Disclosure Act in the United Kingdom , and several other comparable pieces of legislation . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , may I first of all associate myself with the comments of complaint that were raised by Mr Bar√≥n Crespo . #% What is needed regarding transfer fees is a healthy dose of pragmatism and common sense . #% I wish to make a remark about the Commission reforms which , as you have said , Mr President , were the reason for the Commission coming into office . #% I would urge the Commission and the Council to take a much more comprehensive approach to rebuilding fishing communities . #% I therefore reject the allegations of Mr Donnelly . #% Let that be remembered today . #% That is why I fully support the end , with necessary safeguards , to the British opt-out from EU Working Time rules . #% So it is there , we have got to deal with it . #% It is a very good directive and I hope everyone will vote for it tomorrow , but just for artificial radiation and not for the inclusion of natural radiation . #% While I accept , of course , that individual members of the Freedom Party may well be impeccable and upstanding individuals , there is a phrase that those that lie down with dogs get fleas . #% We have a basis on which to build in order to tackle one of the great threats to freedom , justice and security in the world , including Europe . #% To conclude , I echo what my colleague Mr Karas said , that I also heard with regret this week the news that Mrs Echerer will not be standing again for this Parliament . #% Whilst the conflict was continuing in Lebanon , international attention ignored the rockets fired from Gaza and the 250 air strikes , 1000 artillery shells and over 200 killings inflicted on its people . #% Expenditure can be accepted until the end of 2001 so there is some time left to cater for the expenditure . #% It takes no account of the need for flexibility in key areas of transport , pays scant regard to the consumer and seems contemptuous of the need for Europe 's industry to remain competitive , a cornerstone of the Lisbon Declaration . #% But when it comes to the enforcement process , we still seem to be in a position where the decision to enforce or not is less than obvious - why that decision may or may not be taken - and citizens are often left wondering . #% The European Parliament behaved in a very responsible way in conducting the hearings for all six candidates . #% I would like to see Parliament be able to engage more fully . #% This is all to the good . #% We believe that this could be done ; it could be restored . #% It is quite obvious that this is some proof of what we can do . #% Those parts of the directive can , of course , be subject to derogation but only by collective agreement so those elements will apply to junior doctors . #% The war on terror must not become an onslaught on civil liberties . #% If the people who have reservations about this are not even willing to try it out for a while at the end of debates , when the President so decides , then really there is not much willingness to compromise at all . #% Mr President , we should remind ourselves as Mr Van Orden has done why we have these no-fly zones in the first place . #% rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . - Mr President , as the previous speakers have said , the development of common foreign , security and defence policies is one of the greatest prizes that is prospectively in our grasp as a result of the Treaty . #% It is just as likely that a marketing ban will prove to be `` WTO-secure '' as it will `` WTO-insecure '' . #% Too much emphasis is being placed on Italy in a theatre where history should tell us that we ought not to put the Italians into too exposed a position . #% But the truth is that neither this Parliament , nor the European Union , can not today legislate for equal rights for disabled people , because we have no legal base from which to do so . #% The reciprocity of data protection should be beyond reproach , and the manner in which the agreement has been negotiated and concluded must never be repeated . #% A Green Paper on such a code is a sick joke to the many thousands of workers who have been affected by restructuring in recent weeks . #% I urge the French Government to recognise the logic and imperative of this , though I understand they are resisting it in the Council . #% When coming to the question of the big picture -- which Mr Duff mentioned -- many in my political group believe that this involves the ability of the Union to absorb Turkey on the one side and the Turkish ability to meet those criteria on the other . #% 
I am also afraid that some of the more unscrupulous employers will make those hauliers self-employed just to get round this legislation . #% The institutions seek to minimise those errors , and they must be prepared to listen to advice on how to do that . #% Confidence is essential . #% This is a message we must make very clear to the Indonesian Government . #% Madam President , item 1 of yesterday 's Minutes states that I made clear that I had intended to vote against in most votes . #% Children have lost parents , families are bereft , hopeless , helpless and they have lost absolutely everything . #% It would bring the EU into further disrepute if we legislate against the sun in the workplace . #% It is in this context that we call for the reinstatement of the three judges removed from Peru 's constitutional tribunal . #% That is why we have reintroduced amendments to lower the entrance fee for business to be part of the Joint Undertaking . #% The deficiencies and loopholes are well known : failure to provide timely information and consultation , to fully recognise the role of trade unions , to provide expert support , the inadequacy of sanctions , the misuse of confidentiality rules to withhold information and so on . #% Let us remind ourselves who sits on the Council : national ministers , members of national governments , accountable to national parliaments - not people who are predisposed towards centralising everything in the European Union . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner whether , with the help of the European Parliament , we could try , perhaps before the summer recess , to organize a further meeting with these people , using the UK as a focal point for it ? #% Does that mean that the financial perspective would be to 2010 instead of 2013 ? #% Clearly a number of the families dependent on these teachers face the real prospect of poverty . #% I have been asked by a number of colleagues who have read the report why , if it is such a good idea , there are so many amendments in it . #% It has the potential to benefit from this increased trade and I ask the Commission to ensure that it does so . #% I am sure there are not many people in this Chamber who understand what bench-marking or peer review means . #% The question is that if a reactor is safe to run until 2006 , why is it not safe to run for its full economic life ? #% Madam President , I too welcome the Commission statement and particularly look forward to the post-2005 report about the future of the textiles industry . #% This is now seven months behind schedule . #% My own with Mr Sanga of the Solomon Islands on food aid and food security was an example of that . #% The reality of today 's industry is that every operation - every factory - has to compete for long-term investment globally . #% Freedom of short-term travel is a vital part of preparation for that . #% Mr President , my point concerns the next four hours . #% To make it more workable for Member States we would firstly like to exclude pay and other financial benefits from the directive 's scope altogether . #% I can report that in the past month a further six major legislative acts have progressed through the Bulgarian National Assembly and I am advised that key constitutional changes that we have called for will be presented to the National Assembly this year . #% We need to state very clearly that the EU calls on the US to give up this initiative and pledges itself and its Member States not to take part in this project on any level . #% Hence my positive vote . #% Arguably , that is what we should focus on more and more . #% The European model of lighter , economical cars is becoming more and more significant in the rest of the world apart from the United States . #% I have written time and time again to the significant people , that is , the President of the European Parliament , the President of the Commission , NATO and Mr Clinton . #% We have an election and I must remind the House that the State of Israel is the only democracy that exists in the region and that is something that is worth noting . #% We see this as a way of tackling unemployment , as a way of strengthening the internal market of the European Union . #% I wonder whether they would accept that there are many people who know exactly what this legislation can bring about . #% To do that would mean spending EUR 1.8 billion on recycling packaging waste alone , and packaging waste is only 6 % of the waste going to landfill in Britain . #% We would like to see the latter issue raised as a separate discussion on the basis of an oral question in the November part-session in Strasbourg . #% That is my doubt about this particular policy . #% Is it not a good thing for manufacturers to be competing on the basis of setting the highest possible environmental standards ? #% I commend this resolution , which is balanced and constructive , and I will be supporting Tunisia in the process . #% We seem to place too much emphasis on stopping people coming into the institutions . #% I would ask you as a matter of urgency to investigate whether Parliament 's rules have been broken . #% Without the ban on location clauses , we would see almost no change from the present position , because without that ban consumers would still have to travel to another country to use a non-domestic dealer . #% It is counted in billions : it is reckoned that USD 40 billion is collected in the US against European companies . #% Mr President , as a number of colleagues have said as regards consumer credit , good regulation will stimulate the market , encourage consumer confidence and stimulate innovation and development across the single market . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commission for their statements this afternoon and Mr Spencer for his report . #% I backed you in July because I thought you would be independent . #% In Amendment No 19 , the rapporteur calls for a European umbrella body to coordinate the work of national regulatory bodies . #% We have struck out the second subparagraph of Article 13 ( 5 ) and all other amendments which follow the same line of allowing imprecise mixed origins or an indication such as `` EU origin '' . #% The Delegation supports the initiatives in the recent Kirkhope report on the establishment of Joint Investigation teams in which police forces combine intelligence in the fight against major criminals . #% Should the new authority be appointed on the basis of ability and merit , through a full process of scrutiny , or should it be by the old road of quiet nomination ? #% You take a taxi journey to visit your friends and family that ends in tragedy . #% I thank them all for tackling different aspects of the subject . #% As has been pointed out , even if Parliament agrees to what is proposed in this report - an additional ECU 100m over the next two-and-a-half years - that will still be less than the Commission originally considered was necessary for this five-year programme for the twelve countries who were then Member States . #% I wonder if it is really a good use of money to put a lot into early warnings on weather , which are already really there . #% To make our position absolutely clear , we are also willing , if Amendment No 1 is passed , to support the rapporteur 's Amendment No 2 , to the effect that we believe space should be used to create peace rather than conflict . #% The time has come for Europe to realize that unless we look very carefully at the way in which we structure our homes and our families , we will reap an awful whirlwind . #% We are , in effect , experiencing convergence of content . #% I think we are very close on this issue . #% Would they want us to go back to feeding fish discards to ruminants ? #% Do we really have mutual recognition of technical standards between countries ? #% I urge Members to reject this report or , at the very least , require it to be translated from the original bureaucracy into plain language , so that we can all understand . #% Without widespread public support across the Union , such a policy would not be viable , above all at times of stress and strain . #% There are only six amendments which the House has to consider tonight : five from the committee as a whole and the sixth tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance . #% We have done similar things since 1994 , which have never been challenged by the Council , because it recognises that , at the end of the day , it is the Treaty that counts , and the Treaty gives Parliament the final say on the budget when the President signs the budget . #% The British Government must recognise the moral debt owed for crimes of slavery and colonialism and continue to do all in its power to support a peaceful and progressive settlement to the land issues in Zimbabwe . #% Now their project has run out of control . #%
