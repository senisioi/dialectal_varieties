You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka . #% The rapporteur 's suggestion that new links should be formed with the near-moribund Economic Policy Committee set up in 1974 is good , as too is the proposal that dialogue should be encouraged between the EFC and the Employment Committee created under the employment chapter of the Amsterdam Treaty . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , as every year in this major exercise , there are a few technical corrections that need to be made at this stage . #% Can I first of all thank and congratulate Mrs Pack for leading us through this process , and also the Commission for standing by in what was a hard-fought , long and , in Parliament 's view , a responsible negotiation , following which we are very happy to vote for the programme . #% Those escaping from war and torture do not need to be welcomed by barbed wire and armed guards . #% They do not need what these reports recommend , which is the export of the worst features of the European Union : economic and political integration and harmonised legislation . #% We must develop our own in-house expertise and ensure that men , women and children born equal are afforded their natural human rights and civil liberties . #% Taking these realities into account , it is clear that the success and the acceptance of the whole early retirement scheme may well depend on all institutions ' accepting budgetary neutrality . #% Firstly , excise duties have not been harmonized as promised . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply to Mr Lomas . #% We know from the five who are meeting the target that there is nothing special about 140g . #% That means basic research in laboratories and institutions , but also industrial production : for example , brewing , vaccine production and some activities in the food industry . #% I also have to say that when we were coming to this conclusion on 17 July , there was cooperation between ourselves , the Commission and , dare I say , the majority of the Council . #% I fundamentally disagree with that . #% Education is about our future , it is about having adults who are employable , who are fit , who are healthy , who are not a drain on our social services . #% North Sea cod stock recovery levels are poor and it is vital that all aspects of fisheries that impact upon it remain under the scope of the cod recovery plan . #% I am delighted to hear that the Commission is taking action on this matter because the constituent of mine who I referred to has a first-class degree at an English university in French and German , is a fully qualified teacher in the United Kingdom and has a Master of Arts in German . #% Rather , it must be used to develop a Europe built around its nation-states , taking decisions together , according to evolving systems of decision-making , which make them suitable and appropriate to a 21st-century world . #% I have to say to President-designate Barroso that if we vote the Commission down , we will not be creating a constitutional crisis . #% We need to ensure that they , like us , are able to function properly but also , at the same time , limit their spending increases for the future . #% I have already arranged for my car to leave later to go to Frankfurt airport , but I do not want to be leaving here at 3 o'clock because I will not catch my flight . #% It is most regrettable , therefore , that the opportunity was not taken by the European Parliament to support international calls for additional sanctions . #% If Mugabe does not take immediate and verifiable action in the way that the international community is demanding , the European Union must be ready at once to impose the smart sanctions . #% We can not have cooperation between Parliament and the Commission unless we have greater transparency . #% I would suggest , colleagues , that is not the choice at all . #% That was one of the reasons why I ventured to suggest that we try to merge the three and therefore , in English , we get rid of the word `` compromise '' , which is ambiguous . #% We ask the highest Libyan authorities to intervene in this matter , above all on grounds of natural justice and humanity . #% But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span . #% In my opinion , the evidence shows that it is most certainly happening in the case of Julian Assange . #% In view of the work that has been done , our job here is just to ensure that there are no political issues arising out of what is largely a set of technical amendments . #% Its original raison d'être , the serious food shortages following the second world war , no longer exists . #% Firms with a presence in all fifteen Member States face an estimated EUR 40 million a year in extra costs through having to deal with fifteen different pension providers and legal arrangements . #% NGOs also report that Internet access is routinely blocked and e-mails addressed to certain e-mail accounts never reach the intended recipient . #% I am sure there is a shared opinion across this House of how important small businesses are . #% Do they do so because of objections from manufacturers ? #% The text we adopt will specify that GM presence of more than 0.9 % of any ingredient will trigger the labelling requirement . #% The British people were lied to 30 years ago about this European club . #% If the Hague Tribunal can not do the same , then the former Yugoslavia and indeed the whole Balkans region will never move on and peace will never be guaranteed . #% Madam President , on a point of order on which I would appreciate your advice , I was told a moment ago by sessional services that this question has been withdrawn , but I understand that normally every MEP has access to the full list of questions . #% To paraphrase the commentator , Ruth Lea : because the Trade Commissioner negotiates trade deals for the whole of the EU , the brutal truth is that EU membership constrains Britain 's economic prospects . #% So essentially this is the core principle . #% But unlike many who voted against the Rothley report I did so because I believe the European Parliament should be more powerful , more influential , should play a larger role in the European Union . #% Central to each and every health system are the people working in it and for it ; having the right workers with the right skills in the right place doing the right things is fundamental to being able to address the full range of health challenges in a country . #% We did not necessarily get a lot of support from you in the beginning , but it is a lesson I hope you will take for other major industries later . #% We would point out that far from there allegedly being no code of conduct , there will certainly be measures to secure separation between types of expenditure -- between information and political expenditure -- and a code of conduct on the use of appropriations entered under this heading . #% I see in the Commission 's synthesis report no more than four or five paragraphs on this very important issue . #% Any allegations are rigorously investigated and prosecutions sought . #% I agree that third countries should set their own health rules but we should not approve of double standards . #% And then specifically , on a number of initiatives , we need to make sure that the vehicles we produce are the sort of vehicles that will be acceptable , not only in our own market , but in the United States and in the other markets around the world , and the sort of product that the consumer wishes to purchase . #% Much as we all want Serbia and Croatia to join , the Council , Commission and Parliament must be united and firm in saying that indictees like Mladić and Hadžić must be delivered and , in the case of Croatia , evidence and witnesses facilitated . #% Finally , I just wish to draw the House 's attention to the merit of Amendment No 68 concerning monitoring . #% Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable . #% We know that there is a major issue of under-reporting sharps injuries : estimates range between 40 % and 75 % and that is huge . #% However , we have abstained on this report as it is a missed opportunity to address a serious problem . #% We can be proud of our own role inside the process so far and we must not be shy of marketing Parliament on the strength of the success . #% That is what we call for in this debate today . #% I am thinking of proposals relating to the Galileo project which have military implications . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the Commissioner and thanking her for her wise , practical and helpful comments today and also for the report by the Commission , which was extremely well balanced . #% I remind you of the inextricable link between health and poverty and urge you to ensure renewed momentum on health and clean water policies , and on debt relief . #% Resolutions of this Parliament have too often been ignored by the Council . #% It is not exactly ahead of the curve to take four and a half years to make only an informal request . #% Mr President , unusually for me I can stand here and say that virtually everything has been said . #% And the chapters on thematic priorities , such as the human rights of women or human rights and business , include developments within the European Union , as well as those abroad and in multilateral organisations . #% Biodiesel is just one case where the talking has to stop . #% With effective use of the market and less advanced technology , they were able effectively to end that first attempt at common standards . #% Altogether there is a corrosive effect on expectations , breeding cynicism rather than public support for some of Europe 's most important work . #% 
But I do not dispute the fact that more efficient cars are a good idea and that working from home cuts down pollution . #% Her advice that we should go for a European tax is premature and unnecessary . #% And that , of course , includes the need for consistent testing methods . #% We aimed again to halve that number by 2015 : that means over 20 years , a reduction of 22 million a year . #% I believe in the circumstances we could not have done any better , but those three played a major role in that . #% I think it is right to reduce set-aside from 10 % to 5 % in certain areas , and hope this will be extended soon to other producers of crops which are subject to growing world shortages . #% Mr President , I should like to start by thanking Mr Paasilinna for an excellent report . #% Mr President , we all sympathise with Turkey after the traumatic experience it has been through . #% But then , to be blunt , the Council , no doubt under pressure from finance ministers , got cold feet . #% We will have many more debates with Mrs Thorning-Schmidt and other colleagues about adding to the requirements to improve the safety and health of their workers . #% My group believes that the compromise position that we reached in committee , with the help of our rapporteur , Mr Grosch , enables the directive to offer mere guidelines and therefore negates the need for subsidiarity . #% It is quite clear that we have to address exactly the same issues . #% In the year 2000 , the EU will spend less than EUR 2 per citizen on education , encouraging young people to participate in exchange programmes or to acquire knowledge of different languages and cultures , on informing its citizens about the future developments of the Union while supporting our audio-visual industry . #% We are particularly pleased that the two approaches represented by the differing sides of the debate in our committee - on the one hand wishing to retain a methodology to distinguish cogeneration from other forms of generation , and on the other hand wishing to maintain an accent on energy saving - have been retained in the famous Annexes two and three , and that some accommodation between those two perspectives has been reached . #% This accident has once again highlighted the issue of seat-belts in buses , especially those carrying children . #% We , too , will apply a single currency in a single market in our singular Europe . #% After all that , with your expanded waistlines , the plan is that you go back to your home countries and tell people that all is well with this club that you have agreed to join . #% My group will re-table certain amendments that were put to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to try to take matters forward even further , to make the systems that we are going to put in place more readily available and open to practitioners . #% It also , interestingly , breaches the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , in that it encourages discrimination against young lesbians and gay people . #% Firstly I want to thank all the colleagues who have been involved in this and the very many civil society organisations that have also contributed . #% What has happened in Fiji is nothing less than a coup d'état by the military industrial complex . #% The PSE Group is pleased to support this report and to congratulate the rapporteur . #% It could have been worse had it limited night-time driving , but I was delighted that the rapporteur finally saw reason and this proposal was removed . #% I think there is quite a lot of resentment among Members on this issue and I would ask that this be sorted out , so that questions appear in the order in which they are submitted and there is some fairness . #% It would be a major achievement if we could see that . #% I have been told by constituents that they have been invited to advertise their business for no costs only to receive a large invoice with legal threats not long after . #% I hope Parliament will be able to restore these cuts , but how can these be priorities when the Council is not following through on the financial commitments ? #% More than 13 million people now have Internet access in Britain and revenue from e-commerce is expected to top GBP 10 billion next year . #% We think you should go further and I would just like to echo what my friend Mr Garot said which is that Europe most of all owes you its solidarity . #% It turns out that , instead of investigating the claims that the BNP had received such material , the police have obtained an injunction imposing a ban on the showing of the videos , which I understand , but also on the reporting of the fact that BNP is making such claims and even on the fact that an injunction has been obtained . #% Mr President , on item 8 of the Minutes , the order of business . #% I am concerned that the development of non-legislative instruments should in no way be seen as an alternative to maintaining and improving Community legislation on occupational health and safety . #% I am told that these sorts of things are technical issues and that we in Parliament should remain above them , but to me the issues that will be discussed in the macroeconomic dialogue that have been touched upon here are not technical , they are highly political and we , as the democratically elected institution , should have a part to play in that macroeconomic dialogue . #% Until Member States jointly agree a solution to the staffing problem in the Commission , resolutions in favour of aid quality will go little further than the paper on which they are written . #% I should like to raise two points with him . #% In conclusion , we do not want a cure-all for unemployment . #% My group supports the idea of creating a new judicial procedure of constitutional complaint for breaches of competency , which implies the rapid evolution of the European Court . #% By taking some action to secure a kind of out-of-court settlement , it seems that the European Union has made concessions not compatible with the principle of the WTO . #% If that had happened anywhere else in the world we could have expected immediate condemnation by the international community . #% Its involvement is essential , given its experience and expertise . #% The moratorium therefore must stay in place . #% I will be quite happy to convey your point of view to Commissioner de Silguy . #% In the face of such breathtaking arrogance , nobody in the Independence and Democracy Group will vote for this Commission . #% These priorities must be focused to reflect the new challenges lying ahead . #% The promotion and defence of human rights is a high priority for the European Union and remains one of the fundamental principles of the Union . #% The committee also proposed that there should be greater partnership at Member State level in determining and evaluating how the money should be used , including the involvement of refugee organisations themselves . #% This achieved near-unanimity in the committee , because we have been unhappy with the way OLAF has been reporting to the budgetary authority , in many cases contravening its own rules . #% I would support the Commission 's proposal on civilian crisis management and oppose the Council 's clear intention of cutting Parliament and the Commission out of that . #% In recent years the Petitions Committee has developed the possibility of inviting petitioners to attend committee meetings , where appropriate , to have their petition addressed . #% If we do not find ourselves properly consulted and informed , where does that leave national parliaments and citizens ? #% Not only has that country , which is a brutal , secretive , communist dictatorship , repeatedly violated international agreements such as the 1994 one to end its bomb-making uranium enrichment programme , it has also in the past violated every standard of civilised behaviour , from kidnapping Japanese civilians - which the government justified , almost unbelievably , on the grounds of needing language instructors for its spies - to engaging in political assassinations such as blowing up the South Korean cabinet in Rangoon a few years ago . #% Now I am reciprocating as shadow for his report . #% Throughout the extensive voting the following principles were followed : #% I therefore request that the matter be referred to the committee responsible . #% It must take some action . #% In supporting some parts of the Kirkhope report we recognised the complexities of the issue and will continue to work for a full and comprehensive common asylum system for the European Union , one that has humanity and the interests of the most vulnerable at its core . #% The reality is that the Union has a solid set of achievements to its credit , but with shortcomings . #% We also need more commitment about the portfolios given to newly appointed commissioners and a clear explanation from Mr Barroso about the organisation of the next college . #% These people have not been able to exercise their freedom of movement because they can not afford to . #% This is more a process during the life of the financial perspectives than simply in the 2007 budget . #% Twenty years ago , I , myself , was a member of my local young farmers ' organisation in the county of Somerset in England . #% I understand the problem but this is not the solution . #% This report clearly demonstrates that conflict can be avoided inside companies . #% The drive for privatisation has also been part of a drive to reduce costs in the public sector and this has often resulted in wage squeezes that have hit the lowest paid . #% I totally agree that structural change is here to stay and indeed it will accelerate . #% I am sure that the Commissioner will agree that these are exactly the kind of figures that will help to stimulate the economy and create jobs , not only throughout the United Kingdom , but also in India . #% 
I look forward to the implementation of this directive in Member States as another positive move in our campaign for maritime safety . #% These I will tackle now because I believe these points are what people want to hear about . #% I am not known for agreeing with him regularly but I congratulate him on the intensity of what he said which set the meeting off to a very good start . #% So , with those reservations I congratulate the Commission and the President-in-Office and look forward to an improvement in human rights in the coming year . #% A report about the struggle against Shell was found on the back seat . #% I have therefore retabled an amendment to make this merely a recommendation to Member States . #% Our inquiry is about the EU aspects of this case . #% That brings me to my final point . #% Madam President , I have no comment to make . #% We must also be certain that all arrangements with third countries are mutual so that we too can benefit . #% Madam President , I rise in support of Mrs Berès ' report and want to draw just two or three points from it . #% I should like to point out to the House that significantly more jobs are being lost in four plants in the United Kingdom as a result of this closure than anywhere else . #% The Ombudsman has proved to be a serious , assiduous and determined person committed to protecting the rights of the people of the European Union . #% I also agree with the aspiration to implement the accord in as near parallel with the United States as possible , to prevent the banking sector in the European Union from suffering a competitive disadvantage . #% As we say , the devil is in the detail . #% We did , in an amendment , stress the importance of the Middle East peace process to getting a solution across the whole of the Middle East and peace across the region . #% At that time I had the privilege of writing the report for Parliament with my friend across the floor - Mr Whitehead - acting as shadow . #% My own view is that we should have a free vote on this , because it seems to me that those in the House who wish to take the codecision route have a right to vote for it . #% Mr Goebbels says we will raise growth by promoting competition , enterprise , entrepreneurship , initiative , and risk-taking , particularly among small - and medium-sized enterprises . #% Will the Commissioner act upon these proposals ? #% Of course people can not be allowed to bring in anyone they wish , but reunification of close family is important . #% It may well be that additional support can be given through the TENs programme and I look forward to my discussions with the Commissioner on this extremely serious development . #% That is why we not only support the move away from small vertical programmes to horizontal strands but also seek a vastly more integrated approach , based around an identifiable single health directorate so that health truly becomes an integral part of the EU process , at its very heart . #% I still believe that the carrot of EU membership has proven the great driver of economic and political reform . #% But we are delighted that it is part of our family again . #% People are asking themselves how they can improve their living conditions for themselves . #% Centralised , the European Union ? #% How can BP deny that it has passed photographs of protesters into the hands of the military , only to see those same people arrested or murdered when this leaked Human Rights Commission report , signed by four key Colombian Government officials , appears to show and confirm those same allegations ? #% That is a role for the JPCs . #% Our commitment to sustained momentum is nothing to do with any desire to rush the Commission , its staff , Parliament , the Council or anybody else . #% One thing was absolutely clear . #% Mr President , I am rather concerned that I have been looking at a slightly different document from the rest of this Parliament . #% I would therefore like to request that the plenary vote to refer the report back to committee , which would give the committee the flexibility to enter into negotiations with both the Council and the Commission . #% The cost implications for feed manufacturers and farmers from such a guarantee scheme are also unclear . #% Secondly , I understand that the presidency , the Commission and the past presidency , have opened exploratory contacts with third countries about the possibility of extending it . #% Supervisors and regulators can impose higher standards of supervision on third country companies from outside the EU if they wish , rather like the Americans . #% To its credit the Council is at least represented by Coreper . #% With regard to tariff suspensions , we believe the criteria are rather over-strict , and we would like a more liberal system . #% I begin by welcoming the Commission 's proposal to integrate Europe 's convention on a high-speed rail network . #% I have to say , however , that I can not agree with Mrs Pack 's negative view of what has been achieved so far . #% Under its own terms the Constitution can not take effect until all Member States ratify it , which will not now happen . #% Article 51 of the Fourth Directive has been mentioned by two colleagues , and implementation of the Eighth Directive in all Member States also calls for more work by the Commission . #% I believe that consumers have the right to know what the products they buy are made from , and this report ensures that any animal-derived materials will be indicated on textile product labels . #% I hope that my committee will be able to do that so we can start consulting a wide range of interests in this extremely comprehensive proposal . #% The port authorities know , suppliers of services and facilities know , customers know : the only people who do not appear to know are those in the Commission . #% I am here tonight to appeal to the Commission and the Council not to retreat from that position . #% We would really like that answer . #% As a supplementary , I should like to ask you about the ` small Dublin group ' to be set up in Ankara . #% As for speed , six to eight months under the egg-based vaccines is not good enough . #% Is the European Union 's response being fully coordinated with that of the United States ? #% Contrast that with the unequivocal lectures given by the US to developing countries at the WTO meeting in Doha , to the effect that , by liberalising their markets , they will automatically reap the benefits of globalisation . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and say that the proposals on the simplification of legislation in the internal market that were launched in 1996 are very welcome . #% The declaration concerning Article 1 ( 6 ) talks about the practice followed , systematic use and consulting the securities committee when it plans to submit new proposals . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , like my colleagues here , I have been hugely frustrated and angered by the Council 's treatment of and substandard consultation with this House on the agreement . #% The results of the investigations will allow the Commission to propose if necessary the appropriate measures to be taken at European level to regulate the use of these substances in toys and in other products as well . #% This will be put to the House tomorrow morning to vote on . #% Instead , we should focus on terrorist groups and other criminal elements that are sitting on stockpiles of weapons or continuing to obtain them from various sources . #% The second area is that of freedom : freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals . #% I would like to add - unofficially in any response and consideration the Commission gives to this - the following question . #% In many respects , the Durban conference belongs to an age that came to an end on 11 September . #% Mr President , the rapporteur should be congratulated on his wide-ranging and important report and he has rightly identified the problems of transposition and application of Community law , mainly with regard to directives . #% That will not happen and can not happen under my report . #% There are two issues of absolutely fundamental importance to us as a Liberal group . #% Besides having no experience of the required tasks , she has a highly dubious past as National Treasurer of CND . #% Mr Berend suggests in his report , in the context of terrorist attacks , that the EU should be able to use the fund in such cases as a political signal of solidarity . #% Consequently , Conservative MEPs have abstained on the final vote . #% 
This Chamber looks like the Supreme Soviet , apart from the flags . #% But it is true that many of our hopes , for example , in the field of employment and of life-enhancing technical progress , centre on this particular field . #% She has done very well . #% We have to make it clear to all the parties in former Yugoslavia that they must adhere to the Dayton agreements and that we want to see the free movement of people which is being denied by the Croatian authorities in Bosnia . #% He came for two days and stayed for a week . #% If these regulations are properly implemented they could also prevent distortion of the rules of competition between the various modes of transport . #% The waves , of course , continued to lap at their feet and the King had proved his point . #% I hope that the Foreign Ministers and Prime Minister Blair will impress on their guests the need for transatlantic understanding to flow both ways . #% Mr President , at the last part-session I revealed the allegation that Romano Prodi had been an agent of some kind of the KGB . #% in writing . - The package agreed by the 27 governments last weekend salvaged many of the practical institutional reforms that were contained in the constitutional treaty . #% Just so : the first measure to be discarded is this well-meaning but artificial attempt to create social solidarity . #% I am sorry to say that other European Union countries have left the UK and the Netherlands holding the line on not ratifying the association agreements until Croatia cooperates . #% I want to say a word to Mr Jospin , and I do so in no nationalist spirit . #% It will become a zone of stability and prosperity which will improve the quality of life of all its citizens and it will become a major force for good in the world beyond its borders . #% We are therefore suggesting that the flexibility instrument could be used for this purpose as well as perhaps dealing with that commitment made in the 2002 budget to deal with the EUR 27 million on fleet restructuring . #% I think that is a major benefit that they are very pleased to have . #% I shall just run through a few of the problems that I still see with the legislation . #% If doubt hangs over their entitlement to structural funds , that is the fault of national governments . #% Kashmir is a region divided by history and has become a cause of conflict , which has been perpetuated at times by government and militant action on both sides of the Line of Control . #% I congratulate the Commissioner on the lead he is setting for greater efficiency not only in aid , but also in this area . #% We want to encourage and , indeed , in some circumstances , require nation states to look at their present laws , to make sure that they are able to investigate these abuses and bring people who abuse children in this way before the appropriate courts . #% Our criteria were competence , policy and background . #% Secondly , it was the explicit mandate of the Prodi Commission - not any other Commission - to undertake and achieve the reforms in its quinquennium . #% I am not against that lobbying - a lively parliament should welcome lobbying from all sides . #% We can not achieve this goal if we continue with policies that pull in different directions and even undermine each other . #% The report not only provides evidence of the involvement of Mugabe in these activities , but names a numbers of other senior Zimbabweans , four of whom are subject to the EU 's restrictive measures but four of whom , to my astonishment , are not . #% When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September , I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission 's reform proposals . #% First , to make explicit what is already implicit in the proposal . #% As the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council said , there will be major changes as a result of enlargement , as well as activity-based budgeting . #% I hope I have the support of all colleagues in the House in saying that we still consider this the centre-piece of the reforms and we do not see any reason why Parliament should not follow a similar line to that being taken by the Commission in this crucial area . #% State aid gets a bashing in this report , as you would expect , but the report makes the false assumption that all state aid is bad . #% I would be pleased if you can inform us about whether that is the case . #% Reproductive health and family planning are also an integral part of our approach in this field . #% For tourism it is extremely important that the euro is introduced . #% Mr Barroso , whom we are delighted to see here this morning , made an important point in his principles for the promotion of good-quality public-service delivery . #% It is interesting that even the Greek Cypriots -- the lucky ones who have been promised the return of their homes -- seem to oppose the plan . #% Doping is a scourge that has to be dealt with . #% Harmonise that message ! #% I hope also that this report will act as a springboard for the year 2003 , the Year of Disabled Citizens , but hopefully we can bring forward the disability directive that Mr Howitt has just referred to within that year , so as to actually make a commitment to a positive disability directive . #% Nor can we be certain that pollution will respect the boundaries of the EU , however large the EU becomes . #% Moreover , when the Commissioner 's representative spoke on Euromed to the Committee on International Trade , of which I am honoured to be a member amongst other people here , he said - and I quote here directly - ` there is no question of implementing all the EU regulations ' . #% The proposals by the Commission to simplify the inspection process of these seeds are to be welcomed in principle but the Socialist Group shares the concerns of the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as a whole that there should be additional safeguards to ensure that inspections are carried out by qualified objective personnel . #% These should not only qualify for an eco-label , but be allowed to sell their products without hindrance throughout the EU in a single financial services market . #% The security forces are also guilty of violations of children 's rights . #% Mr President , the issue of the territorial limitations of contributory infringement is the reason why software product claims were originally written and permitted by the European Patent Office . #% I said that I wanted to look at the impact of the directive as a whole , because we should be thinking particularly about small and medium-sized businesses , which are constantly frustrated at their inability to access the internal market at the moment . #% What we have in this document is a fair and balanced report on the terrible devastation and suffering the disease brought to my country . #% It will provide jobs in expanding industries which is the only sure guarantee of future prosperity . #% It also means no offence can exist that is not an offence in the UK : xenophobia , for example , can stand as a charge in the UK . #% They deserve to know that Europe 's politicians are prepared . #% I believe it would be a big mistake to ring-fence the frequencies currently used by broadcasting services by insisting on their exclusion from any new approach to spectrum management . #% I would like to be able to say that all the amendments now being redebated here will go through to conciliation , though I rather doubt it given the majorities that are needed . #% Furthermore , whilst we wish to protect the rights of unmarried and same-sex partners , we can not allow a situation to arise where the unmarried partners of EU nationals could have greater rights to enter a Member State than the nationals of that country . #% We travelled by road from Croatia into the state of Bosnia . #% So what of the Lisbon Treaty which speaks of a Union founded on respect for freedom , equality , the rights of minorities , values of non-discrimination ? #% We need these countries to work together on economic reform to boost jobs . #% Documents from third parties will be accessible for the first time and agencies or bodies created by the institutions will also apply the Regulation . #% All those opposed to racism in Europe must unite together against this new wave of hatred and intolerance . #% Furthermore , I would submit that the points they have raised are ones that in many cases have not even been flagged up by their own governments at the start of the IGC as issues on which they wished to have some discussion in that forum . #% We are deeply grateful for the work that takes place there and for the opportunity that the Assembly provides , uniquely in the world , for Palestine and Israel to work together . #% However , my Conservative colleagues and I have serious doubts as to where this paper would lead us , with its severe implications for the entire transport industry . #% All too often , in these institutions , there is a massive incoherence between European trade policy on one hand , and European development policy on the other , with trade concerns all too often undermining development objectives . #% We can not continue with a situation whereby citizens of a Member State enjoy rights under their own national law which are less favourable than those they enjoy as EU citizens in other European countries . #% It is important that CSR , as a subject , should not be seen as a catch-all for everything that everyone wants businesses to do better . #% This report confronts us with an uncomfortable reality and we urge Member State Parliaments and Governments to investigate fully what may have been happening on their territory . #% I support EU enlargement with a wider , looser flexible Europe . #% 
Madam President , this proposal finally delivers on the 50-year-old promise to allow EU citizens and their families to reside in another Member State . #% The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will , therefore , be vital . #% When it gets to Member-State level , maybe something gets lost in translation . #% On the career structure question , it appears that people have either adopted misinformed views or been given misleading opinions . #% I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms . #% The consumer knows where she or he stands . #% I did so because although the report as amended is , as we would say in English , all over the place - some points do not correspond with others and there are contradictions left , right and centre - there are a few ( and I am sure Mrs McKenna will look at them ) but significant positive aspects to the report . #% For our own part , we must place much emphasis in the assistance we are giving on ensuring that the proper framework is established , in particular in relation to banking and the finance sectors . #% I think this is a genuine error . #% What is it about you , Mr Verhofstadt ? #% We heard from individuals about what a frustrating and ridiculous process it can be when an application is halted for a minor technical reason and nobody has the responsibility to inform the person concerned of what that reason is . #% I think he has done an excellent job of work . #% On paragraph 19 , our understanding is that the Loizidou case has now been resolved - and this should be welcomed . #% I am amazed that the larger EU states allow these anomalies to continue outside the EU but within the wider area . #% As she will understand and she was good enough to recognise both in her question and her supplementary question , in a free society , if we are trying to maintain the advantage of an interchange between the institutions and outside bodies , we must ultimately rely on the honour of civil servants as well as on the fact that they are advised and know that if they stray from the undertakings they have been required to give , they make themselves virtually automatically liable to disciplinary proceedings . #% Perhaps I will ask my daughter , Kate , if she will write a 21st-century version featuring clean air . #% Can we ask you as President to make sure that is happening with the taxpayers ' money for which we are collectively responsible . #% That is part of the frustration of our committee of inquiry . #% I understand that this amendment has Mr McMillan-Scott 's approval . #% I ask you to remember that under Saddam Hussein Iraqis had no such freedoms , no access to human rights . #% I would also like to register a note of thanks to the countless people in the United Kingdom who helped organise our visits to the various parts of the UK during the course of our investigations . #% Recent years have seen a growing awareness within Iran that this isolation was harmful to Iranian interests and leading nowhere . #% It is a signal for action , and not an argument for delay . #% One benefit of this system is that it enables the Commission to take action systematically against Member States which have not adopted national measures to implement directives before the time allowed for transposal is completed . #% Having now received that report , the Commission , as the appointing authority , will reflect on the appropriate steps to be taken in this procedure . #% To my colleague Mr Santini I would say that if his amendments 60 , 61 , 63 and 64 were in addition to the proposals in this report then I would be happy to accept them . #% I propose , therefore , that the House should vote in favour of Parliament 's legislative resolution because we have already rejected the Commission 's legislative proposal . #% Mr Blair claimed it debated the things the public wanted it to debate , but the public does not want European policies for universities when the EU has no competence in education . #% We need to encourage that , but we must make sure that we stimulate the development of those fields and that people are properly rewarded . #% Rules should always be risk-based , they should be properly costed and they should be proportionate to the harm they seek to avoid . #% Taken together , I believe these particular proposals are worthy of the support of this Parliament at second reading . #% Sucralose presents no problems : it is made from sugar , it is non-calorific , it does not lead to tooth decay or - and here let me declare an interest - to risks for those of us who live with diabetes . #% The report did , however , show that some progress is being made . #% The experience up until that point was positive , with clear benefits being brought about by this directive . #% In her report Miss Swiebel expresses her own personal views on human rights . #% So I was just expressing anxiety and concern that he is not able to be here in the chair . #% Madam President , I will not go down the road of religiosity followed by the last speaker . #% Controls of terrorist finance need joint efforts , but too much effort is focused on empowering the EU and extending its competence into new areas . #% My final note is one of caution . #% If the Commissioner did not say that , then I misheard him . #% None of the experience and sophistication that has been so painstakingly and carefully developed by NATO on both the political and operational fronts is apparent in any of these proposals . #% An apparently wealthy country like Brazil has more poor people than any other country on this planet and Europe can not be silent on this question . #% That is certainly the case elsewhere in the current Union . #% Creating more rules for EU producers to abide by will cripple them and their industry and no amount of subsidy will save them . #% Finally , one of the more close-to-home reasons for my wanting Pakistan to fight both extremism and militarisation , and to return to the rule of law , is the impact on British people of Pakistani origin , with the calls , for instance , for profiling or for visa requirements for the United States . #% I feel very strongly that it is now even more in the remit of Europe to ensure that , with increased travel , particularly by young people , we take responsibility to care for their safety and security . #% The ongoing renegotiations of air service agreements must continue so that third-country carriers can gradually be taxed on an equal basis with EU carriers . #% In the context of achieving the successful future enlargement of the EU it is essential that humanitarian conditions play a central role in the continued cooperation between the Commission and the acceding states . #% One of the specifically stated purposes of comprehensive reform is the development of strengthened administrative performance which will , amongst other things , enable the Commission to deal more effectively with changes in the current and the future Union and in the wider world . #% Could we have gone further ? #% The stepped approach which has been brought in must not be used to simply give a redefinition of working time such as removing meal breaks or time spent on call but not actually treating patients . #% Surely they have been able to compete without actually putting in a support mechanism ? #% I believe that , as MEPs , we should not have this kind of debate every time a major company closes or downsizes , so that we politicians can show that we care -- even though of course we do -- and can be ` seen to be doing something ' in each individual case , highlighting named individual companies . #% There is no final proof that they have weapons-grade plutonium available and , of course , I support the compromise resolution between a number of groups in this institution . #% In approving this decision , the committee should be ashamed of itself and , if this so-called Parliament adopts that decision today , it too should be thoroughly ashamed . #% We saw the pictures on our television sets : visitors were turned away because of the mass culling ; animal welfare concerns were being disregarded ; the fires were making a nonsense of the policies adopted by this European Union in its attempts to address the concerns about dioxins spreading in our atmosphere . #% All it will do is add yet another layer of European bureaucracy and red tape to be dealt with by a business community already suffocated by the weight of red tape . #% Our institutions are regarded with contempt at worst and apathy at best . #% Whenever I listened to him , there was a particular problem with West African cotton . #% Finally , Mrs De Palacio ' s outburst at the press conference following the hearing does not bode well for someone whose remit includes relationships with the European Parliament and , whilst I accept that Mrs De Palacio did apologise later for her remarks , it nevertheless raises another doubt about her ability to carry out this specific role in the new Commission . #% Large amounts of CAP funds are already available for EU farmers . #% In order to make a significant contribution to closing that gap we then specified the ways in which further rationalisation of activities , productivity gains and internal redeployment would enable us to meet two-thirds of those requirements from within the Commission . #% Mr President , I know of no one who disagrees with the view that environmental legislation should be enforced equally and effectively across the Union . #% At this time when the future of the world is at stake , we need honesty , courage , determination and nerve to enable the international community to act together . #% In view of current concerns over the health risks on long haul flights , such as deep vein thrombosis , this report comes at a fitting time . #% This year I shall be drafting a report on the monitoring of Community law and therefore feel very passionately that in moving to codes of conduct we have to ensure we still have legal certainty and enforceability or we fragment the very gains we have made in the internal market . #% 
It is the last time , Commissioner Wallström and I will face one another here in the Chamber and I just wanted to put on record , if I may , that I and Parliament have never doubted your commitment to openness and transparency . #% On the question of payments , we have taken a horizontal approach that reflects the approach taken by Reimer Böge , as our rapporteur on the financial perspectives - whose report Parliament adopted - in outlining a number of priority areas ; and this is what we have reflected in taking payments on first reading to 1.04 % , yet again well beneath the ceiling allowed for 2007 of 1.06 % . #% I congratulate Mrs Gál on her report and I certainly believe that with the kind of assurances that I am asking for it will have a successful start and a successful period of operation . #% To begin with , and the Commission has done this fairly well - after prompting by Parliament - key barriers had to be removed and benchmarks set for their removal . #% That has not happened in some of the cases here and I appreciate the difficulties that the Commissioner faces as a result . #% Madam President , I am absolutely sure that an immediate vote of no confidence against the existing Commission would be absolutely wrong . #% That was precisely what the people did . #% Priority was given to narrow economic interests of regaining export status as quickly as possible , regardless of the devastating consequences to the wider rural economy and rural communities . #% I asked to make a short statement at the end because last Friday I was invited to participate in a conference held by the British regulator Ofcom under the auspices of the Presidency . #% That shows that technicalities can sometimes also be of the highest political significance . #% In Denmark when Galatasaray played Arsenal , a number of Arsenal fans were arrested yet not charged with hooliganism . #% I am also pleased that we have been able , if this budget is now passed , to reinstate the amount of money for e-learning , namely EUR 17 million as opposed to the Commission 's proposal of EUR 9 million . #% You could just print these off in the eleven languages and every Member will become conscious of it and we could all help to publicise this European Union facility in our Member States ! #% If , in fact , they can not comply with what they have agreed to , such countries are doing Green causes harm . #% The Commission has strong institutional powers , which it could use to actively drive the IPP process . #% Those concerns are particularly true in Tibet , where we continue to receive many reports of violations in particular against Buddhist monks and people who follow the Buddhist faith . #% Mr President , this Parliament has been a consistent critic of the Mugabe dictatorship in Zimbabwe , a country which , 20 years ago , was deemed to be a model for a prosperous , multi-racial African democracy . #% Therefore , this report is irrelevant ! #% I wish to refer to another call for silence under Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure . #% People used to flock there in search of work and prosperity . #% Take the overriding principle , for example , of national treatment that effectively denies poorer countries the right to promote their own national industries and economies , a right that was indispensable to most richer countries and which they used with impunity in their own development processes . #% One of the difficulties with this Regulation is that over the years we have seen the Court substituting for a lack of clarity in the current Regulation and , indeed , for the shifts in the development of social security systems within Member States . #% There is , of course , severe economic pressure on Venezuela at the present time . #% I am concerned that this inquiry will not be constructive but will be used by the Left in Spain as a stick to beat the government . #% I agree that movement has to be made on the issue of agriculture . #% Do you accept the findings of Open Europe , or do you go along with Mr Juncker 's assertion a couple of weeks ago that , with the situation in the euro being as serious as it is , you actually have to lie in public ? #% The simple fact is that we have to cut oil consumption : really cut it , not just talk about cutting it , and we have talked about it a great deal in the context of curbing CO2 emissions . #% I will not get into a theological argument about the definition of such powers . #% If you use the help section on the website , you get ` regarding suffixes on documents ' . #% An opt-out from a piece of health and safety legislation is wrong in principle . #% On the Global Health Fund , there are certainly big differences of opinion between the Commission , the Council and ourselves . #% She is a lawyer or barrister by profession and perhaps she should have declared an interest . #% These are translated into the main languages within a few days , but it is unrealistic to expect that full verbatim translations should be produced in all the languages of the enlarged European Union . #% The first one , in the first paragraph , is our commitment to making sure that enlargement takes place on 1 May 2004 . #% And here too , I would give a cautious welcome to the gradual shift within structural funding itself towards developing innovation and enterprise in our less prosperous regions . #% Both these key free trade elements have been absent in part or in whole from Palestinian export trade , particularly in textiles and in agricultural products . #% The role of short sea shipping clearly needs to be developed . #% I think immediately of the long-running and illegal ban on British beef . #% Within this timeframe we need , among other things , further action for women and older workers able and willing to stay in the labour market ; action to improve the availability of affordable and good-quality child care ; goals for reductions in youth unemployment and renewed emphasis upon life-long learning , training and improved mobility . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the Commission 's joint EU resettlement programme certainly has noble ambitions , which aim to encourage greater cooperation between national governments regarding the resettlement of refugees and asylum seekers . #% Mr President , the Commission report , which I have read in great detail , says : `` In general terms Directive 92/85/EEC has been well implemented by the Member States and this is reflected in the low level of complaints about the rights of pregnant workers received by the Commission '' . #% We would like to see those links made much more explicit . #% In this particular case , though , Parliament is to deliver an opinion on a position that has been adopted within the Council . #% This was not a military incident as far as the Member State involved is concerned . #% Could I ask , in the light of all these points that I have raised , for the Council to make a full statement on the situation in Zimbabwe and the action that it intends to take ? #% Madam President , I warmly welcome Commissioner Patten 's reassurance that poverty reduction will be a key issue on the G8 agenda . #% If not , maybe this is something that I , along with others , can do something about . #% Already Italy , France , Belgium , Luxembourg , Spain , Germany , Austria and Finland have notably and honourably ratified the Treaty . #% I am delighted that Cypriots are being supported in this House . #% Madam President , the President-in-Office has said that if you were to ask the people in Member States what they want you would get a clear message . #% Early clinical trials will begin in January 2000 in the United Kingdom , and afterwards in Nairobi . #% It is important to realise the significance of these headline goals because for once , instead of spending years discussing institutions , the European Union has put results before means . #% China , a traditional ally of Sudan because it has oil investments there , and the United States , which opposes the ICC , have both acquiesced and abstained in the Security Council . #% I ask the Commissioner to consider how far existing arrangements enable him to be confident that such standards are upheld in all cases . #% It shows the EU can deliver added value that gives practical effect to our citizens , to make our internal market work for the best . #% There is justification for an EU proposal to make that a crime everywhere . #% But the euro is not here , it is on trial and it is not necessarily a solution to Europe 's economic problems . #% If one is worried about things not being properly run it seems a pity if you advertise the fact that they are not going to be checked . #% I fully support measures to improve accessibility for people with disabilities in all areas of life ranging from employment to IT . #% We have to ask ourselves questions such as why it is that some of these murders have taken place close to security positions ; why it is that the military have not been able to protect their population . #% It is a recognition that we are moving towards a modern civil service for Europe and a proper career structure for those who work in it . #% We should be dealing with this at a nation state level and cooperating together , rather than thinking that the European Union can solve any of this . #% Secondly , I would say that we are financing statistical services from too many angles . #% In relation to health , it is a major task and we need to make a contribution . #% I am sure we also all agree that education 's prime responsibility lies with , and within , the Member States . #% Part of that action is to prevent more people becoming disabled . #% 
I accept that certain of the proposed amendments touch on some important issues and Parliament recognised them in its vote on the report on frontier workers last month - again , as recalled in the joint resolution . #% Instead , the discussion is degenerating into a shabby debate between government leaders who appear only to be interested in sharing out jobs amongst themselves , be it from small or large countries , north , south , east , west , Left or Right , and not whether someone is actually the best candidate to take the responsibilities . #% Support system for producers of certain arable crops #% In fact , the central clause that unlocked the agreement -- the freedom to provide services -- came as a result of the committee vote in this Parliament , which was contested by the Socialists . #% Mr President , on behalf of the European Parliament could you please send a letter calling for the protection of these workers to the company , to its European owners Anglo American , BHP Billiton and Glencore International , as well as to the Colombian authorities . #% But to look at some of the protestations of the cosmetics industry you would think that this directive is something new . #% Secondly , independent studies are now showing that thousands of jobs will be lost throughout the Community . #% I believe I have the balance right , particularly in the light of the fact that these provisions will apply to the applicant countries , where the technological base from which they start will be much lower than that envisaged at the moment . #% The Committee has always kept a clear priority and has insisted upon it both to the Council and to the Commission : namely to have the sharpest , best-defined route of traceability on safety grounds that we can get for mince as well as other forms of beef . #% This is a sensitive question , but I think that it would be a further step forward in improving the popular legitimacy of Parliament and the quality of our law-making . #% The Cyprus issue must be resolved . #% I do not think it is the case in the Council that the public is actually able to see and hear everything that their representatives say and do when passing laws . #% When will you respond , Mr President , and will you protect the rights and privileges of this Parliament and its petitioners ? #% The cull was an essential weapon in bringing the disease under control . #% We acknowledge the common threat of nuclear proliferation , particularly from Iran . #% The Eritreans , meanwhile , back the Islamist militias . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , firstly I would like to thank all the people who shared their knowledge and expertise with me when I was preparing this report . #% If we are going to benefit from the biotechnology industry , we need to nurture the industry . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur . #% The British Conservative Delegation do not see any cause to introduce pan-European judicial training . #% I could highlight flaws in the system of my own country - for example we have the highest number in prison of any EU State - as well as flaws in other Member States . #% Mrs Thomsen is right in her report and this evening to concentrate and focus on those problems . #% The Dary report , on the other hand , is premised on the somewhat unrealistic notion that we can ignore rulings from the WTO altogether . #% That is not sufficient justification for launching a pre-emptive attack on Iraq . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Bolkestein for his reply . #% I want to use this occasion to say something about the importance of what we are doing here . #% In order to address this ongoing problem , the Council entered into an Interinstitutional Agreement in 2006 which obliged them to produce certification for those transactions for which they are responsible . #% If this is to become the case , when food safety issues arise , consumers will have less bureaucracy to deal with and a better idea of who is culpable . #% Fortunately Russia does not want to join the European Union , but Ukraine does . #% Is the Commission making selective reductions as you suggested or will they be making any across-the-board cuts in Category 4 ? #% When people ask what is happening to public health care research , they are told that it has gone into the all-embracing Category 8 , which is rather a jumble sale of a programme with a very small amount of money attached . #% Smaller firms , on the other hand , particularly small retail firms , can not afford such specialists . #% This happened for one simple reason : Mr Blair and the Labour government have no conception of what constitutes the British national interest . #% We must be clear : Saddam Hussein must be stopped . #% Our view on the core issues is clear . #% What we must recognise , however , is that much of what creates a threat to our environment may not only be helping mankind in other ways but may actually be helping the environment itself . #% That said , I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far . #% That would be , at least , a major improvement in terms of what we are trying to achieve . #% The law provides for freedom of assembly , as long as a permit is obtained from the Minister of Interior . #% He is no doubt right . #% I welcome the statement and I am grateful to you for giving so much attention to the position of those who are excluded from society , particularly when they are minors . #% Britain has its own data -- protection register and very detailed regulations to go with it . #% Mr President , this is a very serious matter ... #% At the same time the Commission must monitor the human rights situation in Kazakhstan closely and report back to this House on progress , or the lack of it . #% The UK Independence Party is not opposed to some immigration , but this should be strictly controlled and for the benefit of Britain and not the European Union or anybody else . #% We do not know at this stage how many companies will be interested in starting up such companies , nor what flaws they might find in the legislation if they do . #% The UK Presidency was quite a good one for the European Parliament in other respects too . #% The Commission 's benchmarking of its achievements in these areas has given the European Parliament and the Council the tool to measure Europe 's progress . #% Madam President , now that we have made all these changes , I am sure your services will tell you that the text has become rather incoherent in terms of the text and its intention . #% If passed , this directive will cost without yielding benefit and will slow down growth and confidence . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I would like to invoke Rule 35 with reference to this vote . #% I want to pick up on Mr MacCormick 's points , because methinks he protests too much . #% I have not seen anything that is stone-age and I would invite Mrs Oomen-Ruijten to visit , perhaps , the Drax power station in Yorkshire . #% That does not respect our own Rules of Procedure , which allow only 32 members or a group to table amendments in plenary . #% It can be said with some confidence that tyrants rarely listen to reason and only respond when their vital interests - often personal - are seriously under threat . #% But let us think just of a few people in order to bring home the horror and suffering . #% Is it not therefore bewildering to the oppressed people of Zimbabwe that two European governments now seek to delay the renewal and dilute the force of the travel ban and other restrictive measures that the European Union has put in place against the Mugabe regime and which are due to expire on 18 February 2003 ? #% Can Mr Byrne help us ? #% He is on his way there as I speak . #% In principle , I have no objection to increasing the trade in ivory selectively , provided that the money raised is for conservation purposes . #% Mr President , yesterday I raised a point of order , which is on page 16 of the English version of the Minutes . #% But there is another factor in play and that is product information . #% Madam President , in my nine years in this Parliament I have never before heard a speech of such distorted , selfindulgent drivel as that which Mr Kerr gave a short while ago . #% Even in those days it was not easy for young farmers to carry on the family farm or get started in the industry . #% The number has grown enormously . #% Indeed , events of this week and the last month must make the applicant states wonder just what sort of organisation they have applied to join . #% 
Madam President , like many other Members I am very concerned about this lack of planning a such a late stage , when we have known for some time that tariffs were changing in 2005 . #% To echo Mr Caspary , there are a whole series of human rights and other problems . #% I wanted to draw your attention to the kidnapping of a Member of Parliament and minister , Taiseer Najeh Awad al-Mashhandani on Saturday . #% Do not create a mechanism that is unnecessary and which in the future could push Europe into a deep recession . #% Does the Commission have the political will , when this has gone through the courts , actually to address this and ensure that this very large group of employees does not continue to suffer a very severe deterioration in their conditions of service ? #% The ultimate goal will become -- or is already -- the linking-up of the whole series of EU and national databases on personal habits , biometric information and probably , eventually , DNA . #% If proof were needed , we only have to look at the European Arrest Warrant . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , may I firstly take this opportunity to give credit to Commissioner Kallas for the real progress which has been made in addressing the issues and reservations expressed by the Court of Auditors . #% Given the distress caused by alcohol in many families ' lives across the EU , as well as related ill-health issues , I find this result unsatisfactory . #% Mr President , I hope I have the Commissioner 's attention , as he is in conversation with Mr Brok at the moment . #% Our Amendment No 105 seeks to place a limit on these , but one that is still consonant with reasonable farming practices . #% Secondly , we want legal opinions drafted within the framework of a legislative process to be public , not just to parliamentary committees but also to the public , whom we represent . #% Therefore I ask you to support Amendments 107 , 108 and 109 . #% Furthermore , ministers knew this ; they were prepared to , and did , lie to the British public about this , despite the certain knowledge that the policy would be a disaster for the fishing industry , but fishermen were regarded as being politically expendable . #% But I was making a serious point and maybe yesterday it was taken rather too lightheartedly . #% Madam President , I would like the President to make urgent representations to the government in Rangoon in the light of Parliament 's strongly worded resolution . #% In conclusion , I wish to congratulate both Mr Megahy and Mrs Banotti , and to say that I am pleased that the Committee on Petitions has been able to be a useful vehicle for Parliament to express the views of many people - disabled and non-disabled - who have signed petitions on this issue and have resulted in the report of Mrs Banotti . #% It is a triumph of hope over experience to suppose that Member States will provide adequate funding for Natura 2000 , unless the incentives of specific co-financing for it are on offer via the EU budget . #% Mr President , the state of Kuwait offers many opportunities for able women today . #% There are signs that this successor IGC may achieve a degree of constitutional settlement which is much to be welcomed and to reach it , it is necessary to pass through the Treaty of Nice despite its self-evident shortcomings . #% I am gratified to see that the report acknowledges that the CAP has ` encouraged the development of non-sustainable production methods heavily dependent on water and energy ' . #% Mr President , you reminded us that today is United Nations Day and that upholding human rights is a top priority . #% It is , of course , possible to go too far and give technical data that confuses rather than informs . #% There can be little doubt of the importance of information and communication technology - the information society - to our economy and to our lifestyle . #% Nobody is allowed to know them - neither the Members of Parliament nor the petitioners - nobody . #% The promotion of the third system could contribute to an increased demand for and supply of these services and one , moreover , which could help close the employment gap most among the very social groups where it is greatest . #% Is it really up to us to regulate what other countries in the world get up to ? #% We all know that the granting of licences and the conditions attached by some Member States to the granting of licences have been unduly restrictive and protectionist and there are cases before the European Court in this respect . #% Finally , the recommendation that both sides of industry should agree on changes in working practices could pave the way for enhanced industrial relations and create a situation whereby the specialist knowledge of each party is fully utilised . #% Gas and electricity are basic necessities , not luxury goods , and this directive will be a triumph for most European consumers and some producers of energy . #% Looking at the situation in the UK , the British Government quite simply got it wrong . #% But it is disruptive and dangerous and the UK needs to recognise that this is its problem too . #% I wonder whether the Commissioner would be prepared to consider that ? #% The key points for the European Parliament during the negotiations have been the role of the European Parliament itself in relation to the Asylum Support Office , how to achieve greater solidarity between the Member States , and the role of civil society and UNHCR with the Office . #% There are warning signs if we do become complacent . #% The question of drink and driving is a problem we have right across the Union and very strong measures are taken in many Member States to deal with the question . #% Although there was an initial Austrian initiative , which this report supports , it did not contain a definition . #% Here again , young farmers must be placed in a position which will allow them to embrace a new upcoming culture and to be aware of the benefits attached to maintaining consumer confidence and support for agricultural products . #% It is very painful for the farming industry to see this happen and it is happening now throughout the whole of Europe , so action needs to be taken . #% These are issues which need to be addressed and they are not being addressed thoroughly enough . #% They also need to raise the issue of the effect of the liberalization on the ability of developing countries to adopt the poverty focused programmes which are essential to their progress . #% It establishes an important point , namely that tourism is an industry of the single European market despite the failure of the Council of Ministers to recognize that . #% I believe that the European Union should try and reflect this shift in policy ; not that democracy is better than stability , but that democracy and human rights are better than ` business as usual ' . #% So not merely for administrative and technical reasons but also for political and institutional reasons , we in the Group of the European People 's Party will enthusiastically be supporting this report . #% There have been two EU civil missions in the Congo and it is not clear what the mandate of any EU military mission would now be . #% We all , of course , urged them to return to the negotiating table -- I say all of us , but if we ban them they will not be able to do that -- because a political solution is the only hope . #% That is never the case . #% Socialist amendments underscoring some of these sins of omission and commission have been incorporated in Parliament 's report . #% Red tape and regulation are luxuries Europe can no longer afford . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , you are very kind . #% The market is quite capable of regulating itself . #% As others have said , it is important , too , that we recognise the contribution of older people who are already keeping society and our economy going , by acting as carers offering childcare , for example , so that their children can go out to work , or by acting as volunteers . #% Whenever before did a sovereign nation permit outsiders to write and impose a new constitution on them , except after defeat in war ? #% If and when he does - and I am answering the question - I will give him the basis for a scientific view of what the consequences of the use of depleted uranium are in those circumstances . #% However , with greater power there should be greater accountability and transparency . #% Not a single word of explanation . #% I would like him to bear that in mind . #% We should do nothing in the course of this legislation that makes it harder for people to offer this most precious of donations . #% As now proposed , the procedures go much further than is either necessary to deal with the terrorist threat , or desirable in terms of both safeguarding human rights or respecting due legal process , as is currently satisfied by the extradition agreement processes . #% Mr President , I am concerned that the leader of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party in this House sought to misrepresent the position of the British Government during that debate . #% Natura 2000 has had a negative effect in this regard . #% We look forward to more progress , particularly on some of the tax issues . #% The last point refers to the question of the implications for enlargement . #% The suggestion of two new recitals aims to ensure coherence with the Water Framework Directive requirements on priority substances . #% If you look at the Danish economic study on the opening-up of the internal market for services , it identifies professional qualifications as the area with the most potential for growth . #% However , Commissioner , you said one or two things in your speech which concern me . #% 
By making massive reforms that radically change systems and structures , we foster the kind of culture of transparency and accountability which is fundamental to the successful operation of activity-based management and of the activity-based budgeting which reinforces that process . #% There is now also some evidence from e-mails that the controller of the shoe-bomber Richard Reid , from my country alas , may have been based in Pakistan . #% Mr President , I agree with Mrs Flautre 's condemnation of the scandalous fact that Guantanamo Bay has now been in existence for four years . #% In trying to achieve our ideals by means of coercion , we kill off the source of our wealth . #% Certainly they are not getting even the medical support that they need , let alone the emotional support - or indeed , in some cases , alternative employment , if it is considered that , when they have contracted something like HIV , there may be a risk to patients . #% These terrorist bombs were clearly designed to cause maximum civilian causalities , to destabilise Indian society and weaken the Indian economy . #% It is a necessarily complex measure because it is a quid pro quo for making binding the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% I trust that the European Council will follow the spirit of the Constitution , which requires a third of Member States to trigger such a mechanism and not simply a single truculent member . #% To go that one stage further would add a new dimension to the European elections , make them more understandable to the public and have a visible effect , at least on the chief executive . #% The right to tax citizens is one of the hallmarks of a government . #% One major policy change that the new government of Ukraine could make and which would demonstrate Kiev 's independence from Russia is to help solve the Transnistria problem . #% We should remember their sacrifice . #% Thus , with the support of a number of colleagues , I have tabled some amendments that not only address my concerns but all of those across the industry . #% The situation in the province is obviously a matter of concern for the Commission , and in a recent statement the European Union presidency and the Commission , as co-chairs of the Tokyo Conference on peace and reconstruction in Aceh , voiced their concern about the extension of the state of military emergency in the province . #% Firstly , there are those who say they oppose the Constitution because it does not go far enough . #% Best of all , the directive will increase chocolate sales overall , thereby increasing the market for developing countries ' exports . #% It is therefore imperative that both we and the Council find an amicable solution to getting an interinstitutional agreement . #% In recent days we have heard that EU membership costs this country EUR 20 per head , or that country EUR 50 per head . #% The committee felt that the circumstances in which he had used the words complained of by the French prosecutor were not circumstances where it could be said fairly and squarely that he was only exercising his mandate as a Member of this House or carrying out his duties as a Member of this House . #% There can be no hanging back in the millennium : free these poor women now ! #% But it is normal practice . #% I call upon the House to support my amendments to produce a more balanced resolution . #% I do not question that . #% He has been negotiating with North Korea to acquire ballistic missile technology . #% The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination . #% I am pleased that MEPs are reiterating our insistence on the aim of a free transatlantic market by 2015 . #% We should join calls on Shell to publicly denounce this . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Stenzel for her very effective and useful report . #% It is equally important to say that those kind of stable funding regimes assist our work enormously . #% The EU wants to increase the public subsidy to organic farming rather than allowing this sector to be consumer-led . #% That is where leaders need to give ministers a big kick but instead all they will really do is ratchet up the rhetoric of repression and hostility of fortress Europe . #% The message from both those meetings was one of extreme concern , concern that unless we in the European Union are sympathetic to the already fragile state of the South African economy , an unfavourable trading framework would inflict enormous damage upon them . #% Well , Mr Mandelson has made it clear already that we are not going to play the game . #% Helping save America and Europe from the disastrous policies of the Bush administration is a pro-American exercise . #% We need to look at the cell-based vaccines of one month and even the possibility of DNA vaccines , which could be as low as one month , but still need a lot of development . #% All this is the more regrettable given the first signs of success associated with the single market . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , 2007 will be the key year for us all to find our own way to escape from the constitutional crisis and I am very pleased to hear from President Barroso that he plans for the Commission to play a central part in that exercise . #% It is a sensible , straightforward single market proposal with a number of important features and I hope it will have your unanimous support . #% I saw equipment that was 20 years out of date -- radiotherapy equipment that was Soviet built and was broken down , with spares unavailable . #% At the present time aircraft carrying plutonium are flying over Member States including the UK . #% So we should be very clear that there is nothing in this report that makes life difficult for European operators . #% In addition , there is a cruel criminal code which provides for flogging , amputation and death for adultery and acts against the Republic and Islam . #% Mr President , I am advised that the figures that we have just voted on do not make sense unless we vote on the Wynn report which is about the financial perspective . #% This brings the European Union into disrepute . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I rise before the House today to mention one or two things which might perhaps be of help . #% As has been said , we must ensure that all the measures in those agreements are being carried out if fish stocks are to remain at a sustainable level . #% The Council has tried to appease Parliament , perhaps not sufficiently yet , but they have also apologised for their mistakes during this process . #% The EU , through its ill thought-out policy , is destroying livelihoods in developing nations across the world . #% I hope the Commissioner will reconsider this and find some space in his obviously very hectic diary . #% I visited a children 's home in an area that had been badly affected by floods and a factory that had benefited from EU funding . #% This is the regulation to which that refers , and this is the implementation of it . #% Well , we believe that very soon there is to be a general election in the United Kingdom , and I think the voters are going to want to know what has happened to that GBP 75 billion deficit in our contributions . #% If it were to be proposed that British workers should be helped from this fund , I would obviously support it . #% Logically , yes , but does this way forward respect subsidiarity ? #% The immediate response I got this week was : `` No '' . #% Mr President , in my hurry to join the vote I pressed Mrs Reding 's button instead of my own . #% These are simply common-sense measures that will help prevent people being smuggled into countries across Europe . #% The three principles enunciated in that report on international fisheries agreements last May seem to have been partially heeded , but not completely . #% Also , a social clause - which many people have mentioned - should be jointly managed by the ILO to ensure that some of the susceptibilities we all know about are dealt with . #% This is a good step in the right direction because it is important that the money also goes into furthering our development goals . #% That the EU can continue to allow animals to be transported across Europe for many hours -- sometimes over 40 or 50 hours , sometimes up to 90 hours -- is completely unacceptable , both from an animal welfare point of view and from the point of view of trying to prevent the spread of disease . #% We have an EU of 25 Member States , covering 1.5 million square miles of territory . #% Perhaps for the first time in our discharge procedure we have tackled those issues which are of great concern to the public about the European Parliament 's budget , in particular the excessive costs of having more than one seat and the potential costs of extending buildings in Strasbourg to accommodate more Members . #% However , let us also be vigilant in ensuring that the European Union does not , in its haste , take steps which exceed the current needs . #% The PPE-DE Group supports the broad aims of the regulation . #% The World Bank has now recognised this and I understand is abandoning its so-called Western Poverty Project proposal . #% 
In my remaining seconds I would just say that I am very grateful indeed to the rapporteur , Mrs Gebhardt , on the issue of enforcement for accepting that each state should be allowed to decide how the regulation should be implemented by the public authorities , but according to Amendment No 76 it will be implemented by public authorities in alliance with , but not supplanted by , other public interests and by NGOs . #% As Tanzania 's Trade Minister , Mr Iddi Simba , said , the wrong policy on agriculture might lose elections in France , but it loses lives in Africa . #% Whilst I acknowledge that you played a key role in negotiating the pact 's original rules , you recently said that the credibility of the pact had been buried and that the pact was dead . #% In essence , Chirac , by protecting the little French farmer , is holding the world to ransom . #% I consider Annex XV to be a direct infringement of Parliament 's rights . #% In short , this is a confused and confusing report and its aim , in my view , along with the Commission communication , is to use fiscal initiatives to impose harmonisation on the grounds of environmental objectives , despite this not being an area of competence for the EU . #% Mr President , I just wish to thank all those Members of the House , across all nationalities , delegations and groups , who signed my written declaration . #% A tool to get a grip on an outturn is so much better than just a grip on promises . #% That is a matter we should certainly investigate . #% However , since the Europe of Nations Group has broken the consensus by putting down a number of amendments , the PSE feels justified in voting against paragraph 5 so that the joint resolution concentrates on the real issue concerning this House - the need to reduce the use of antibiotics in animals in the human food chain to the absolute minimum required to treat specific cases of disease in individual animals and herds whilst further research and exchange of information are carried out . #% I have a question for the Council . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I support the protection of victims . #% How can 25 countries have one single trade policy ? #% I would cite in particular its highly selective use of material and its failure to reflect the full findings of the UK Court of Appeal in the Jaffrey case , including its view that it was only with the benefit of hindsight that reserves established by syndicates for asbestos liabilities in the 1980s proved to be inadequate , given the unanticipated way in which those liabilities developed . #% I want to emphasise what I believe is the real challenge which will face you and your colleagues when you sit down at the end of this month to discuss the presidency 's proposal : namely how to change our whole attitude and thinking about entrepreneurship , about encouraging people to go out and start the new businesses that we now acknowledge are the engines of the new economy . #% The issue of noise is a very important consideration in that respect . #% They will not address the actual issues in the workplace , but it is something which governments can do relatively easily . #% Also the motion fails to recognise the importance of ensuring that access to such data should be limited to appropriate law enforcement agencies trusted with counter-terrorism action . #% I also observe in here , Mr Barroso , that you are going to ` take delivery up to cruising speed ' ! #% Progress has been made in terms of some of the amendments now tabled . #% My question to the Commissioner is : In such a market place as he proposes , how do we protect European citizens ' preferences in public health and environmental areas , as illustrated by the GMO issue ? #% So we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking . #% So far , so good . #% I am quite sure that he is well aware of that situation and will make sure that we are in a strong position for those WTO negotiations . #% Mr President , I apologise for arriving a little late , but aircraft being what they are I am lucky to be here at all . #% In conclusion , let us remember the extraordinary nature of the earthquake and the strength of the tsunami that hit the Fukushima installation and which has started all this process . #% In the absence of timely political action , humanitarian aid then steps in to pick up the pieces . #% We do not have the power to do it in the Commission . #% Should journalists be subject to new regulations that may be established by the Commission and financial regulators , as currently proposed under Article 6 ( 10 ) ? #% Instead I seek support for Amendments Nos 23 and 24 which , taken together , should have the effect of securing the second of the two objectives without detracting from the first . #% Certainly the current crisis has revealed some of the underlying problems with the present design of the eurozone . #% Volunteers are often unsung heroes . #% It is vital that European institutions get this opportunity right . #% They already are in a position over and over again to explain to us what is needed , what will work and what will help them . #% I know this House does not need convincing , but as a direct and leading contributor to relieving suffering and rebuilding normality and as a coordinator of the efforts of others , the European Union must make the maximum possible commitment . #% I have worked with the Commission 's air quality experts on the ozone matter and I can assure the House that I did not find them unambitious - quite the opposite . #% I urge many others who have doubts about it to do the same . #% Europe 's reaction will be an important test of our ability to project our own foreign policy interests , rather than acquiesce in the US neo-conservative agenda that threatens us all . #% That was the party which I felt obliged to abandon because it had become totally negative about Europe . #% Nor should the EU be in the business of signing military cooperation agreements with Russia and the CIS countries . #% But according to a recent report from the Work Foundation , based in the UK , the pattern of working in excess of 60 hours a week is prevalent now throughout the European Union , particularly in certain sectors . #% It was in Cairo that the United States Secretary of State made an important statement on 22 June at the American University , where she declared that , in the Middle East , democracy was better than stability , overturning -- as she put it -- 60 years of American policy . #% These issues can only be resolved by a greater sense of trust between partners - such trust that is the essential glue of successful federal pacts . #% We simply do not know because we have not had the risk assessments . #% Mr President , before we vote on this particular report , I think that it is important that Members are aware of the legal advice given by our own legal services , which was not available when we voted in committee . #% We used to regulate the telecom sector through national regulators , but these will wither away in future because we are moving towards a single , global regulator , namely the market . #% Whilst I welcome the measures that enable the 18 additional MEPs to take their seats , I do not believe that they should enjoy observer status until the transitional provisions come into force . #% Exposure to asbestos can maim and kill and asbestos workers have to be protected . #% We should also be looking at leather goods and footwear , and using textiles as an industrial sector flagship that can lead the way in this new century , with European workers able to earn a living from producing high-value , quality products . #% Some areas where innovation is required , such as agriculture , have been largely ignored , but we strongly support the broad thrust of the programme and the continued development of the single market in particular . #% Most UK retailers are keen to avoid trading in battery caged eggs after the deadline , but they can only succeed in this if these eggs are properly identified . #% I hope the Commissioner will take the opportunity this morning to guarantee to us that the new sets of guidelines will be ready by 31 December . #% That should please the smaller states and not frighten those larger states which are genuinely committed to making it simpler for the Council to reach a decision . #% One important reason is because the UK , unlike other states , does not involve MPs in the transposition process . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I wish to announce that we supported the resolution adopted on the IGC , and we take this as an appeal to the Irish presidency to get moving . #% Thank you Commissioner for acknowledging that you understand that there are these perceptions on the part of the ACP negotiators . #% The final clause reads : ` ... to prepare them ' -- that is to say school students -- ` for their roles as future citizens and as members of the European Union ' . #% We want you to go out there and sell the package . #% I believe strongly that we must always be extremely wary in Europe of over-regulation , of using ' a sledge-hammer to crack a nut ' , of introducing unnecessary , cumbersome and bureaucratic regulations . #% If not , then the Recital C and paragraph 1 of the Bourlanges ' report will certainly have to be taken note of . #% But I believe there is good news that we can focus on even in that tragic situation where the possibility of a citizen losing his life at the hands of the State is upheld by the Court of Appeal . #% I urge that the AU and the EU act today to bring a semblance of justice to the people of Zimbabwe . #% There must be a reinforcement of discipline in the good years and , in the short term , there must be an agreement on the size and speed of the adjustments necessary for the countries in breach to move back to balance . #% We shall certainly support the Conference of Presidents ' proposal , but in view of my earlier remarks we should now reconsider this position , or at least be given some assurances about the French authorities ' actions on this matter . #% It would happen in any other walk of life , it would happen in any business , and I suggest that it really ought to happen in European politics . #% It is by no means a step backwards . #% 
Secondly , there is a thread of political correctness running through the proposal . #% I wish the Irish presidency all the luck for which its people are so famous . #% That is certainly one of the things my party will be looking at very closely in the discharge procedure . #% It is worth mentioning that large numbers of projects in Valencia were rushed through prior to the entry into force of the new law . #% Is there not a case for returning to the status quo at least of two and a half years ago ? #% It is better to lay some stress on the positive aspects of that , rather than go into the legal quibbles of what is or is not requested or permitted or demanded under the Interinstitutional Agreement . #% However , whilst I would not claim to be an expert - as no other member of the committee would - on the issue of which of the various propellant sprays can safely be used , enough doubts were raised in committee , not least when we heard from the representative of the Commission , about the propellant sprays themselves . #% The men with clipboards and the statistical spies from Eurostat want more data and - let us be honest - you want this data to tax and control , which explains your thirst for ever more statistics . #% Mr President , we were told by Council this morning that East Timor deserves our full support . #% If you go on pushing your extreme euro-nationalism , this will lead to violence . #% The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorny Karabakh and the fighting over Abkhazia in Georgia make this a volatile region . #% I wish to speak mainly in relation to the Linzer report and I very much welcome some of the changes that have been made by way of amendment . #% We still have to get the process ratified by parliaments , including , in particular , by the European Parliament . #% I would remind him of the principle of ` unright time ' , according to which people always say that the time is not right for doing something . #% We have to face the fact that here in the West brain tumours have risen dramatically by some 100 % over the last ten years for totally unknown reasons . #% It is immoral - immoral ! - to ask ordinary taxpayers of any country to pick up the tab for failed politicians and failed banks . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , I would like to begin by welcoming this Parliament 's involvement in UN initiatives . #% At this point , I must say how well the European Parliament meetings in Cancún were received , and how well we were supported by some of the developing countries . #% Our group will seek to support an inclusion of an amendment to the motion endorsing this . #% The Commission 's action plan for saving 20 % by 2020 is not a stand-alone plan . #% I feel that this is something that should have been put on the agenda . #% LDCs have seen a severe drop in capital flows , down 45 % since 1990 ; and official development assistance continues to go down , having fallen by 30 % since 1990 . #% Rumour has it , Mr President , that the early retirement package which is being negotiated in the Council at the moment is not open to Parliament . #% Equalising the rates would be equivalent to up to 7 million jobs . #% Last year a third of senior management posts in DG IB , dealing with Asia and Latin America , remained vacant ; 40 % of staff in DG I , IA and IB are on short-term contracts , whilst a large number of core tasks are carried out by external consultants . #% President Klaus has been quite right to compare the European Union to the old Soviet Union . #% I can not therefore follow the lead of our excellent rapporteur , who recommends granting discharge to the Commission , for the reasons I have already given and because many people outside this place have been wondering what actually improved between 1996 and 1998 . #% More importantly , it is hardly the most positive signal to send to Podgorica , or indeed to countries elsewhere in the region , such as Macedonia , working hard to obtain candidate status . #% I support the efforts made by President Xanana Gusmao and the international community to bypass the prime minister , who seems to be refusing to resign and is very intransigent , and to disarm the paramilitary groups , re-establish law and order and enable aid and reconstruction to flow back into the territory . #% In this area , the social partners have been trying to reach an agreement for ten years . #% This means standing up to George Bush . #% Since we are having difficulty in getting Mr Crowley and Mr Dell ` Alba , let me make a general remark about the work of the Rules of Procedure Committee . #% However , as other Members have indicated , the final report has been subject to amendments put forward by political groups in the Parliament , which suggest breaches of law which did not take place , even deliberately misreporting the numbers of animals killed . #% He worked very closely with all the shadow rapporteurs , improved an already pretty good common position and produced a good draft report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% When he was tried three years ago , there was international outcry , and at that time I understand that the Chinese Government promised a retrial in the Supreme Court . #% Mr President , it is exactly the same point . #% It is worth noting that those earlier crop regulations have been the subject of many modifications . #% This is very familiar ground for those that have worked in the area of free movement of workers and mutual recognition of qualifications across the European Community . #% It is time for this misinformed hysteria in the UK to stop . #% In other words , the European taxpayer pays and the whole deal is underwritten by the Swedish Government . #% We , therefore , seek reassurance this afternoon that the Council of Ministers and the Commission share our view on this and that they too feel that a stronger Europe will mean a stronger Nato . #% The Balkans : NATO was on the ground sorting out the mess , and the EU held meetings . #% Much as all of us long to see a democratic regime in Iraq , delaying the consolidation of Kurdish autonomy until then leaves a vacuum in which the murderous intrigue of recent years can continue . #% This is a problem which is totally preventable and by putting some money into it we could stop the unnecessary suffering of women . #% It is excessive and wrong . #% On behalf of Mr Cox , the President of Parliament , I have received a petition signed by 22 000 Eritreans living in the European Union and in Norway . #% If what comes from the Commission is sensible , we only need to amend it to improve , simplify or clarify . #% So let me echo Mr MacCormick : there is a need for much more clearly-based factual evidence before we make changes to this legislation . #% I want to pick up one or two points , but first I must respond briefly to what Mr Miller said . #% What is the EU doing about this ? #% We are sceptical about demands for substantial increases in expenditure and bureaucratic activity and in the role of EC-funded NGOs . #% We need to have a multinational approach to the global problems . #% Madam President , this is an important debate with major consequences for the future of the Union , and I also want to pay tribute to the rapporteur for the impressive way in which he has carried out what is undoubtedly a very onerous task in producing his report . #% It is about time we all calmed down and realised that minimal global warming is naturally occurring in a cycle that has no input from man . #% It is a port which is close to London and the major transport networks from the south-east of England to the whole of the United Kingdom . #% The legislation itself will be the instrument which creates distortions in an otherwise satisfactory market . #% This report is typical of the socialistic approach so beloved of this Parliament . #% This may be a worthy project in its own right , but clearly it would be remiss of Parliament , which represents the people , to agree with this expenditure at this time . #% I would also welcome an invitation to Mr Staes ' meeting . #% Did they give us that ? #% Progress will not extend to freedom of association , freedom of speech and democracy . #% On the whole , we believe that the Commission did a reasonable job . #% The first report on this multi-annual programme was in January 2001 . #% Because of that , by far the majority view in my group and in others as well , is that a vote of censure would be inappropriate . #% Something called Europe can provide - to use Hong Kong parlance - the ` through train ' to continue interest . #% When it came forward two years ago there was no cost impact assessment attached . #% 
However it was very important to consider our responsibility carefully as it would have had a direct effect on those countries legally bound by this Directive . #% Confused ? #% I have been the rapporteur on several previous occasions and have had the pleasure of seeing the IDABC programme grow . #% His suggestion of a tri-partite committee is well-meaning , but inadequate . #% You did not withdraw the proposal , you amended it , and that amended proposal is still on the table and I hope the Council will take it up . #% That is the terrible story of my constituent , Mirza Tahir Hussain , condemned to death early next month . #% I have just one small supplementary in relation to the training of officials , which the Commissioner referred to . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - Mr President , it gives me the greatest of pleasure to welcome every word that the Commissioner spoke this evening and also to congratulate Mrs Thomsen , who has done a wonderful job as rapporteur on this most important subject . #% I am sure that people across the EU are hoping and praying for his release . #% I welcome the directive . #% We want to see a renewed commitment to the completion of the single market . #% In his usual modest way he has also said that amendments from other groups and colleagues have made it better still , and he has indeed accepted amendments from a large number of colleagues from different political groupings and other committees . #% Therefore I hope that we in Parliament , and the Council and the Commission , will provide the maximum possible support for election-observer missions at all levels . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - President of Europe - this long-awaited day . #% There is Kyrgyzstan 's hydro-electric power which is undermining the downstream countries . #% In both countries women face harassment , violent attacks , death threats and murder because they are women . #% We should not prejudice the debate at this stage . #% They border Ukraine , a country of enormous geopolitical significance , whose very existence is a major factor in the security and stability of Europe , but where recent developments are cause for concern . #% We have heard from the Commissioner why it will take time to do that , but I seem to remember joining with other Members of Parliament in calling for this some three years ago . #% I just want to make a few very brief points because much has already been said by the rapporteur . #% We know that in that part of the world there is little to choose between two despotic regimes , one in Iran and one in Iraq . #% They tell me they have supplied co-generation plant over the past 20 years , which has contributed to an estimated annual saving of 700 000 tonnes of carbon , which is a significant saving . #% This may seem to some to be a minor issue , but for me it is a point of principle that has to be made . #% First , the Commission has already stated that it has no objections to the inclusion in the conclusions which will be adopted at Seattle of wording on the role of the European Parliament in the conduct and completion of the new WTO round . #% Mr Markov talked about ` one size fits all ' . #% Finally , as regards the Fava report and the sustainability of the fisheries industry , decommissioning may be good for marine resources , but if fleets are reduced too far then the industry simply can not survive . #% The two should not be confused . #% We must do all we can to release from detention this brave and honourable woman . #% We are all behind you on that , Mr Barroso . #% Of course , the numbers vary from country to country . #% We saw this during the enlargement debate where the American approach to the speed and nature of EU enlargement , particularly to the role of Turkey in this , was , quite frankly , extremely simplistic . #% First of all , we have had some debate to finalise some of the issues around the type-approval for buses and the timescale for that . #% We can only continue with it on the basis of a sound calculation about funding and a clear indication of where the responsibilities lie . #% We have got to do better in the new year . #% We know the list is incomplete and that Member States have not found it possible to identify , when shipments are presented for clearance , what products they contain . #% The debate about non-conventional medicines , which is undoubtedly controversial , crystallizes that wider debate . #% We would hope that the Fisheries Council will see fit to take its views on board when it reaches its formal decision . #% Do we really want to include consumable spare parts and sub-assemblies in this proposal even if they add contamination and enormous technical problems to the recycling process ? #% It gives them choices and it reflects their enhanced status in a new Internet world , which gives them more power and more choices than ever before . #% We only had a small meeting with the interparliamentary union . #% For the moment it is an open question . #% He briefly mentioned that . #% That is why I welcome the Hyland report - although it is not without flaws - as amended in committee . #% To get back to the basic challenges . #% Since , however , the Community is funding the exercise , it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment . #% The requirement for regular bills , based on actual consumption , will put an end to that problem . #% When it comes to the EUR 500 million , there is confusion in my mind . #% In the future , if the EU concentrates more of its efforts on economic policy instead of other distractions , I see the potential for a massive free-trading alliance . #% I have to say that for those affected , removing the restrictions by June sounds a very long way off . #% She wrote to the airline but was given no compensation ; the national body also said that the airline had acted properly . #% I recognise the role of insurgency but we must acknowledge that the Indian side has one of the highest ratios of military and security personnel to the population of any part of the world . #% That is a useful outcome of this exercise . #% As any student of politics knows , linking something to a tax is the sure-fire way of condemning it to the dustbin of history . #% Enlargement is , I hope , a vehicle for reform and change in the European Union . #% The question did not intend to imply that items such as structural funding were not of interest to some Member States . #% Every loss of innocent life is a tragedy , but Saddam Hussein has executed and tortured more people in the last two weeks for desertion and for welcoming our troops than the alliance may have killed accidentally as a result of the military hostilities . #% No wonder the smugglers and traffickers are laughing all the way to the bank . #% There is a disturbing parallel emerging between the political of the EU on the one hand and the former USSR on the other . #% A Canadian researcher was saying that as a result of air recycling in the cabin some passengers are at risk of catching diseases as serious as tuberculosis . #% We have had Mrs Ahern - I am sorry she is not here - saying it will be a disastrous outcome if the committee ' s report is voted through . #% Would the Commissioner agree that it is vitally important for Members of this House to understand the huge variety of discriminatory and anti-competitive practices that Member States currently apply against service providers ? #% Do not go into bed with the USA , because the USA 's farm bill certainly went against the principles that we in the European Union want . #% Firstly , please tell us today that no such campaign will be undertaken in Great Britain , Denmark or Sweden . #% I very much regret as well that we have not had the opportunity for a prior debate really in Europe about whether it is appropriate to try to extend international trade rules to cover government procurement at all . #% The issue here is not the rights or wrongs of this latest allegation but the fact that this type of uncertainty will continue unless we have a new proactive strategy based on more and better research , appropriate action by the airlines and better information to the public . #% That is stirring up homophobic prejudice and I deplore it . #% 
He referred to the likelihood of bringing this into operation in December . #% If we are really interested in upholding the rights of our citizens , I urge the Commission to bring forward proposals and accept the principle of free movement . #% Many of the run-down areas in the European Union with high levels of unemployment are often associated with these ports and coastal areas . #% We were told that because of the Rules of this House we could not meet on a Wednesday morning with the President of the Commission , we could only meet on Wednesday afternoon . #% That is a matter for each Member State in accordance with its Constitution and its traditions . #% All of this imposes a special responsibility on us , a special trust , and we must ask ourselves whether we could look our constituents in the eye and say yes : all of this money has been spent and properly accounted for . #% I come back to the question of using military applications for peacekeeping operations . #% I would ask that we support the 20/20 compact idea ; the idea that recipient countries should be providing and increasing their basic social expenditure . #% We need success on completing the Doha Round for trade and development . #% I must say I disagree with the PPE-DE Group on this and I would point out that the position that I am defending is based on what was adopted by Parliament in Mr Bourlanges ' own report . #% Mr President , one of President Barroso 's themes this morning was the need for us to inspire the people of Europe , too many of whom have become disillusioned with the whole concept of our European Union . #% I suggest that we shy away from the European Protection Order . #% We would look forward to the early implementation , finally , in the United Kingdom . #% I understand Commissioner Kinnock 's hesitation and his hesitations because this matter is sub judice . #% Whilst to focus on procedural details is essential , no amount of organisational improvements will compensate for the biggest loss at Seattle , a loss of political conviction in the merits of open , multilateral rules-based trade liberalisation . #% I am grateful for constructive contributions and I can reply very briefly but I hope reassuringly to the honourable Members who have contributed . #% Some countries believe that health , education and water should only be provided by the state . #% I hope that the Commission will give this major priority in the coming period , notwithstanding the discussions that may take place in relation to future enlargement of the European Union . #% Some in the chemical industry argue that such testing is costly . #% It has been a complex process of consultation with colleagues and with the Council that has led to a complex set of mainly technical and linguistic amendments . #% This must be the overriding priority defining the Commission . #% When the committee of inquiry was established , I thought it would be an important opportunity to learn important lessons from the near-collapse of Equitable Life and provide some explanations to those who were the victims . #% Mr President , this programme offers real hope for the revitalisation and refocusing of the Lisbon Agenda . #% I am afraid this is not the `` fullest possible details '' , since half of it is a letter to Mr Prodi . #% But we have to work within the boundaries of what is scientifically provable and in practical terms possible to implement . #% In the meantime , I certainly welcome the rapporteur 's report with the hope that the Commission will give that report their full support . #% It is fine if you are a big company , but if you are a microbusiness with a handful of employees , you do not have the capacity to access complex programmes . #% In order to get agreement from the UN Security Council for the first Gulf war , the US used bribery , blackmail and threats and they will do it again . #% Yet regions in our Union such as my own , let alone regions of developing countries , could be adversely affected or simply miss out on the benefits of the information age because these benefits are so unevenly distributed . #% Well , I hope this week 's news that Volkswagen is to build plants in both India and Russia will show that there are global considerations and that the fund will be used to intervene . #% That is why my group firmly believes that there is a role for foundation legislation , not total legislation - do not let us fall into the trap of believing this is the only way forward - but foundation legislation to provide a baseline for public reporting . #% Mr President , many in my group have highlighted the enormous weaknesses in the Sacconi-Nassauer compromise in terms of health and the environment and of course I agree with them . #% The main thing I want to comment on is the Commission 's decision today to take the Ecofin Council to court over its suspension of the Stability Pact . #% Furthermore , strong targets for 2020-2050 for reduction of CO2 emissions as pronounced in this report are the only reasonable way ahead . #% It can then be taken at Council on Friday of this week under the Danish Presidency . #% Many people feel frustrated by the absence of clear decisions and also by the lack of contact between authorisation bodies in different Member States . #% Paragraph 14 of the resolution -- on which we have asked for a split vote -- invites the Dalai Lama to address Parliament in what would be seen as his capacity as a head of state . #% Well he has not got the guts to turn up today . #% This is an excellent idea and I hope that we can find some rich donor who might be able to take it forward in what are likely to be the two municipalities of the town . #% I was in Burma this weekend . #% But judging from our experience with the end-of-life vehicles directive , that will not be the case so far as many Member States are concerned . #% Without this right , asylum seekers could be shuffled between Member States whilst the outcome of their appeal is pending . #% If we manage to find a solution to this issue now we will have eliminated a problem that has messed up and held up numerous legislative procedures , and we will have removed one of the obstacles to Parliament being willing to delegate far more implementing powers to the Commission than is the case under these procedures . #% It should not be about local versus foreign providers . #% Third , and most important in my view , it will provide more democracy and accountability in the Union . #% I attended the Tokyo Pledging Conference and was proud to see the way in which European Union leadership in nation rebuilding was exemplified by both the Commission and the presidency . #% What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter , to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax . #% Yet the failure to sign the Kyoto Agreement threatens billions around the world , and the very existence of nations like Bangladesh and the Maldives . #% What does this mean in concrete terms in relation to this agreement ? #% You want call-back , Mr Goebbels , I want call-back and so does Mr Bolkestein . #% In the light of current events in the UK , this report centres on an extremely important issue . #% However , there should be some checks and balances on the Executive Board , which is why we propose that the Governing Council should be able to overturn decisions of the Executive Board by a two-thirds majority . #% In voting for amendments 18 and 56 , we reaffirm the right to self-determination for the Kashmiri people , which can be expressed through a plebiscite when the conditions are right . #% Currently , Member States must ensure there is appropriate regulation so that persons who disseminate research or other information , i.e. news organisations , take reasonable care that such information is fairly presented . #% It is also incredibly naive of Martin Schulz to criticise the President of the Commission for playing a part in domestic politics : we are not served by the -- political people divorced from their political roots . #% There are some indications on the legal bases , in these lengthy , somewhat impenetrable annexes , but no reference whatsoever to the choice of legislative instrument . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , as rapporteur I can accept the oral amendment . #% They do not believe in a currency which is not backed by a political institution or a government . #% So there is a link between the cost of smoking and the amount that is actually smoked . #% In the McCartney case we have both , set against a political backdrop that has further constricted the truth . #% If they looked at history , they would see how fruitless such efforts have been throughout the centuries . #% It is rather ironic that in many senses industry seems to be far more ambitious in this area than even the Commission itself . #% Mr Harbour says we have not done it yet but I would say to him that this is the first stage . #% My colleague Mrs Miguélez Ramos will no doubt highlight the effects that this disaster has had and continues to have on the Galician coast . #% Since last weekend , as the Commissioner and other speakers have mentioned , over a dozen people have died as a result of terrorist violence . #% Second , there is a need to recognise that labour market reforms have to be geared towards the creation of better-quality jobs , with a clear emphasis on the requirement for substantial investment in people and their potentials . #% 
I think it shows the partnership that is being developed and a maturity towards the budget from the three institutions involved . #% Those conditions have been met . #% In other words , this is naked propaganda . #% My last point concerns Romania and Bulgaria , particularly Romania , a country I know well . #% Mr President , I should also like to thank the rapporteurs for their work and remind colleagues that the real issues , the three guiding principles against which we should test these proposals , must be safety , environmental sustainability and consumer rights . #% As Members will be aware , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety subsequently adopted an amendment , which I tabled , introducing an exemption for this long-established traditional European art . #% In yesterday 's Financial Times , Arthur Levitt , a former Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission wrote `` Investors , public companies , accounting firms , stock markets and regulators around the world today face one of the great challenges for the global financial system 's future : how to fashion an enduring system of comparable , uniform and high-quality financial reporting that is accepted just as much in Europe as it is in the US , and in developed countries as in emerging ones . #% Madam President , I would like to give an explanation of vote both on my own behalf and that of the British Labour Members here . #% Tens of thousands of people have written from 110 countries to appeal for clemency in the Amina case . #% Is it true that , as Mrs Andreasen stated in a press release today , if the accounting systems had been put in place before , we might not have had this kind of problem ? #% Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Maat for his report . #% I watched the screen , but I was not quick enough . #% In terms of culture , the EU can assist Member States in getting the best out of their policy priorities through exchanges of best practice and highlighting areas of importance , such as early years learning , the reduction of early school leaving and the promotion of vocational training . #% Of course there are parliamentary channels to use to do that , and I use them , but I also believe it is legitimate and essential to use extra-parliamentary channels as well . #% Mr President , first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Bouwman , for his efforts over quite a long period of time in negotiating this very satisfactory proposal which will - as all colleagues have said so far - significantly reduce the amount of pollution dumped illegally into the seas around Europe . #% It is very important that we recognise regional differences . #% Nowhere to be seen for these two countries , both of which have a long and frankly despicable record . #% Finally , can I say we also need to work very closely with other institutions , particularly the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee , which I know were very concerned about their budget for 2012 as well . #% Registration -- maybe ; evaluation by scientists -- of course ; but authorisation by officials in a chemicals agency ? #% In the interests of creating a more active market for digital content and breaking away from some of the artificial constraints that we have at the moment in relation to national boundaries for digital content , there are certainly opportunities that we must take , but in order to do so we need to generate ideas that will encourage Member States to take advantage of them . #% Mr President , I should like to welcome Mrs Diamantopoulou here this afternoon . #% These are the problems of corruption and the reason that we need safeguards put into place . #% The response to the UK-Italian proposal for EU teams of police and immigration officers to work in the western Balkans has therefore been encouraging . #% Could the Commissioner answer one question which was put to me : why , if this is right for air travel , should it not apply to other modes of transport ? #% Mr President , at the last part-session , at exactly this time , Mr Swoboda proposed the abandonment or the curtailment of Question Time . #% Mr Wiebenga 's report has been a model of how we can work constructively between the Commission and Parliament . #% I very much believe that although we are an elected House and the Commission is not , and although the Commission has one part of the policy process and we have another , we in fact have shared interests . #% I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always , as he indicated , worthwhile . #% However , we know that there is many a slip ` twixt cup and lip and that a recommendation to the Commission does not necessarily mean that the Commission , as a collegiate body , will accept it . #% Are we not building another type of discrimination into football , which we really did not need in the first place ? #% It serves as an example of what can be achieved through peaceful negotiation . #% On that , Commissioner , we are with you . #% Mr President , I recommend a vote against Amendment No 12 . #% In regard to the scandal about the presence of nitrofen in grains for organic chickens , we know from information provided between May and July that not all of the Member States were informed with express speed about what had happened . #% Mr De Rossa 's report is concerned with the illegal hunting of endangered species and in no way poses a threat to hunting in the European Union , as the EDD Group amendment claims . #% Take the example of the UK , which comes out quite high in terms of risk of poverty . #% Access is important but too much lip service is paid to access . #% We received a number of petitions from citizens who are not citizens of the national state in which they live . #% I should like to commend Mr Brinkhorst on the detailed work he has put into this . #% I have tried to make it as simple as I can . #% My main concern with the amendments we tabled was to ensure that ordinary consumers would not be disproportionately inconvenienced in carrying out financial transactions , whilst we know that we need to combat money laundering . #% If there are political groups in this Chamber who choose to try and make cheap political capital out of 2 May , we will not forget them in this House and I certainly hope that people in Europe do not forget them . #% The compromise which Mr Karas has engineered in Parliament is one that we can live with . #% We also , as you quite rightly said , need to have answers about whether dozens of children have been incarcerated there , as has been alleged recently . #% I should like to make the point that I was a little disappointed in the Green Paper -- which we look forward to debating in full and due course -- because perhaps not enough recognition was given to the crucial role of nuclear energy in providing the largest share of electricity in the European Union . #% Trade unionists have been killed like the leader of the General Workers Union . #% Mr President , I see the questions today as pertinent and important , because they reflect the general view that there are still concerns about justice , the rule of law and corruption in the two candidate countries under discussion . #% Other countries , which admittedly have lower declared levels of BSE , operate a whole-herd slaughter policy which entails the risk of the under-reporting of cases . #% It is in this context that the Sarkozy-inspired groupe des sages could be put to some serious work to build up some alternative scenarios for the future of the Balkans , but it must not mess up our current commitments . #% You can only set a lead . #% The Spring Council tomorrow needs to bite the bullet and name and shame those Member States who have failed to open up their gas markets . #% You may seek the agreement of Parliament before doing so . #% We live in interesting times . #% I do not argue with the scientific advice , but the processing and marketing of this meat will be almost impossible . #% At half-time millions of kettles are turned on to make a cup of tea - for those who have not been drinking beer since the start of the match at least . #% The other point , colleagues , is that we are not arrogant enough in the Legal Affairs Committee to suggest to you that this is here for all time . #% I thank him particularly for his undertaking to examine my proposal for a European public security force , because there are several organisations across Europe which could offer experience , not least the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland . #% I want to make one point absolutely clear to anyone who shares these worries : this is , after all , a first reading to show we have political priorities and to put some pressure on the Council , it is not the end of the story . #% So there are still outstanding issues . #% In the adaptability pillar of that strategy , to which all Member States have signed up , we agreed to strike a balance between flexibility for companies , of all shapes and sizes , and a degree of security for the workers working within , and moving between , those enterprises . #% Let me make a comment on the fact that two members of the potential Commission have been criticised . #% It is the view of the Bureau and of the Committee on Budgets - and here they are absolutely as one - that in that supplementary and amending budget we should seek to purchase the Belliard I and II buildings so that they can be made available to the Committee of the Regions , to the Economic and Social Committee and to the common structure which , following the Amsterdam Treaty , will be dissolved but which will still have to produce common services to those two committees . #% I commend the directive to the House . #% The United Kingdom has a special interest and responsibility in this area . #% Mr President , I should just like to say that I hope the Conference of Presidents will take serious note of the numbers - or rather lack of numbers - of Members in the Chamber voting on that very important report . #% It is crucial that governance is improved at an institutional level . #% 
The Greek authorities have also imposed disproportionately high administrative penalties and confiscated petitioners ' property , claiming that those concerned were attempting to evade tax payments . #% The preliminary retrial hearing has now been delayed twice , once in July and again in September of this year . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Pakistan is a vital ally for the European Union . #% We must congratulate ourselves in Europe on some progress but not enough has been achieved . #% Does he agree that the review should also look at the cost to public finances if the duty-free regime were to be continued ? #% I believe it is the correct course of action in the circumstance in which we now find ourselves . #% It extends the internal market ; we should not forget that , because it produces more assured consumers . #% It could wreak havoc on South Korea with which it is technically still at war , and it has ten thousand artillery pieces aimed at Seoul . #% Please remember that a negative assessment by Parliament on the final conclusions of the IGC would certainly scupper referendum campaigns wherever they spring up . #% Some MEPs may still want to differ from the Council over the question of the thresholds but we should remember here that we are talking about very tiny amounts . #% The amendment , which has been put down in my name and others , calls for a negotiated settlement of this dispute , which is World Trade Organisation compatible . #% Madam President , perhaps this is outrageous cheek but I want to place on record that at the beginning of the week I raised the matter of a Belgian Government report which looked at religious sects . #% In consultations and negotiations on the complex matters of personnel policy , it is natural of course that some delays have been experienced . #% It struck me that , as the third money laundering directive brought in the notion of proportionate checks of risk sensitivity , we need to make sure that the compliance falls where the really serious risks are . #% But it could come into play earlier if the Indian patent office is not upheld in its line of rejecting patents for minor modifications of older drugs . #% Finally , ferrets . #% It also takes skilled , educated workers from these countries , depriving them of the building blocks of economic development . #% The first is the emphasis on mutual recognition in this area . #% This is a large industry in my own constituency in Lancashire and we have the ludicrous situation at the moment where European companies are working closely with one another but all orders for aircraft are made in dollars rather than in Member States ' own currencies or in the euro #% Mr President , tonight 's report by the Committee on Petitions responds to nine separate petitions received by this Parliament , bearing 43 , 000 signatures , all calling for equal rights for disabled people . #% Sometimes , the opt-out was presented as a standard contract term to new staff , which they would have to take positive steps to avoid . #% On information for enlargement , the Commission proposed EUR 14 million in the budget - a good sum you might think , until you see that the subsidy proposed for bee keeping was EUR 16.5 million . #% The conclusion I draw from this is that in future , to avoid this kind of emotive reaction on an emotive subject , we should have a European Union chemicals agency , which will not be the creature of the Commission , to assess risks . #% You also said that you have a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget , including the British rebate of some EUR 4 billion a year . #% The mandate is important : it is important that the Council gives the Commission a mandate for widespread negotiations , and these are not just negotiations with the Americans , they have to be negotiations with the Chinese and the Indians as well . #% He agreed originally with the Commission that congestion threatens both the environment and the operational working of the whole freight transport sector . #% Our colleague from the Europe of Nations Group , however , claims that this is undemocratic , that it is changing the constitution by means of backdoor deals in closed rooms between the institutions . #% Therefore we can not support horizontal or partial decoupling and as that was an integral part of Mr Cunha 's report , we are unable to support that . #% We in this Parliament should be ashamed that the signal sent out to those few who are listening at this time of night is one of a lack of seriousness on our part . #% We have also to congratulate our colleagues on the trialogue who got the agreement within the interinstitutional agreement on the declarations -- although they do not use that particular word . #% The emergence of China and India on the global trading scene played a huge role in this feat and they continue to lead the developing world by example . #% Mr President , for nine years I have sat in this Chamber and heard lots of pleas for a common foreign and security policy . #% A company based in the Channel Islands , which operates a lot of its activities quite legitimately from the UK mainland , is seriously threatening his business . #% I have been a very strong supporter of cross-border cooperation because of the need to develop those run-down areas which , by virtue of previous hostilities , have always had very little economic activity , and because cross-border cooperation gives a very practical example of the importance of peoples working together . #% . Mr President , I believe it would be right to correct the record as regards Mr Titford 's contribution . #% Kosovo showed us four things above all else . #% Will indeed , above all , the views of ordinary European citizens , be taken into account and listened to in the work of the Convention ? #% The introduction of ethics committees under EU law seeks to ensure the safety of subjects in such trials . #% I do not know about my MEP colleagues but certainly this was one of the criticisms made against the European Union during the British version of the European election campaign . #% I am sure that Parliament will give earnest and informed attention to this and , indeed , all other elements of the reform strategy . #% You had nothing to contribute today . #% Finally , have you had any reports from the FVO in Dublin yet concerning the causes of the outbreak at Heddon-on-the-Wall . #% But we also sound a warning on activation measures , particularly those that sometimes introduce penalties which can have an indirect effect , for example on the families of those affected , or indeed where you find people undergoing several training programmes for work that simply does not exist . #% This financial crisis has hit people across the European Union hard , and therefore it is right that this fund exists . #% There are doubts over the practicability of a European top-up list from 2009 of 10 % of MEPs to be elected on a single European constituency . #% The real tragedy of this debacle is that it is distracting us from even more important work . #% This is about citizens ' rights . #% They quite often add to their take-home pay by doing overtime . #% That would not be fair and it would not be realistic . #% Mr President , Commissioner , for 60 years we have had two traditions in Europe and had no significant health problems . #% They feel the tests they are being put to are unfair . #% Let me add , speaking not just from the viewpoint of the Committee on the Environment but also as farmer , that what we must not do within the European Union - and here I plead with the Commissioner , knowing his views on the way we import and export our products - is to end up putting legislation in place which exports the very industries on which we are legislating now in the EU . #% Could I have your assurance that you will monitor what the industry itself does in these studies ? #% Those who are in favour will vote ` yes ' ; those who wish to abandon their former colleagues will vote ` no ' . #% The cost to the Netherlands alone is immense , tens of millions of euros . #% And , I say to Madame Reding , thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your side . #% In any case , there is no harm in finding this out . #% Funding for these types of programmes are a fundamental step towards this objective of opening the eyes and minds of our young people and preparing them to be part of a flexible , skilled workforce . #% Only the people in this room really know just how much work both the rapporteurs did to reach this final position and to get these two reports as proposals to this Parliament for a final vote . #% I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has now invited MEPs , including myself , to contribute to the reform of the specific NGO co-finance budget line . #% My concern is that I believe these aspects are so important that I certainly would not like to see this directive held up because of arguments over commitology . #% Change is important on the issues of employment guidelines ; I was delighted that the Commissioner again reinforced the importance of the Lisbon Agenda , to which all sides of the House have agreed . #% Our efforts to promote democracy and human rights in the world are founded in the framework of the Democracy and Human Rights Programme . #% We have not clashed over the last few years but have had opportunities to try and solve a lot of problems . #% It is important to show Serbs and other minorities , as well as Kosovar Albanians , that they will be better off in the future . #% The Socialists have tabled a proposal by Mr Lange which was passed by the Environment Committee ( No 30 ) seeking to impose an additional second table of stricter limits for boats on drinking water lakes . #% 
Without being - and certainly not wishing to be - churlish , I would , however , like to suggest that he adds one thing to his list , which appeared to be omitted , and that is the suggestion that there should be much closer cooperation between the competition authorities on this side of the Atlantic and those on the other side , notably the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission . #% Morocco and the Polisario Front both need to understand what is expected of them in terms of standards by the international community . #% In addition , as far as I am concerned , it makes absolutely no sense , when we are dealing with a technical and legal regulation , to be suggesting that it should be doing the work of country strategy papers in the countries that we work with or the work of the national indicative programmes that we work with . #% I am not sure in what political direction you are really heading . #% Nothing I have seen or heard since then has made me change my mind that what we did was not only wrong but also foolish . #% Madam President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for insisting on having a debate on this issue because it is indeed a very important subject . #% I hope that the Erika rapporteurs together can meet the Commissioner soon to help bring forward proposals as to how best Parliament can ensure that Member States comply with their toughened obligations . #% That is paragraph 15 in its entirety . #% We support the overall direction of the Report and accordingly have voted in favour of the report . #% Would she agree that a sign of a civilised society is humane treatment of its animals ? #% I find myself caught between the Scylla of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Council and the Charybdis of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Commission . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I believe that all the wrongs committed by totalitarian regimes - whether fascist , communist or Stalinist - must be thoroughly exposed . #% I am also very uncomfortable with your statement that you would only seek harmonisation of tax in areas `` linked to the single market '' because we know that , if that phrase is interpreted liberally - as the European institutions are inclined to do - practically everything can be said to be linked to the single market . #% Firstly with regard to cement , we have made substantial progress . #% I hasten to add that it is a technical interest and not a financial one . #% My Group believes that it is in the long-term interests of Europe 's citizens . #% We might have to award ourselves a Lisbon medal for stamina at some stage . #% We have a simple choice : either we believe what Saddam Hussein says and believe that he will still go on to disarm in a voluntary way , or we take the hard , difficult decision to commit the lives of our young men and women to enforce the will of the international community . #% Less so this time - and that is because you have done so well - but I would advise future presidencies not to build themselves up into something that they are not , and to get down to the solid work that is necessary for what that post really means . #% Clearly , the size of derivative activity raises questions about how to regulate the industry , so transparency and a harmonised supervisory approach are regarded as very important factors . #% When the people of Ireland rejected the Treaty of Nice in the recent referendum , the most telling slogan was : `` If you do n't know , vote no '' . #% No less important for us is the third priority , dealing with internal policies . #% Therefore , what remains of concern to us is not in the main the contents or analysis within the report but what it says and does not say about the performance of the structural funds programmes themselves . #% So my message on that is to keep your hands off Sellafield . #% So I would say to the Commissioner this afternoon - you have made some progress but I can give you this example to show that a great deal of progress is still needed in this respect . #% They have not , for instance , seen the benefits for their textile and clothing industries , neither have they seen benefits from the liberalisation of trade in farm products . #% This makes President Mugabe ' s refusal to proceed with the lawful land redistribution programme even more deplorable . #% Mr President , I have a one-word oral amendment , which has the support of the rapporteur and hopefully other parties and which I hope is not controversial . #% What is needed is the enforcement of fundamental rights , which are critical here ; the right of access to information in order for you to be completely certain that what has happened to you is not life-threatening . #% When human rights defenders face death threats for upholding their rights , how can evidence show that in Zimbabwe -- scene of political imprisonment , mass evictions and the persecution of journalists -- the European Commission delegation itself said that it was not aware of the EU 's guidelines for human rights defenders ? #% I hope the President will join with me in condemning this extremely heavy-handed reaction and write to my constituent offering the full support of the House in his fight against this nonsense . #% It is often the case that so-called ` freedom struggles ' come to be used by criminal elements who use a political cause as a cover for their activities . #% The Bank has to learn to operate within the same spirit . #% Having made that preliminary remark , I should say that the PPE Group supports the Evans report . #% All too often unscrupulous traders are being tempted to exploit shortcomings in the field of European cooperation . #% Madam President , on 13 December last year an appalling and vicious attack occurred on the parliament of the Indian Union in Delhi , which is their most visible symbol of democracy and secular nationhood . #% It needs to be examined carefully . #% This draft directive belongs to the second of these two worlds . #% Another point of concern - and I have not had an adequate response from the Commission so perhaps Commissioner Monti could address this in his reply - is why the directive only applies to pay TV . #% Last week , with two of my fellow MEPs , I was privileged to meet in Rome , the former King of Afghanistan , who has lived in the European Union for much of his life . #% Peacekeeping remains the key issue . #% If the Commission finds itself resorting to repeated or continued use of this safeguard mechanism , will it consider reviewing negotiations to extend the transfer period ? #% Other amendments include those on the Economic and Social Committee , cutting funds to reduce its dependence on external experts , increasing appropriations for the measures to combat counterfeiting of the euro - something I as a British Conservative have some trepidation in suggesting - and reinstating part of a cut in budget line B1-361 which seeks to improve monitoring and preventative measures in candidate countries concerning agriculture budgets . #% I would urge the Commission in future , when Parliament makes a legislative proposal in this way , to take it up , at least in the majority of cases if not in all of them . #% We want to see a significant reduction in air pollution within a period of time that reflects the serious environmental problems we face . #% Certainly , Russia should be calling on that sort of expertise . #% In fact the situation was so serious in Germany that the head of the German police force was threatening to bring charges of causing serious bodily harm against the German Ministry of the Environment as well as the management of the German nuclear power stations . #% We have historically high levels of unemployment . #% We have all been through them every day . #% Commissioners Flynn and Kinnock are both to be congratulated . #% We support the request for more detailed information to be provided and agree that multi-annual funding is essential to the smooth development of this services . #% In my country we have 3 million people on illegal drugs , 28 % of them are 16-29 year olds , 14 % of them are 14-15 year olds . #% Mr President , I am a severe critic of the damage the EU has done to Britain and a passionate advocate of Britain 's withdrawal from it . #% The imported footwear from China underpins the distribution and manufacturing sections in the Midsomer Norton plant . #% Today is UK Non-Smoking Day , and it seems apt to support this case which is intended to combat large-scale tobacco smuggling which causes revenue losses of several billion euros every year to the EU and Member States ' budgets . #% Batom Mitee continues to be refused visits from his family or any medical care and yet he is paralysed on his left side , can not stand or eat unaided and has lived in the same soiled clothing for over three months . #% The reinstated investigation leading to the EAW saw a failure of the prosecutor to interview witnesses that could clear Mr Assange . #% Madam President , NEPAD and its implementation agency , the African Union , offer , as all of us would agree , no quick fix for the problems of Africa . #% Whilst it might be the Member States jackpot budget it is not something we should be celebrating when we look at the structural funds . #% We are often glibly told , rightly in fact I believe , that we are moving into a knowledge-based society . #% Mr President , the UK Independence Party is probably going to be helpful for the first time ever , so it is nice to be able to make my one-minute speech . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , well President Barroso , you are certainly flexing your muscles , using the powers given to you by the Lisbon Treaty which you pushed through using illegitimate means . #% I am very pleased that my group was among the first to submit proposals to help with its progress . #% However , in the Independence and Democracy Group , we realise that one size will never fit all . #% Our monthly saga of Thursday afternoon urgencies shows a certain lack of coordination and coherence when we are looking at human rights situations #% I thank Mr Ettl for the work he has done on this . #% 
I believe that as things stand the ACP can now hold its own in the budgets on the basis that it is by no means the worst-performing region that we deal with under external relations . #% The BSE crisis happened because the previous government reacted too late to the problem . #% Mr Prodi really has to think about that and perhaps produce proposals for that before Christmas . #% The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people . #% We need to know from the Commissioner how the necessary funding will be allocated this year when the existing funds have dried up for the accession states . #% We will support the pacts in the network insofar as technical assistance is concerned , and there will be quite a number of those . #% In the second case , it will be a rotating system , so that every Member State , large and small , has equal opportunities of seeing one of its nationals serve in the Commission . #% What I would want to see , certainly in the second reading of this directive , is provision for Member States at least to put forward moratoria for five years while that research is taking place . #% Firstly , the sectoral format of the European Coal and Steel Community and its direct involvement with employers , trade unions and other institutions is a great strength . #% Democracy can not exist without competing political forces . #% We have no real public health strategy for the European Union , and this is an important omission , which perhaps we can rectify in other pieces of work . #% One other thing I should like to add to the shopping list is the suggestion that every time there is a transatlantic summit we have a debate like this , with the representative of the Commission and the representative of the Council coming to talk to Parliament , just as they did this afternoon . #% Mr Pronk and I have managed to find a compromise on Amendment No 2 , which has led to a better text . #% At this juncture I should like to raise a couple of points as general rapporteur . #% It is to the Commissioner 's credit that we have come this far , but we have a very long way to go . #% If we try to take on too many of the ambitions harboured in certain quarters , our institutions will be incapable of fulfilling them . #% We have also heard considerable talk today about social Europe , but we have to ensure that social Europe applies to everybody and not simply to those who are in work . #% I will make three quick points regarding that . #% It is clear that rates of technological improvements -- which historically run at about 1-2 % per year -- will be insufficient to offset this enormous growth . #% We must be concerned that this money actually adds to the global efforts and does not simply go into the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies . #% That will help our petitioners and it will be in accord with the Treaty of European Union and the rights of the citizen under that Treaty . #% The Council seems to have very few views on the subject . #% These are not even British dud banks , they are foreign dud banks , and I hear today that the British taxpayer is being asked to fork out for Portugal . #% But until recently we were told that Galileo was for civilian purposes only . #% I hope , Mr Lamy , that you will subscribe to that very important sentiment . #% The burden on business will increase and , worst of all , it will be the European Court of Justice that can legislate and decide on all this . #% Further than this , however , we should reflect on the fact that the European Union played a key role in helping to restore peace in Central America and is cooperating with Latin America as a whole in a bid to achieve both closer relations and development . #% I would hope that the situation that we found ourselves in this time will give us the courage for next year to make proposals which envisage a more transparent system . #% As a regular air traveller , I find that difficult , if not impossible , to believe . #% If we want to look at where that money can come from , I suggest we do a proper cost-benefit analysis on the Economic and Social Committee . #% Mr President , as you may be aware , there were a series of disgraceful riots in Oldham in the summer of 2000 , provoked by members of extreme right wing groups such as the British National Party , the National Front and Combat 18 . #% We have already negotiated access for the media , and EU media experts have been put in position to ensure that takes place . #% They can hear what we are discussing and agree or disagree . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I would like to give my support to Mr Cabrol and also give him my thanks for his report on the Commission proposal . #% Another concern relates to the effects of the regulation on LDCs . #% This punishment is incompatible with the conventions and covenants signed by Nigeria . #% I include in that both the Council and the Commission . #% Its secrecy does a profound disservice to Europe . #% Citizens of many countries have woken up to what has been happening in their name . #% It is a perfectly sensible and good proposal and I commend it to the House . #% On behalf of the Socialist group , I commend this report to the Commission and Parliament as an important new consumer measure . #% We may want to add to its social burdens - and plenty of colleagues over there would like to do that . #% It seems too much of a coincidence that it happened exactly the same this year as it did last year . #% The great white shark is the ocean 's top predator , the lion of the seas . #% We must say to him that on the verge of the next millennium he can not use events which took place in 1389 to justify mass murder today . #% How can that be acceptable when the healthcare and disease pressures are so enormous there ? #% In this context UK Conservatives have been unable to support this report . #% Under the CFP vast fleets of trawlers from countries previously excluded are rapaciously fishing these grounds to extinction , while fertiliser factory ships vacuum up vast quantities of marine life on the seabed , destroying the bottom of the food chain . #% We want the authorities there to investigate links to the military . #% The forum is the wide debate that is taking place with civil society . #% All that would happen - because there are no retrospective elements - is that , as has happened on the Bodensee , the whole of Europe would become pretty much a museum for old engines . #% Insurers should be able to provide insurance for a maximum of 30 days for anyone who wishes to buy a vehicle registered in another Member State and drive it back to their own country to re-register it there . #% The European Parliament will , I am sure , continue to monitor this situation to assess what effects are being felt by other countries , and to do all in its power to ensure that appropriate compensation is forthcoming as necessary . #% I shall be recommending support for many of the rapporteur 's other amendments , but for the reasons I have mentioned above , I can not recommend approval of her overall report . #% I welcome today ' s debate and the European Commission ' s long-awaited communication on human rights . #% We must guard against just such an own-goal . #% Mr President , I should like to begin , perhaps unusually for me , by thanking the various people who have made this evening possible , in particular the Commissioner and all her staff within the maritime unit of her DG , and the maritime safety unit in particular . #% There are many people , lonely people in particular , who are very dependent on the animals with which they share their lives . #% Mr Sonik has just spoken on recital A , but he is supposed to be speaking on paragraph 5 , indent 2 . #% These proposals will cripple British ability to compete in Europe . #% There is a real prospect now of a fresh start to that relationship , which is crucial for world security . #% I have been to Kurdistan . #% They could certainly benefit from implementing the necessary legislative , organisational , administrative and technical measures in the programme as it exists at the moment . #% It arises from the fact that we are legally obliged to meet in Strasbourg 12 times a year . #% I realise that the Socialists may wish to have a split vote on this . #% I now welcome the fact that the Commission has said that it is bringing in additional funding , but will the rules for any new EDCTP budget provisions permit funding to be directed to the development and building of clinical trial sites , including epidemiology studies ? #% 
Here again the Commission has played right into the hands of those who want to drive jobs out of the EU and who pretend that , just because the EU is imposing a ban on sending UCEs within its territory , such a ban will be respected by people in Japan , the Philippines , the USA or anywhere else . #% Mr President , I regret that the Vice-President of the Commission misquoted me . #% Could you perhaps address these points when you respond to our debate later on ? #% Are you saying that the European Union can not be forced to account properly to its paymasters ? #% I have seen no estimates of cost from any of the Greens who tabled these amendments : I do not think any exist . #% It seems to my group that whereas in the 1980s the security partnership underpinned the transatlantic relationship and we had economic differences , now the economic market and integration on trade and investment are underpinning the transatlantic relationship , while the security side is looking somewhat fragile . #% Forget the high-minded pronouncements and look at the implications . #% We have had examples in my country and in Belgium of people being physically threatened , of being blackmailed and in some instances even murdered ! #% You have the information and I suggest that it is not right to allow proper contributions while people are coming into the chamber . #% We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim , as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde , that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only . #% Billions of pounds are spent caring for workers who have been injured or become ill . #% President Aliyev was elected in October 2003 in a contested and deeply-flawed election condemned by international observers . #% I have in mind the 15,000 voters of Gibraltar . #% I agree with Mr Hänsch that we can not carry on endlessly with one IGC dealing with the leftovers of another IGC . #% That was really most difficult . #% I should like to raise a few points on the particular matters of the Commission budget where we would , as a group , be looking for value for money - a tried and tested position with us . #% Neither the temporary bans nor the permanent ban are justified by the evidence . #% This particular fast-track approach - the Ottawa process - should be applauded and I very much hope that we will be able to use it on other occasions . #% I would also like to ask you , President , when the practice for this period of one -- minute statements changed from a ` catch -- the -- eye ' system to one where Members have to put down their names in advance . #% We ought to hear from the Commissioner tonight that there will be measured progress towards effective analysis by the requisite deadline , be that 2004 or later . #% Sixthly , we must intensify regional cooperation in order to ensure that countries are working very closely together so that they become very much inter-related . #% The inclusion of duty drawback clauses has been a concern for many of us , as I mentioned . #% We often do not point out that the `` acquis communautaire ' now covers 80 , 000 pages of text and 20 , 000 legal acts . #% At present there are about five million people under the age of 25 who do not have the passport to the labour market that a good qualification or indeed a good certificate or schooling would grant them . #% The Socialists see voluntary agreements as having a complementary role to legislation , but not as a substitute for it . #% We think that passengers should be compensated for unjust delays and that their rights in these cases should be clear and well known . #% It seems unreasonable and incompetent to expect people to be here on time and then not to operate . #% The EUR 300 million a year spent on bringing Parliament here for part-sessions amounts to EUR 2 billion over a financial perspective . #% To me there must be no discrimination between Turkey and the other states that are trying to accede to the Union . #% We welcome the fact that Commissioners Bolkestein and Liikanen are looking at various pilot projects in this area . #% I support the establishment of a temporary committee , but we have to be careful not to bolt the stable door after the horse has bolted . #% Madam President , this is a debate , or it should be . #% There are , however , three points that still remain of concern to us . #% That is our role as a grown-up legislator : to think about new ideas , encourage change and not necessarily , as Lord Inglewood said , go along with an accepted wisdom that has been with us for many years . #% The EU suspension of parts of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , the arms embargo and visa restrictions represent and categorically show to the world that this European Union can and will uphold human rights . #% All that appears on just the first page of his recommendations . #% Speedy decisions are those based on high-quality procedures and efficiency such as that offered by the functioning immigration service computers which the UK lacks - not on removing appeal rights for all applicants . #% The EU argues that the IMO code of conduct is not legally binding and a proposed EU Directive has ensued , which I have voted against . #% The EU-China statement on 11 September was encouraging , but it needs to be built on . #% The Socialist Group has always made it clear that we believe that Russia should be fully involved and I fully support its latest peace mission . #% That is why it is so important to keep in the reserved sector the integrated collection , sorting , distribution and final delivery of the mail as well as cross-border mail and direct mail . #% There is , however , one area in which the Commission should maintain its vigilance , and that concerns provision of care for orphans . #% The tax matter should continue to be subject to a unanimous vote . #% I now implore the Commission to take the necessary further action , including legal action against the French government , as a matter of urgency . #% That is why we want to see an immediate moratorium on any deployment of LFAS by navies of any NATO country and we want a comprehensive and independent impact assessment to take place . #% He still feels it imperative that we concentrate on practical ways to defuse these bottlenecks , especially at ports . #% Then we learned that such an examination did not amount to an investigation . #% Try to explain it to members of the general public and - even if you can do it - how are they to understand it ? #% Mr President , I am very pleased to be able to respond to this strategic document on behalf of my group . #% This pact should not have rigid rules but should at least encourage stability . #% To coin a phrase , the liberalising talk is ` all spin and no delivery ' . #% People from several African countries say that everyone knows the huge fraud taking place in their waters under these EU agreements . #% All the points expressed in the various amendments are already sensibly covered . #% Therefore , it is to be regretted , as the Commissioner said , that we are seeing a cut in the budget . #% As to the criminalisation of the client , which somebody suggested earlier , in the United Kingdom homosexuality was made legal in order to do away with what was then known as a ` blackmailer 's charter ' . #% It is worth noting that we have had 77 airline bankruptcies in the European Union since 2000 and , in the sad but likely event that some more may follow in this tough economic climate , we believe it is imperative that we use this question tonight to at least open up the debate now about how we can best protect consumers and air travellers in the European Union . #% I also regret - and she may regret - the submission of the programme to full codecision because that has certainly lengthened the process without adding to the substance . #% The Commission statement this morning can not bind the future Commission which will be holding office when the directive comes into force . #% One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued . #% They are for possible use once accession has taken place . #% Mr President , Colombia - one of South America 's oldest democracies and a country which , unusually for this continent , has not been prone to military dictatorship - is tragically a victim of 37 years of civil war and terrorist activity , which have destroyed infrastructure , killed 40 000 people and corrupted its civil and military authorities through guerrilla involvement with the drugs trade . #% If so , why does Britain have lower quotas in the waters around our shores than some other countries from further afield ? #% I want to declare a special interest in SOLVIT . #% The welfare problems of actually handling chicken also have to be considered . #% -- Mr President , this is a very difficult one to call . #% Some differences between these two snapshots emerge however . #% 
It is not working at the moment in Essex . #% As so many speakers have said , on the economic front , Stockholm was a great disappointment . #% I understood that there was also a move by the Council of Ministers and the Commission to move this budget towards Parliament 's financing . #% I believe we will see more cases of this kind until we recognise that the way forward is through a system of quotas that enables everyone to benefit from trade , rather than just a few . #% Of course , legislative proposals can be for a longer period , but five years would allow us to sort out our policies on expenditure and own resources . #% The Chairman of the Kimberley Process , Mr Mathieu Yamba from the Democratic Republic of the Congo , has decided unilaterally , and without consultation , to allow the marketing of diamonds from Zimbabwe 's Marange mine . #% What do we want to look at and how are we going to achieve it ? #% I personally have amended many reports and resolutions calling for action , spoken in plenary on this issue a dozen times and tabled countless parliamentary questions . #% However , I also saw the overall picture as reported by the OSCE election observation mission . #% If France had new evidence as to the safety of British beef why did the French Government not bring this information to the Commission before the ban was lifted in August 1999 - why wait until now and delay and delay and delay ? #% Since it is very likely that the majority of those who take up these opportunities will be young people , it is particularly important that health and safety aspects are considered . #% I welcome the fact that the Council is meeting to discuss that . #% There must be an proper ongoing debate on the kind of Europe we want to build . #% Indeed , as he says , we have reached a very satisfactory outcome . #% Mr President , the situation in Darfur is extremely grave . #% How much time , energy and problems were caused for staff in the running of a programme simply because the Commissioners did a deal between themselves which was not transparent , not effective and certainly unaccountable to us here in the European Parliament . #% We should be thanking and congratulating all those millions of people in Britain and throughout Europe who give blood . #% On some airlines measures are taken to protect passengers - for example by spraying cabins - on others they are not . #% Many of us believe that any government in our country will encourage the construction of waste incinerators as an alternative to encouraging the alternatives . #% Unfortunately , the Fernández-Albor report 's biggest weakness is the call for a common deterrent . #% I do not intend to be known as the Chairman of the Budgets Committee who sold out those rights for such a small amount of money . #% Part of the problem -- and I sense it in a lot of the discussions here -- is that many colleagues are not accepting the fact that in almost every field of technological invention , there is some form of digital technology . #% This principle has already been accepted by the European Parliament in the Randzio-Plath report , and I call for the Commission 's support in the decisions to be taken before the end of this year . #% We are rightly distressed by his murder and the reaction to it by part of the population of Pakistan , but we should not forget , as well , that many have mourned him and have done that in public as a public act . #% This has been reflected in the consistent line this Parliament has taken in the past . #% Mr President , in the time available , as Mr Salafranca will understand , I would like to concentrate on paragraph 7 of the resolution on the urgent and overriding need to keep support for the peace process in Colombia as a priority within this strategy . #% With the Commissioner 's help - and I pay tribute to him , and I can share his sense of exasperation - we went into a process of negotiation when many said we should not . #% The Isle of Wight similarly has great people but GDP is just 67 % of the European average . #% However , the right balance needs to be struck between their interests , those of the commercial and non-commercial growers and the need to certify conservation seeds , that is , seeds of plants useful for biodiversity . #% If we really want to do business across Europe together we have to be fair and reasonable with one another . #% There is a continuing role for incineration within the waste management hierarchy , but its role needs to be constantly reviewed . #% The motivation was mixed , relating both to the desirability of the changes themselves and the desirability of making them in the course of a one-year extension of the programme . #% What they want to see first are the good effects that could come from the Uruguay Round . #% We reject the Charter of Fundamental Rights - with its vague rights to jobs , health and social security - becoming legally binding . #% That can fall flat on its face , and if does so , then public confidence is lost . #% What we need now is a full review , not just of the working procedures of the WTO , which you have rightly called medieval , but of its trade rules themselves , which I would call imperialist . #% Is disability a priority of the Commission ? #% In 1997 the Commission purported to give itself a further power of delay and that was extended , although challenged , because all of us here - and everyone who serves as I do on the Conciliation Committee - agree with the rapporteur in acknowledging the difficulties which arise where there are not yet viable alternatives to some forms of animal testing . #% Its predecessor , PACT , was very popular in the United Kingdom with both the public and the private sectors . #% I welcome the decision taken concerning Turkey - although I would have preferred the date of 1 May 2004 - but this must become a defining moment in our relations with Turkey . #% We need to look at motor electronics , further improvements in vehicle safety , electric and hybrid vehicles , lightweight vehicle structures and materials , optimizing of production techniques , and systems for the recycling of all vehicles . #% Last year , counterfeit EUR 500 notes rose by over 160 % , and that is only the ones we know about . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for the reply he has given me but it does not reassure me at all . #% I welcome the discussions which took place at the G7 and the expressions of concern about poverty in the Third World and ACP countries . #% Were these earlier dates that the Commission is proposing actually requested by the new Member States ? #% EU 2020 objectives can be achieved by investing in programmes that provide young people with a wide variety of opportunities and promote labour market mobility . #% I wrote to you last week drawing your attention to a letter which was addressed to you , dated 28 October , from President Santer of the Commission . #% We were told several weeks ago that today was the deadline - and yes , the Commission has initiated proceedings . #% Drift and indecision have been a fundamental characteristic of the British Presidency . #% South Africa , in particular , needs to exercise some real moral and political leadership . #% This is a feeling felt by many Member States with regard to the Schengen area and we should not rush with further expansion before all involved are fully and sufficiently ready and prepared . #% I personally , and the EPLP Group , could wholeheartedly support something like the compromise Amendment No 5 which Mrs Kauppi put forward in committee ; but I am afraid if Amendments Nos 3 and 4 were adopted here in Parliament this week , we would see this legislation fall . #% Not simply did Mr Tannock go on to criticise the Turkish Prime Minister directly , but I believe his remarks could be regarded as offensive to Muslims and in general to the Turkish victims of the attack , irrespective of their religion . #% This debate goes to the very heart of what the EU is all about , and it is becoming perfectly obvious that no nation can control its own borders , decide its own immigration policy , and at the same time remain part of the European Union . #% Hezbollah represents significant public support in Lebanon , and our hope should be that Hezbollah rejects terrorism and embraces the political process . #% I welcome the call for a Green Paper on child poverty . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work . #% These 13 who were arrested were arrested in secret ; nobody knew of their whereabouts for two or three months . #% Although some progress has been made on this matter since the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in 1999 , the matter is still unresolved . #% I would also like to thank the services of our committee which helped me a very great deal and indeed the ECB itself which kindly entertained me in Frankfurt for a day and told me where my report was going wrong . #% We look to the Commission to spend the money that they have efficiently and effectively . #% I am not as convinced as he is that the violence is actually over in Fiji . #% We must realise that it will be virtually impossible - and certainly it will be impracticable - to forge agreement between 25 or 30 states upon essential questions of sovereignty . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , so , we need another initiative do we ? #% Of more concern has been the harassment of opposition print media and impeded access to state and private TV coverage . #% What universities think of this seems to be immaterial . #% 
I thank you again . #% I was personally responsible for introducing a paragraph asking the Council and Member States to take more effective action over the human rights catastrophe caused by the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe . #% In the main , I think the Swedish Presidency , and indeed the motion itself , have good ideas , but unfortunately , as usual , we go on providing ourselves with massive Christmas trees where very little can actually , therefore , be achieved . #% The proposals that we have before us take matters forward but perhaps they do not go far enough . #% In terms of justice and home affairs I do not think we should be looking for a harmonised system across the European Union . #% At some point in the future it might be necessary to place a moratorium on trees under this scheme being put on to the market so that we do not in the future damage the wood industry . #% The Labour Government ' s record in Britain is also a proud one . #% However , my committee had some concerns about the lack of a proper cost benefit analysis , or an adequate impact assessment of the costs arising from this directive . #% The first is one that we have specifically asked you about as an aspect of a modern public organisation : a policy for whistle-blowing - and the English terminology is now being widely accepted as a very good way of identifying a policy where officials believe and are confident that if they find wrongdoing they can report it without fear of recrimination or their careers being affected . #% Mr President , my name does not appear on the list of Members present yesterday , although I do appear on every list of recorded votes . #% China is planning on reducing its carbon intensity by 45 % over the next decade . #% Madam President , I rise under Rule 174 , the right to petition the European Parliament . #% It would not be surprising , given the changes , that there are some people who feel uncomfortable with this . #% I hope you will raise the matter with the British authorities . #% What are you doing about the one Member State that apparently is doing nothing about it ? #% I would also like to ask what exactly you suggest that we , as parliamentarians , can do in cooperation with the Commission to ensure that governments make parliamentary activity more of a priority . #% It is our industrial emissions that have led directly to acute climate change in the region , and we now threaten to impose our values and our traditions on the peoples of the Arctic at this very sensitive moment . #% I wish her no harm . #% I know that we will want to follow up this issue . #% He asked us quite rightly to say what has changed . #% Nor do I believe that we should be asking Ireland to negate its recent referendum and prepare for the ratification of the Nice Treaty . #% There is nothing for them in the current European Constitution . #% Is that harmonisation , or is it not ? #% I am afraid the postponement of the Statute may stand in the way of that . #% Deliveries of heavy fuel oil , the US contribution to KEDO , have , in the past at least , been sporadic . #% What does a Member State have to fear from explaining to its own parliament why the minister voted as he or she did ? #% The rest of the article is far from perfect , but provides the basis for some serious work over the next five years . #% Firstly , I want to mention the costs . #% It is a sign that Parliament has recognised that the end of the Cold War has brought with it an entirely new concept of security and that environmental security is crucial to future peace and prosperity . #% We would be interested to hear what involvement is foreseen , and at what point , for the social partners from the accession countries . #% They need us to support their ability to voice any concerns . #% We have a wealth of culture and creativity in Europe which needs to be fostered and developed . #% We should ensure that there is a direct link between the price of fish and the cost to consumers , but simply subsidising unsustainable practices is not the way to reduce the over-fishing which has caused the economic problems in the first place . #% It is fully in the interests of Europe 's citizens that the American security forces be allowed to interrogate these suspects . #% I call on all those with any sense to oppose these measures . #% It is incumbent upon the Member States to help us ensure that European taxpayers ' money is being spent correctly . #% Thus , whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown , Labour ' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same . #% I very much hope and indeed encourage the House to approve our version of the report tomorrow because it addresses a number of the issues that the Commission asked us to address and it was not intended as the forerunner of the PSE Group 's manifesto for the forthcoming elections . #% We must still ensure that the financial arrangements actually work and we must also ensure that Parliament 's role in those financial arrangements is fully respected . #% We have responded with directives to events that have caused us to be concerned about tunnel safety and pipeline safety . #% But if we are serious about integrating international trade and sustainable development , then the very minimum we need to do is to ensure that representatives from social affairs , from environment , from development ministries have their voices heard at 133 meetings as well . #% This proposal is not perfect : it poses many questions in regard to existing legislation and highlights areas where existing legislation is inadequate . #% Is it not time to ban all flag-of-convenience ships once and for all , not just from EU ports but from EU waters as well ? #% I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fajon , the rapporteur . #% It is easier for everyone to say yes rather than no , but at this stage it seems that no member of the European Council wishes to say yes to Turkey , but none wishes to say no either . #% Therefore , it is a great idea . #% Among the rights that he will include in that , I am sure , will be the rights to have proper checks on health professionals and on the facilities , hospitals and clinics to which people may be going . #% This is not a question of whether or not health and safety at work is an important issue . #% We support , of course , educational exchanges of Erasmus , Socrates and so on in the European Educational Institute in Florence , but not enough students get the opportunity to experience Europe . #% Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists , which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders ? #% We could not , however , support this particular text , as the tone of the recitals in particular is unbalanced and overly alarmist . #% We will however be rejecting some of her amendments , notably those that seek to extend the system to all financial plans , to defence and civil defence , to consultation beyond what is reasonable and to the general policies she has just mentioned , which become more of a wish-list than firm proposals . #% We are here to do a job and it should be recorded both for the archives and for television just like any other session . #% Nevertheless , I wish the euro well as the currency of our major trading partners , since UK prosperity is also affected by its stability . #% Before anyone tells me that euro notes do not exist , it would not make any difference : they could not write anything . #% I know that many of my colleagues - for reasons that I respect - will wish to take a different view , but I urge everyone in deciding how to vote on this report to bear in mind just how imperative the need for conservation has become . #% Madam President , if Mrs Dührkop Dührkop can wax lyrical at this late hour I am sure you will allow me a little bit of levity if I say first of all that Commissioner Liikanen has virtually stolen my speech . #% Second , and crucially , a separate closed system for aviation is crucial at the very least as a pilot scheme because , apart from the administrative difficulties of including aviation in the EU 's general ETS , many sectors already in that scheme are concerned about the possible effect of aviation 's inclusion on carbon prices , noting that as a sheltered sector , aviation will be able tolerate higher prices than many others . #% Thinking about what is in this report , a number of messages have come through . #% In the United Kingdom , over 160 000 people have signed a petition against war organised by a national newspaper , the Daily Mirror . #% Mr President , this rehashed directive will be decided during the Presidency of Austria , which has no ports at all . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I do not expect that I will take up six and a half minutes on this matter , but I would like to thank Mr Corbett for nobly standing in to prosecute a cause for which I think he personally lacks a certain degree of enthusiasm , and to thank Mr Friedrich who , with his customary courtesy , is declining to upset current postholders by ousting them from the positions that they enjoy in Parliament . #% Mr President , I am sure that the rapporteur will speak for himself but this group feels that it is important to mention the free movement of workers , but not necessarily in the main text . #% Secondly , the current policy framework artificially subsidises aviation and therefore stimulates this growth still further . #% More recently I visited Finland to see the forestry industry at work as the guest of CEPI , the Confederation of European Paper Industries . #% It is typical of this Parliament that we call for an end to unemployment yet we promote actions that have the opposite effect . #% 
There is no point pretending we can automatically run to big leaps forward when in fact only a handful of countries collect batteries at all . #% We are arguing here about two years . #% In conclusion , I should like to thank all my colleagues for their serious work and commitment on this report , whether we agreed or not . #% I particularly ask the Commissioner two things : firstly , will you accept that there is a European dimension to this ? #% To ensure that there is complete clarity on the subject something that did not come through in all the speeches I repeat : taking , if you like , Mr Bayona de Perogordo 's suggestion that there should be a transitional approach , I would simply say that we have done rather better than adopt a transitional approach . #% I wish to pay a strong tribute to my friend , Mr Patten , who I see has left to see the doctor already . #% I implore the African Union and the African countries to use all the resources at their disposal to persuade Mugabe and his clique to step aside . #% Not until we can secure changes in those laws - and this is gradually occurring - can we take substantial further steps beyond the significant steps that we are seeking to take in the course of this reform and which honourable Members have been good enough to acknowledge . #% I am very happy to restate Parliament 's support for the development of a European framework on corporate social responsibility . #% It is also 2.10 p.m. ! #% Anybody who has spent any time with young children and babies will know that they put anything in their mouths so that false division had to go -- as did this idea of children aged under three and over three , which we discussed in our committee . #% How can that be sensible ? #% If it had not worked we would not have Mr Frattini here with us today to take part in this debate , and it is with pleasure that I welcome him . #% Mr President , I rise on the same point of order . #% Please take that as the first message , because we need to win the hearts and minds of the people out there , who think that we produced a diluted and weak piece of legislation . #% So here is a simple one for him to make : maintain the culture of secrecy or put the principles of openness and transparency into practice . #% We need to think clearly and recognise that some of our sustainable development policies could potentially conflict with others . #% I must point out to our colleagues and comrades alike , in agreement with Mrs Hermange , that indeed we can not force one model on all countries across the European Union . #% I repeat the call for the EU to offer its services as a facilitator to both sides and to take account of the relevant UN resolutions . #% This is an important issue . #% Let us be clear about that . #% Mr President , what you have just said has given us a lot of comfort and security . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Färm , who is a true friend of development . #% India is fast becoming the prime south-Asian geopolitical player and it is high time that the UN Security Council admitted the largest democracy in the world to its ranks as a permanent member . #% Recognising that Turkey 's accession negotiations will take many years and that substantial reform is needed , there are many elements of the Eurlings report that I can support . #% Currently the EU is spending over half its budget on State aid . #% Let us recognise the possibility of failure . #% I want to congratulate Mrs Marinucci on what she has had to say about these matters for our committee and , indeed , for the Parliament . #% Indeed , it is not an exaggeration to say that voter indifference remains the greatest long-term threat to the European Union as a whole and perhaps to this Parliament in particular . #% It is also actually as Mr Bowis probably knows , the view of the UK Government - in the advice that it circulates to us and is more frequently sometimes copied on that side of the House than on this - that a reduction to 250 mg measurement may be necessary . #% We have to recognise that economics is starting to transform Chinese society . #% Could you confirm that was the case ? #% It is high time that the programme 's health research agenda was broadened to include more common diseases : most people have had contact , close or otherwise , with diseases such as cancer , degenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases . #% Seventy-six countries now recognise the Sahrawi Democratic Republic . #% in writing . - I supported the report on a European youth strategy as I believe it will prove vital in getting young people into full-time employment over the coming years . #% When your mind is made up facts only confuse the issue ! #% I have to say , from our position as a Parliament , that the Council 's common position was a disappointment - especially when you consider that we share the same aim . #% Kazakhstan 's current chairmanship of the OSCE has helped to enhance the organisation 's profile and refocus our attention on Central Asia and , in particular , on the issue of security and the fight against international terrorism . #% How can we expect an individual who has suffered torture , humiliation or sexual degradation to express that in a language in which they can just get by . #% Whilst we are looking at questions on the legal basis , this is not the only issue where the question of Parliament 's involvement arises . #% Such public service provision is , of course , the groundwork upon which pride in industry can build , create , develop and flourish . #% Essentially , this report should lead to a more sensible preventative - rather than curative - approach to asbestos poisoning and it could potentially result in much lower figures of workers affected . #% in writing . - Both young and old people alike should have access to vocational education and training . #% Madam President , can I add my congratulations to both Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Daskalaki for their excellent reports . #% The prosecutor has said : ` Even though this new evidence may establish Mr Richey 's innocence , the Ohio and United States Constitution nonetheless allows him to be executed because the prosecution did not know that the scientific testimony offered at the trial was false and unreliable . ' #% It almost feels as if the neo-liberal dogma and ideology are getting the better of the facts on the ground . #% It is only when we work with such authorities , who have vital in-depth knowledge of regional employment needs and peculiarities at their disposal , that we shall be able to reap the potential benefits outlined in this report . #% Why , Commissioner , are we not asking questions ? #% Our chair has been a very good Solomon and a very good United Nations diplomat during his time . #% Certainly Parliament as a whole was of similar mind , hence the Conciliation Committee on which I was privileged to serve . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for its extremely strong and clear statement on the unfortunate Zana case . #% Can he count on their support in achieving this communication ? #% The election of President Lukashenko in 1994 led initially to the hope that authority would be upheld , corruption rooted out and the economy put back on track . #% So far as the September communication is concerned , it is unprecedented . #% We need much greater cooperation . #% However , we were obliged to vote against the proposal in relation to the European Arrest Warrant . #% The floods in Bangladesh , and I have seen them , come nearly every year , but this year have caused some USD 2.2 billion damage . #% There is still very significant room for improvement . #% This is a clear signal that the Labour government is surrendering control of foreign policy to the European Union . #% Research shows that deaths from leukaemia resulting from the Chernobyl explosion have been one hundred times more than predicted by the relevant radiological protection boards , which have based their predictions on external rays . #% In the fight to clean up our planet , Britain 's Labour Government has , of course , been at the forefront . #% Therefore , if Britain is ever going to embrace the euro , the ECB must also embrace greater openness . #% The perpetrators of these atrocities do not represent the people of India or mainstream Hinduism . #% We must accept that there are some forms of hazardous waste that can be well disposed of in cement kilns and that is where it should go , but under the strictest of controls . #% There are areas in which we tread very much on the Committee on International Trade 's territory , but the report takes a much more protectionist line than that committee 's recent report . #% We stand ready , President Barroso , to work with you to achieve those goals . #% 
Having passed through the Amsterdam summit meeting we then need to have the Council instruct the Commission to come forward with measures that activate the policies that would be available to bring down the levels of unemployment . #% Mr President , I would prefer that we would have had no directive whatsoever on whole-body vibration , because even the ISO Standard report says there is no quantitative link between whole-body vibration and lower back pain . #% I do so against the background of articles published in the British Medical Journal in the United Kingdom . #% One of the things that worries the MEPs who have visited the Food and Veterinary Office is that it is very understaffed . #% The first is that of Colombia . #% Modern , big EU trawlers force these local fishermen out of business , landing catches at prices with which they can not compete . #% The problem is that the first ten questions deal with an issue that is not a matter for the Council , i.e. the Elgin Marbles , and therefore I am asking you to rule the first ten questions out of order as they are clearly a matter for bilateral discussions between the Member States concerned and not a matter for the Council . #% What is so shocking about developments in some Member States is the crude official intolerance : the banning of Pride demonstrations , inflammatory language even by Prime Ministers , police failure to protect marches , and so on . #% You wrote to Mr Blair on 20 October with five proposals to relaunch negotiations , and the British Presidency has followed those to the letter , including accepting that in 2008 there will be a complete review of the EU budget , when the whole of the UK rebate will be on the table . #% As we move towards a world in which more and more goods are coming into the European Union from countries , such as China , that are new members of the World Trade Organisation and where intellectual property enforcement is at best very weak , we have to be able to protect ourselves in a legitimate and balanced way . #% The rapporteur is reacting to representations by the European Consumer Bureau , which says it is putting the case for allergy sufferers and clearly sees the issue as part of its war on chemicals . #% However , the lesson for us within Parliament is that Spinelli 's method was one of trying to build up consensus . #% While we understand and appreciate that many issues we tackle over the next few months will be very difficult , please do not let us delay . #% All these measures must be considered in relation to the needs and wishes of these consumers in a way that ensures that environmental concern is at the very top of the agenda . #% I would like to address my remarks to two particular dimensions of the SAB , firstly on the consumer health policy unit , and secondly on the transfer of funds for the trademarks agency in Alicante . #% I hope that , at last , a just solution to this 58-year dispute over Kashmir can be found , involving both Pakistan and India but , above all , the Kashmiri people who have suffered enough already . #% I mention that point not to denigrate the discussions on the Constitution , which are important but , rather , to emphasise that the endless institutional debate that we have does not bring us closer to the electorate because it does not address the issues which voters regard as very important . #% It may be a good debating point to say that it is belated , but that really does not have much foundation . #% It is an important measure to regulate the quality , safety and procedures for cells and tissues used for transplants . #% In that regard , why should we not seek to extend those common standards to our major trading partner across the Atlantic ? #% Having said that , as part of the essential process of making Europe 's political activities more clear , understandable , democratic and accountable and making Europe suitable for an enlarged Union , it is necessary that this work is done and done rigorously . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , in recent years , academic and political focus on culture and education has increased dramatically , with analysis consistently highlighting these areas to be crucial not only in encouraging economic growth and social cohesion , but also in facilitating mobility for young people across Europe . #% I am aware of the wide range of views , both for and against . #% The Commissioner would say that it is very important . #% That is a project that certainly has been very successful and they are delighted to have received European support . #% Lastly , I would just like to say one small thing on the question of damages . #% They were then propelled forward by some superb cross-party work by rapporteurs in this Parliament and fixed as a result of innovative negotiating skills on the part of the Belgian presidency and from Mr Daems - who contrived to include a gastronomic tour of Brussels in his valiant efforts to secure consensus . #% That is another very important part of the Radwan report which we , as MEPs , should recognise . #% I would also be in favour of retrieving the proposed powers to increase the influence of national parliaments and of more transparency in the co-legislative process in the Council of Ministers , whose current behaviour is far too secretive . #% In particular we must keep youngsters from being exposed to enticements to drink . #% Let us not forget that we are talking about humanitarian aid , not development aid in total . #% We need a new chemicals policy . #% Constructive suggestions for improvement will be welcome and , as the record plainly shows , we heed them and we are ready to include them before decisions are finalised by the college . #% I refer you to the amendments that I have submitted on that issue . #% I welcome this excellent initiative taken under the British Presidency . #% One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective , smooth , calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union . #% I understand there is some hesitation and a little confusion among our Socialist colleagues -- due to the swiftness of the changes in the situation in Romania -- on how to vote . #% I feel this especially keenly as only on Tuesday evening of this week my 27-year-old daughter , Caroline , was selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for the Southampton Itchen constituency in the United Kingdom . #% If not , then surely we do not even need a European Food Agency : we can just legislate on the basis of the precautionary principle . #% Mr President , nothing I say today will be very popular with the grand alliance of legitimate concerns for the third world , distaste for the single market and economic interests masquerading as high principle which has dominated this debate today . #% People in my region of North-East England want criminal law to be made by accountable British parliamentarians and applied by British judges . #% Estimates vary about the success of Iraqi efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems but few analysts doubt Saddam ' s determination to acquire such a capability and many expect him to achieve some success within the next four years . #% One has to ask what trust can anyone place in EU pledges if this is an example of non-delivery . #% Looking to the future , we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission . #% We are building quite a broad consensus on the bulk of the proposals contained in my report . #% It is with some sadness that we note that not all the amendments tabled by the Legal Affairs Committee in this regard were adopted . #% Yet every year the EU takes more of the powers of nationhood . #% The first issue is that of religious minorities , the second is that of prisoners . #% It is tragic that two large MEP groups have passed this in a single reading rather than have a thorough scrutiny . #% In relation to Bosnia and Kosovo , are we simply going to carry on as before , or are we going to look at enhancing our work there in order to better secure our borders ? #% Instead they should remember the free Czechs and Poles who helped my country free the continent of Europe from another similar tyranny sixty years ago . #% We must make sure that enlargement incorporates the necessary institutional changes . #% This must be understood , not just by the Council of Ministers and the European Council , but also by the Court of Justice . #% We are also calling for all attacks on journalists to cease . #% One , of course , is the 20 % threshold . #% With the euro area accounting for around 20 % of the world 's output and the world 's largest importer and exporter , it is essential that we have economic reforms within the European Union that are going to make the single currency a success . #% It makes sense . #% Economic and democratic development in three of the four countries has been weak . #% In the case of textiles and clothing , we clearly need to go even further , because some of the poorest countries will face enormous shocks when the Multifibre Agreement is withdrawn . #% I do not see how anyone can be opposed to that . #% Although we supported paragraph 9 , we feel the proposal for sanctions showed up weaknesses at the heart of the purely intergovernmental procedures currently in force . #% For an institution that tells us that what was agreed in Berlin was set in concrete , I think the Council has a bit of a cheek in moving large sums of money from the MEDA programme which they agreed 12 months ago and then lecturing us about what can and can not be moved . #% However , since the Baroness is in this position , she should take account of the fact that the EU signs deals worth billions of euro with countries that are among the worst persecutors of Christians . #% Starting off in Britain , which still has a poor recycling record , the WEEE Directive looks like the future . #% The approach of the UK Government with respect to the culls was approved by the European Commission . #% We are really a long way from being able to achieve that . #% 
You can not pick and choose when to enforce state aid rules and can not add state aid . #% You say he pulled a gun on you and what happened was self-defence on your part . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , High Representative , Iran to me represents the most serious threat to global security . #% The trouble with the Council is that everything revolves around what was agreed at Berlin . #% That is an abuse of the position that we hold here . #% Of course , the illnesses and deaths must be investigated and I welcome the action taken by NATO member states to that end , but we have to make a judgment on the facts and the facts are very clear at the moment . #% So , if we move to satellite technology there could be very real technical problems in operating it , not only in London but also in other urban environments which may introduce similar schemes . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs favours an optional instrument , a second EU contract law for all citizens and enterprises . #% That is a safety precaution we should retain . #% Mr President , I do not wish to delay this House too much longer , but I would like to make one trenchant point . #% There can be no doubt that , in the recent riots in Xinjiang province , many innocent Han Chinese were brutally murdered . #% Countries are perfectly capable of establishing their own humane criteria for asylum seekers and of managing their own security systems . #% The Commission has rightly made provisions for unreasonable profit-taking to be avoided . #% In the Foreign Affairs Committee we rejected not only those amendments but the offending clauses in the opinions of the Women 's Rights and Civil Liberties Committees as well . #% I reject the technical steps that take the European Union closer into the tax affairs of Member States , just as I reject the ultimate objective of allowing the European Union to levy taxes on individuals in the European Union . #% If we need any reminder of that , we need only look at the thousands who die each year from taking authorised prescription medicines . #% Most are treatable , most people can lead fairly full lives but only if , every three weeks of their life for as long as they live , they have an infusion of immunoglobin which comes from human plasma and that keeps them alive . #% Today we will be debating two draft directives , including the prospectus directive , on which I have the honour to be Parliament 's rapporteur that incorporate the delegated powers proposed by Baron Lamfalussy 's wise men . #% Our commitment to the defeat of terrorism must be no less than theirs . #% We should celebrate the high turn-out in those elections and the fair way in which they were conducted , although we should still register our concern at the severe reduction of the franchise in the functional constituencies and the possibilities for abuse of corporate voting in the functional constituencies through the registration of shell companies . #% We are making progress towards a system of civil law and justice that will give ease and certainty of access across Member State boundaries , at last beginning to make a reality of the area of freedom and justice proposed at Tampere . #% I would , at this point , also like to pay tribute to our current chairman Mr Libicki , who has carried on the good work of our previous chairman . #% We need to be able to take account in our budgetary policies of the effects of what is happening elsewhere in the world . #% Mr President , I would like to focus my contribution to this debate on the essence of what the proposal means to people in my constituency . #% In particular , I am glad that you have been listening to the representations of the least-developed countries and that all options remain on the table . #% When we talk about trying to take Cyprus and Malta out of category 4 and put them where they should belong , you are not interested . #% He is doing a lot of very good work in terms of emergency assistance there , but the safe and protected return of internally displaced people in that country is crucial and it is bizarre that they do not include that in their plans . #% in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues welcome the need for effective inter-governmental co-operation within the CFSP , provided the United Kingdom retains its veto and ability to act alone in its national interest when required . #% The United States continues to out-perform us and the competitive challenges from Asia , particularly China and India , are increasing , with no apparent urgent response from national capitals in our Union . #% It trains , arms and sends out that terrorist group and has done so for a long time now . #% These are the challenges of today . #% Mr President , once again this year the increase in funds committed to pre-accession in category 4 means an overall decline in Europe 's external action devoted to development . #% On that basis I did not table any such amendment here but would highlight Amendment No 16 in the Hans-Peter Mayer report which specifically covers all issues , therefore including consultation issues . #% Growth alone is not the solution to social deprivation and it never has been . #% We in the EU believe in open borders and free trade as a sine qua non for peace and stability on our continent and also in the South Caucasus . #% Unfortunately , the PUK , the other main Iraqi Kurdish Party is every bit as guilty since it had previously cooperated with Iranian revolutionary guards in attacking the camps of Iranian Kurds who have been mercilessly persecuted by the Iranians and then conducting a vicious military campaign against the Iraqi KDP . #% If so , she should share the evidence with us , because there is no point in tabling an amendment like this without giving us that information . #% Meanwhile , the rapporteur wants to extend the scope of the framework directive to propose new legislation on workplace bullying and a new directive on workplace ergonomics , strengthen the display screen equipment directive and amend the manual handling directive . #% I conclude by emphasising that it is clear to the Commission that Vietnam would be best served by continued and more rapid progress in the country 's reform programme , so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and appreciates the value of accommodating dissent . #% We must learn from each other and we must learn to help Louise and the hundreds of thousands like her . #% Mr President , I warmly welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work , particularly in expressing so clearly Parliament 's understanding that trade is only a means to an end , and that end is sustainable development . #% I suggest to Mrs Jackson that if she is really doing her job as rapporteur , all she has to do is to ask for the Commissioner 's speaking note . #% I am sure it will be a huge success and we have put in place various ways of making sure it is successful . #% I support very much the DNDi call for more research in this area , and I hope colleagues will sign up to its campaign . #% The French people celebrating Bastille Day with fireworks tonight in the centre of this city have a right to expect that they are at not at preventable risk in the crowds of people who will also enjoy the celebrations . #% I understand we are talking about confirmation of Turkey ' s candidate status in Helsinki . #% The British Conservatives , like other centre-right parties across the European Union , are committed to properly-funded and high-quality public services and , if elected in June , to a massive increase in public spending of around GBP 62 billion on essential services like schools and hospitals . #% Answering that requires an audited statement of the reserves and an authoritative estimate of the liabilities . #% EPAs have an essential role to play as instruments for development and , appropriately designed , they represent an opportunity to revitalise ACP-EU trading relations , promote economic diversification and regional integration , and reduce poverty in ACP countries . #% We need more grassroots action like that , with European Union backing . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I want to report to Parliament that at the September part-session this Parliament passed a report on the Lloyd 's petitions , setting a deadline of 15 November for the Commission to provide information to Parliament about its regulation of Lloyd 's of London between 1978 and 2001 . #% It may not be a very popular move but I have seen very little evidence of the people who are making multi-millions of pounds out of football putting it back into football . #% I fear , given some of the misleading information in the original report , that party politics have more of a role to play than objectivity . #% But there is a rather important point being missed here : you have been the boss ; you have been the governor for the last five years . #% We should not let our very real concerns over democracy and human rights in Belarus prevent us from helping its children . #% Member States are responsible for determining the social requirements - such as death in service benefits - for their own pension funds and the tax reliefs that they give , consistent with subsidiarity . #% The interinstitutional agreement has been signed by the other institutions , and indeed already adopted as regards the internal provisions both by the Council and by the Commission , where it applies both to the politicians and to the staff alike . #% The decoupling system that you have put forward , Commissioner , will help us with the WTO round . #% Europe may lead in the textile fashion industry but we must have a basic manufacturing industry in order to support it . #% Why does it talk about capacity building but commit only 0.1 % of the current NIPs for trade support ? #% If we can build into the new eco-design legislation a requirement that cartridges must be refillable and recyclable , it will be a major step forward in both protecting the rights of the consumer and benefiting the environment . #% They need the information , the support and training to understand the risks they run if they take short cuts . #% I would also like to thank them for the quality of their contributions and the commitment they have shown in offering their opinions and submitting the report by Mrs Pack . #% This report is no doubt worthy , however we need strongly to reiterate the prime importance of respecting different national legal traditions rather than following too prescriptive a path . #% We have to recognise that the strength of the EU lies in its supranational institutions which complement and supplement national sovereignty and do not replace it . #% The EPP Group needs to examine its conscience and to do so rapidly because the position it has created in Parliament today is an embarrassment for all of us . #% 
They learn about things through television , and we have to see that Euronews manages to succeed . #% I want to see total implementation . #% That is a retrograde step . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , every time I ask Mr Barroso what his Plan B is , he says there is no need for one . #% Mr President , could I also add my congratulations to the Canadian Government who brought all this about ? #% It may at first seem a little peculiar to see who is voting on the one hand for the trade agreement while at the same time supporting the resolution on the issue of human rights in Pakistan . #% It will release assets for investment that are currently tied up unproductively in collateral . #% Apparently she was unable to answer that . #% This conflict meant agencies were keen to give high ratings to complex financial instruments , which led to investor complacency when buying these products . #% It is quite obvious that aviation ' s response to environmental concerns will have effects on competitiveness , some positive and some negative . #% Mr President , I wonder whether we can make a molehill out of this particular mountain . #% The overall cost of the Berlaymont meanwhile has gone up but , because of the contractual arrangements , our contribution to that cost is fixed , whereas the Belgian Government has an obligation to meet additional costs arising . #% Members have nothing of substance or detail before of them , nothing that they have the right to amend or that they all have the possibility to properly vote on . #% We have to fight for it across the Atlantic as well as within our Member States . #% Madam President , I would like to deal with two issues very quickly in the time that I have . #% Indeed , the broader question of finance for SMEs is vital . #% Mr President , if , on that basis the PPE will vote ` for ' , then I will accept it . #% The answer is that , as the fund is currently organised , the Commission can not do so . #% They must have a priority period of registration to avoid this problem of vexatious registration , of people who just want to make a `` quick buck '' moving into that field and taking hold of that registration . #% Then Ecofin tries to subvert the package on the financial system . #% There is no visible consequence of the vote on the executive . #% Also , as Mrs Pack has already said , there is the whole question of cultural diversity . #% We have to both sanction and protect these accession and aspirant states . #% There are a number of lessons to be drawn here . #% We welcome the emphasis on a civil project intended ultimately to be commercially viable in a number of fields such as communications and Earth observation , as well as position - finding . #% I would have liked to delete Article 25 , but I have conceded that it is not feasible or appropriate , and I have conceded the need for a pre-trade transparency requirement . #% The time has come to stop quibbling about lawyer confidentiality . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , as others have mentioned , Canada is indeed a solid trading partner for the EU . #% That too is a very important ingredient and there is no good reason for its delay until the end of this year or the beginning of next . #% We have worked together to ensure a consistent and complementary set of proposals is put to Parliament , and I should like to thank her very much for that . #% We have EUR 80 million allocated : EUR 30 million for 1998-99 and EUR 50 million for 2000-2002 . #% That comment removes some of the scare stories about the regulation . #% The overwhelming majority of people condemn factory farming and the battery system . #% Again all we had were a few worthy but irrelevant discussion papers . #% I hope that it will also bear in mind that the improvements in environmental performance that it wishes to bring about will be very fractional and may not justify the large amounts of cost and inconvenience for all concerned . #% Again , my friend , and I should like to say colleague , has produced two excellent reports on Dublin and Thessalonika . #% Between 20 % and 40 % of global industrial wood production is estimated to come from illegal sources , and up to 20 % of that finds its way into the EU . #% Yesterday , we gave rights to EU fleets to fish Moroccan waters and specifically rejected proposals that Member States could prohibit their fleets from fishing the waters of Western Sahara . #% However , we have a desperate shortage of skilled workers in the IT sector across the European Union . #% We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments . #% Mr President , just a follow-up question . #% Perhaps a generous financial package of compensation to those who lost property might be the final answer . #% In general , with certain reservations that I have outlined , we welcome the Commission 's commitment in this report to ensuring that access to asylum procedure is guaranteed . #% I should like just to press you on a couple of small points about what can actually be achieved , particularly given the slow process in the Council of Europe and the OECD . #% It is crucial , therefore , that we flag up the inadequacies that were inherent in the system and ensure that we go further in our aim to make better use of European taxpayers ' money . #% Children are being used by mothers from eastern and central Europe on the streets of our cities for begging . #% That is the only way to achieve democratic legitimacy . #% But we recognise that there are also things individual governments must achieve . #% Indeed , it is not only a human rights issue , but is a criminal law issue in the first instance . #% By increasing the funding for projects that support youth mobility and increasing the focus on the cooperation between business and education , young Europeans will have a better chance of career success . #% There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised , that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it . #% From what I have seen of the reform process , it looks good . #% I regret that Tampere does not address the issues with sufficient firmness . #% Is there a real risk that might happen , or can we stop it ? #% Two-thirds of visitors to the United Kingdom come from the EU , but these tourists will be put off by the fact that the pound sterling has appreciated by 19 % against the franc and the mark in the past twelve months . #% Maybe at this stage of the game we should keep these two balls in play and see how the game progresses towards second reading and possible conciliation . #% We therefore welcome the Sommer report and would like to thank the rapporteur for her work , which fully addresses these concerns , seeking compatibility rather than rigidly prescribing the type of technology , which should rightly be left to the market or , under the principle of subsidiarity , to Member States . #% We found the experience a profoundly depressing one , first of all because it was perfectly apparent that the referendum had not been organized in a particularly democratic way . #% In the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy there is a very good idea , although not one taken up in Mr Costa Neves ' report at the present time , that we should be seeking external advice on how to set priorities in foreign policy , so that we can begin to have some direction in the longer term as to how our money should be spent . #% But we must not get carried away . #% For these reasons , we have decided to abstain on the final vote . #% I am therefore a little alarmed to hear that apparently the Commission is intending to release EUR 1 million in aid to Zimbabwe for so-called ` parliamentary reform ' , administered , admittedly , through the United Nations Development Programme . #% We welcome the fact that the European Union has provided aid to that process , amounting to EUR 15 million to date . #% It is a disgrace that with this regulation the European Commission in the past has failed to address this problem . #% We thought it was essential that we and the Commission should recognize the importance of the Foundation for vocational training , not just to support the market economies of the emerging democracies but also to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights and equal opportunities and for those strands to be present throughout the PHARE and TACIS programmes . #% We also welcome the compromise amendment , which lowers the threshold for the registration of political parties from a third to a quarter , which is in the interest of both fairness and pluralism . #% 
Amendment No 28 reads at present : `` The Community shall each year set a global ceiling for funding action under this Regulation . '' #% And I hope that amendments along those lines will be accepted . #% Member States receive 10 % in a payment for collection of traditional own resources and they must , therefore , accept a high level of obligation with regard to this payment , particularly as it coincides with their own self-interest . #% This has been an excellent cross-party endeavour and on behalf of the ELDR Group I wholeheartedly support the result . #% I wish you every ounce of conviction and determination on this issue , but I will watch with interest to see the outcome . #% I agree with Mr Donner that this is perhaps more so from the American side than from the EU side . #% In another case a petition from a Spanish citizen , acting for an environmental association resulted in infringement proceedings being brought against the Spanish authorities in relation to the Habitats Directive , a frequent cause of complaint - the directive , not the authorities - with lasting national effect . #% The two rapporteurs , Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill , have striven manfully to try to get answers to that - I am not excluding Parliament here either . #% I am sure that Commissioner Reding will want to continue that important tradition , because there is much work to be done . #% We also need to deliver on better security as a whole . #% I thank the rapporteur for all the work he has done , but I should like to focus on one item on which I can not fully share his views , namely Amendment No 11 to Article 8 . #% Let us stop making a crisis out of a drama . #% In this Parliament we have to make every effort now , as the rapporteur has said , to make it possible for this money to move as speedily and as efficiently as it can to the people of South Africa . #% Trials are essential , but Iraqi judges can not carry the burden alone . #% I would like to thank Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Howitt for the work that they have put into this , which has been both a personal as well as a political commitment . #% The Tampere agenda had three elements : control , harmonisation and integration . #% I also wish every success to the November 2004 Nairobi Conference , which seeks to review the operation of this Convention and what further measures can be taken to implement its contents , in particular how to encourage armed , non-state actors to ban the use of antipersonnel landmines without recognising their legitimacy . #% I note that the Greek Presidency has identified cutting-edge technologies , in biotechnology and defence , as research priorities . #% Projections suggest on a worse-case scenario that the fund will be self-supporting for many years - I hope so . #% Tired workers are dangerous workers , whether they are operating on you or driving home . #% Our resolve should be made absolutely clear in the meeting scheduled to take place next week between the European Union and Zimbabwean representatives under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement . #% We therefore call on the King to restore democracy , call fresh elections and lift the restrictions on the media ; to call for a follow-up to the 2002 London International Conference ; to set out the principles to underpin a peace process in Nepal and to bring together King Gyanendra , the Maoist rebel groups and the main political parties . #% Listening to some of the talk , you would think the Second Coming of the Lord was being debated . #% Mr President , 14 November is World Diabetes Day . #% What we really need to do is empower women . #% I call on it to agree to the freezing of assets of terrorist organisations , because someone , somewhere , is banking bin Laden 's money . #% However , we see no reason for the EU to run up its flag on a naval operation . #% It seems that , for some , a centralised European economic ` government ' is indeed the ambition , but this would not address the problems we face : it would be bad for our citizens , for our Member States and , I say , for the European Union itself . #% Parliament and the advisory committees would also need to be involved in this monitoring process . #% I voted for Parliament 's recommendations on the Commission 's Single Market Act and I urge the European Commission to take up those recommendations to ensure that governance structures are strengthened , support for innovation and job creation is provided , and citizens are put at the heart of the Single Market . #% Similarly , I am unimpressed by the rantings of Socialists , like Mr Schulz , on refocusing priorities within the Lisbon process . #% A family from Coventry in the UK had to repatriate their son who was tragically killed on his first night on holiday in Spain . #% Also to the rapporteur , Mr Wijkman , for fighting for sufficient resources to meet the challenge with our full support from the Socialist Group and , of course , to those governments in developing countries that have been prepared to challenge taboos and to patient groups in those and other countries who set an example of the sort of change of attitude required , both of whom prove that the battle against HIV/AIDS can be won . #% The fact that they are new and different means that all too often they will not have the local contacts , the track record , the knowledge and especially the time it takes to come to terms with the rules that Europe lays down for access to its support . #% However , these elements also include health stewardship -- the range of functions carried out by governments as they seek to achieve health objectives , sustainable health financing , efficient and effective health service delivery and the application of health knowledge , technology and infrastructure . #% It is also fair to say that we have had very little involvement in the UK in the social dialogue . #% I am happy to be able to report that included the recommendations relating to the relationship between Commissioners , cabinets and services , which in September 1999 as one of the first acts of the Commission under Romano Prodi ' s leadership , became the subject to agreed rules which clarify those relationships . #% In the Horn of Africa , one hardly knows where to begin , because what we see is a lethal cocktail of conflict and poverty , where the rule of law barely exists , where there is no concept of democracy and human rights and where five out of seven of the countries of the region are in conflict with their neighbours . #% As has already been said , we should not underestimate the effect that harassment in all its forms has on people 's lives and health and the long-term mental and psychological problems we have heard about . #% The Declaration 1 runs counter to the modalities set out in Decision 87/373 , as it is the Commission which is assisted by the committee and not the chairman as is usual . #% That toxic chemical is slowly but surely accumulating in the human food chain , reaching levels which are already beyond World Health Organisation levels in certain fatty substances , typically butter , and in some cases fatty fish , such as salmon . #% Mr President , I think Commissioner Kyprianou has a difficult task in front of him in trying to persuade us that the November Council compromise is a genuinely positive step forward when it comes to live animal exports . #% SESAR will deliver what the archaic and fragmented current air traffic control technologies are incapable of . #% We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively . #% VW should be aware that we will be watching developments very closely in the months ahead . #% That money is necessary and we are very pleased that you agreed to it . #% Ignoring this entreaty from the people we are supposed to represent , this Parliament is seriously considering purchasing these buildings and making this bizarre arrangement permanent . #% For the public watching in on this - which increasingly they do - the Community method means that laws are proposed in secret by unelected bureaucrats - people like you , Mr Barroso . #% No one begrudges help to the people affected by the tsunami . #% As regards one or two comments on Article 3 and the scope of the regulation , if they are references to the issues about refugees and stateless people , then they are already included in the current regulation . #% Those people did what , arguably , we ask all good citizens to do : provide for their retirement , their future . #% Changes to rest requirements and driving times will severely reduce the ability of schools and coach companies to offer trips abroad at an economically viable rate . #% Mr President , I would like to explain why I did not support the amendments to paragraph 20 . #% I acknowledge that there is an issue over the Amendment 7 , which included research in the scope of the directive . #% Firstly , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , the draftspeople and the Commission - in particular Commissioner Diamantopoulou - on the directive and the report we have in front of us . #% And that is the goal of the financial services action plan . #% What concerns me is that the big airlines , backed up by their various alliances , will not be satisfied with one suspension but will demand others and , knowing the unhealthy , undemocratic influence that some of them have both in this and national parliaments , I believe today is a mere start of a process , sadly not the end . #% It can , of course , be squeezed through , but it can only be squeezed through if all Members of the European Council accept that they have a collective and individual responsibility to campaign for it to be brought into force . #% There is no doubt that by recommending Community health and safety legislation for the self-employed we have taken a giant step forward . #% I would ask the Commissioner to address that in his response tomorrow , because it is a time bomb waiting to go off . #% I would like you to tell me what specifically is being spent in that field , how , specifically , you are responding to President Mandela and the African countries who are asking for the EU 's help , and whether you will make this a real priority so that the EU is a proper contributing partner in kicking polio out of Africa by the WHO target date of the year 2000 . #% He has also wisely distanced himself from the restoration of the monarchy as an issue , leaving this to his people to decide . #% If it is , Commissioner , we need to know that , too , as soon as we can . #% There are some who claim that Parliament wishes to immerse itself in the detail of implementing measures . #% As a result of this pairing of good and bad proposals , we decided to abstain . #% But in the past the Turks have not had to contend with the European Union . #% 
What we have to say with regard to Europe is equally relevant to our policies for the developing world , but none of this is possible without adequate monitoring and enforcement or proper budgetary control . #% The Commission seeks to appoint the most suitable candidate for a post and , where there are equal merits relating to the relevant post , to give priority to the female candidate . #% Chinese Walls can be useful if they are enforced properly . #% We must give them some form of certainty . #% If the United States wants to be nominated to this new Council , it will have to allow unimpeded access to Guantánamo Bay . #% That is a sensible forecast to make , it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain . #% The assumption of at least Amendment No 1 - and to some extent Amendment No 30 - is that the substitution principle exists as a fully worked-out concept . #% Thirdly , unilateral action will undermine and discredit the United Nations organization because only a Security Council decision can legitimate action against any Member State . #% Agenda 2000 through the CAP must be an integral part of the support required for rural economies . #% I fear that Commissioner Mandelson 's review of the EU 's anti-dumping rules comes a year too late . #% The best sign of the success of ` one country , two systems ' has been that Hong Kong has been able , so far , to weather the Asian crisis , and to do so without interference from China , but with support from China . #% They certainly do not speak for Europe . #% It is important because five of the ten leading causes of disability are psychiatric , with the first of those , unipolar depression , accounting for some 10 % of life with disability . #% Madam President , the core of the Lisbon Strategy has to be jobs . #% Although the proposed level of funding is lower than the last two years , we must recognize that it represents an increase on the original amount subscribed prior to 1995 . #% Once we all realised what a serious disadvantage they would have , there was an agreement that such a proposal should no longer be included . #% Thank you , Commissioner , I am most grateful to you . #% This would be a much richer source of efficiency . #% We did not represent the EPP Group , we certainly did not wish to usurp the role of the official delegation . #% As you know , the next ministerial meeting between the EU and the ASEAN countries is due to take place in Europe . #% It is now time to go further and to establish the principle that all the legislative activity of the Council should be in public , as it already is for the other chamber of the EU 's legislature , the Parliament . #% We are told that the Commission intends to commission a study . #% What about the future ? #% All of this cruelly exposes the imperialism of the European project . #% We , along with other groups in this Parliament , are still waiting for the Commission to present a proposal laying down the practical arrangements for the implementation of the code of conduct that would facilitate cooperation and proper scrutiny . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Karim on the excellent and extensive report on the EU 's economic and trade relations with India . #% And yet here you are today telling us that the medicine the rest of us need is that we must have more Europe , we must have the Constitution , we must press ahead . #% It is on that basis that the citizens of the European Union will judge this process , not only on whether or not the Central Bank can maintain price stability but whether or not it can deliver investment-led growth and new jobs for our citizens . #% I would appreciate some clarification as to where we are at the moment on the extremely important proposal for which Commissioner Nielson was responsible . #% I should like to ask you to write , on behalf of this Parliament , to Mr Peter Caruana , the First Minister of Gibraltar , offering his citizens a warm welcome and congratulating them on their hard-fought campaign to secure their rightful democratic representation in Europe . #% I welcome the fact that the Commission has supported our representations on this , but the regulation still needs clarification . #% With the threat to us all from international terrorism and the continuing instability in the Middle East , it is vitally important that Turkey should remain firmly anchored within the alliance of the democracies . #% President , as a former British European Commissioner once said : ' I hesitate to intervene ' . #% We know that past governments did not treat these negotiations seriously , but the current government does and it is making major efforts to catch up , as Baroness Nicholson herself has admitted . #% We need to think how different Iraq could be . #% How will it function if it is going to be composed of nearly 30 members ? #% We have tried to strip away some of the duplication between what the employer has to do and what the state has to do in trying to treat a worker as a responsible adult . #% The competence of the Spanish judges to file the application was challenged by Spanish ministers . #% I want to focus on three specific areas : timetables , the criteria for Objective 2 and access to funds . #% We have received certain assurances from Mr Solana but we know , and our Italian colleagues in particular will remind us of this , that it will be difficult for those whose sons have died of leukaemia to accept that assurance unreservedly . #% That is a problem for democracies all over the world , and not least the United States of America , but it is a real problem for the EU as well . #% If there is monopoly power commercially , then the instruments are there to tackle it and they should be used . #% We therefore welcome this initiative as a means of at least trying to ensure the heavy goods vehicles are as safe as is possible and comply with Community legislation . #% As a British Member of this Parliament , I am very well aware of the position of the UK , the last Council Presidency . #% Sadly , there is no attempt in this report to tackle this serious issue , despite a reference to it in the introduction to the explanatory statement , wherein it is hinted that this is the main problem . #% We have made one or two small steps at the EU-US summit on this positive agenda , but there is one major element missing and that is the strategic view of the long-term destination of this transatlantic partnership on which we have no real ideas . #% Those who wish to force this Constitution upon the peoples of Europe should pause for thought . #% I want to draw attention particularly to paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution , and I shall quote from it , because it says that disabled people not only should be able to read web pages , but also should be enabled to manage the content of web pages . #% In rejecting Western consumerist values , Iran radicalised itself and supported radical Islamic groups in Lebanon , such as Hizbollah . #% We see the future for Iraq , and I call upon this House to support the report . #% I believe that the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee have done precisely that . #% Yet 1.1 billion people have no access to clean water and 2.4 billion are without hygienic sanitation . #% Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations . #% But , as it is , we seem to have to keep trying to invent new mechanisms all the time to actually deal with a process that is already there but is not obvious and is not transparent . #% It is important to stress the scale of the economic relationship currently worth USD 2 billion a day , but where there is competition there will inevitably be some areas of conflict and friction , and part of the nature of the relationship is to try and contain that friction . #% I was wondering for Commissioner Diamantopoulou whether this sets a precedent for other European employment legislation . #% Mr President , on behalf of everyone concerned about the unacceptably high level of coach and lorry accidents throughout Europe , I welcome the report by the Commission and , indeed , the work of the rapporteur . #% This must be an issue of great concern to the Commissioner . #% The bottom line is that the common agricultural policy must be radically overhauled and reformed . #% I would hope those savings would include changes in the way we do things , rather than just making cuts . #% Market forces are already moving in this direction . #% The first -- which , I am sure you will agree , was welcome , and perhaps overdue -- was the inclusion of a substantive chapter outlining the extensive work that the European Parliament has done in support of human rights and democratisation . #% I am sure that it will be the first of many . #% I think that , by getting this report together , it gives us the opportunity to plan to provide a fantastic product for people to come and see and enjoy during their leisure time . #% It is shameful that a government which six years ago was elected on a manifesto promising to end unjustifiable discrimination wherever it exists is ready to breach EU law to satisfy reactionary opinion . #% One other small point : much of this competition is between the European Union and the United States of America . #% 
We also , however , deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the European Union . #% Although the Labour Party has changed its mind six times on our membership of the EU since we joined 25 years ago , for the last few years it has been fairly consistent . #% I shall treasure my 10 years in this Parliament , and I shall watch with interest as the next Parliament takes on the projects that perhaps we have been able to start . #% Supposedly , Azerbaijan is committed to democracy , the rule of law and human rights . #% Reluctantly , I voted for this report . #% We consider this to be an alarming and unacceptable way of proceeding . #% I think that is an important principle and one we would all want to support . #% I also strongly congratulate Commissioner Vitorino for successfully brokering an agreement in his working group on the technical and semantic problems which have confronted some representatives of Member States . #% I know he has been very active in lobbying round Parliament for his proposal . #% In fact , it is estimated that nearly one million people have fled from their homes to escape the violence which is having such a devastating effect on all aspects of life in the country . #% The fact that the finalisation of the details has been held up by wrangling over intelligence sharing between NATO and the EU is said to be purely a technical issue . #% I would also very much like to back Mr Goebbels ' remarks about the importance of enlargement , namely that we should not have two standards - one for us and one for them . #% The EP should be specific when making resolutions . #% The proposal extends current EU directives on the handling of motor insurance claims to cover cases where a person visiting another Member State is the victim of an accident caused by a resident of that country . #% We are certainly not doing that . #% Mr President , if you ask our constituents what they want from Europe , they will probably tell us to do less . #% Mr President , if the political problems can not be resolved at long last , the issue of Cyprus has the potential to derail the entire enlargement process or to leave us in the ridiculous situation where hundreds of thousands of Turkish Cypriots are notionally EU citizens without having being consulted , while at the same time facing EU sanctions of a political and economic nature . #% After 30 years of meddling by the Commission and in-fighting by Member States , what we now have is a world-class ecological disaster and the near destruction of many parts of the British fishing industry . #% I would like to see the ECB follow a policy of openness and transparency similar to the Bank of England . #% I am sure that Parliament is pleased that the original proposal is now developed and that octaBDe has also been banned . #% We can not expect the Member States to fund cultural activities of a European dimension -- they will concentrate on the national dimension . #% There must be no more games from Milosevic . #% We are glad there is going to be an action programme coming forward in the spring and a Green Paper on emissions trading . #% There has been a lot of talk about football here today , but you mentioned sport and this is specifically a sports remit . #% I share the view of my colleague , Mr Rübig , that the role of standardisation bodies is crucial in making that market work better . #% The real cause of poverty is not having enough cash . #% For example , we are committed to a European target for biofuels and I very much support this , but the sustainable development strategy also includes a commitment to sustainable forest management and to halting the loss of biodiversity . #% Mr President , I do not agree with those speakers who said that the Commission as our negotiator did us wrong so far as the European Union was concerned . #% - I wholeheartedly endorse Mrs Gröner 's recommendation to approve the agreement reached with the Council on European youth action programmes . #% The idea is that we in the present Parliament should not do anything definitive , but should at least give an opinion how we think negotiations should proceed in the next Parliament . #% As the rapporteur has clearly said , the two worlds are distinguished because of the poverty which exists in the developing world . #% Most housewives do not know the difference between a heifer and a steer . #% Europe is a big market but it is not a dumping ground and Mrs Ferrer has made a very good case . #% Those of us interested in transparency in the European Parliament , and indeed those of us interested in justice in the wider world , are becoming more worried that the Commission seems to be willing to ride roughshod over natural justice in its bid for a judicial and public relations result against those it is pursing . #% However , this is not an argument about whether the EU is a good thing or a bad thing . #% The Soil Directive as proposed by the European Commission was flawed in many aspects and would only bring more regulation , more cost and less flexibility to British farmers , who we believe know better than European bureaucrats how to manage their own land . #% But best value can never be based on purely financial criteria . #% The key thing as others have said , is for us to stop perpetuating the image of people , like many of us in this Chamber , as a burden on society and its services , and to see us as much more of an asset . #% Madam President , like the previous two speakers I welcome this report and I praise the rapporteur for her work . #% Because this building is so badly designed , the lifts barely have enough capacity for Members as it is , without the security guards taking over two or three of them at precisely the time when everybody is coming down to vote . #% But given that there is a delay , which has already been deplored , I would hope that the period of that delay will be used constructively and that the Council and the Commission and indeed Parliament will reflect on how to get things as right as possible in what is clearly a key area . #% They make no mention of the need for good governance and the fact that corrupt governments in failed states are often the prime source of human rights abuse . #% However , these reports contain many instances detailing their total unsuitability to join according to the EU 's own membership criteria . #% This is a waste of resources and a waste of energy . #% This Parliament must continue to support this approach . #% Therefore , rather than open up a debate here , and given the technical nature of this report , I recommend that your services look at the report as it is tabled - which brings in Mr Perry 's explanatory statement , explicitly referred to in paragraph 5 - so that you can rule whether , as it currently stands , it is legally admissible . #% The Council really needs to start questioning whether Lisbon is working as well as people think it is in terms of the provision of high-quality jobs and the social cohesion which was sought at Lisbon . #% The US went around Eastern and South Eastern Europe penalising countries with loss of military aid if they refused to sign opt-outs from the International Criminal Court for US personnel . #% I very much hope we will support this figure of EUR 2.5 billion . #% Mr President , bad farming practice was the root cause of the foot and mouth outbreak . #% We should be looking at this and having the legal experts from the three institutions talking about the legal base . #% There are people in our Union who are not religious . #% Mr President , I rise under Rule 3 . #% The new law ushers in the use of a new bluetongue vaccine for the first time , which takes advantage of developments in science since the previous rules came into force . #% And I believe we have grasped that nettle today . #% More than that , transEuropean networks provide a proper basis for universal service for public services for all our citizens of Europe , making their lives better and building a better future . #% As others have said , stress is potentially the largest cause of time off work . #% This must be a first ! #% The allies must install a democratic government to prevent refugee flows or instability in the region , allowing the 200 000 in my constituency , London , to return and guarantee that Iraq 's oil wealth be used for its people and not for arms purchases . #% It is totally wrong for Member States now to blame the Commission when you were pointing out as long as a couple of years ago the problems that were going to occur . #% Can he not confirm that we could have fined the French football authorities something between FF 100m and FF 200m , which was something like 10 % of the extra profits they made ? #% Finally , it is important that we develop greater mutual understanding . #% I was delighted when an institutional administrative cooperation agreement was signed in June between the Commission , Parliament and the Council . #% However , as Mr Howitt has said , we have to criticize the arrangements Council is proposing for the implementation . #% Should the rest of us wring our hands and leave it to them ? #% We would like to know that you are out there selling it to the general public and that these reforms will be completed by the end of next year , as the most recent reform document from the Commission stated . #% 
We also want to record strong agreement for what Mrs Boudjenah puts forward in terms of the need to advance the impact assessments so that we can genuinely see the impact of these negotiations . #% However , alongside those fears are facts and the facts should put the fears into context . #% I want to stress to the Commission that the difficulties that we have had with them have been due to a mistaken loyalty to their predecessors . #% Here the attitude of the new Japanese government is crucial . #% Indeed , we should all welcome this enhancement and diversification of global energy . #% Mr President , on 27 February three people claiming to be members of the Brigade broke into the Medellín office of human rights lawyer Jesús María Valle Jaramillo . #% Firstly , we have to concentrate on how far priorities for development aid are still being determined within the Member States by historic , commercial and political interests . #% Over the next two or three days the European Parliament will be the only democratic body to be able to express opinions on the very important subject of economic and monetary union . #% We are now preparing for the seventh session of the JPA in Addis Ababa this weekend and I am sure that we will continue to work in an increasingly impressive and focused way in 2003 . #% We want to cooperate on energy matters that ensure respect for the principles of reciprocity and transparency and we want to encourage Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on transit . #% The multiplier effect of public investment has a crucial role in boosting growth and boosting employment . #% The issue that tends to be raised most with the Committee on Petitions is increasingly that of people who in their working lives exercise their right to move across and work in various countries in Europe and then retire elsewhere . #% Perhaps it might be better if my colleague , Commissioner de Silguy , answered the matter in writing . #% In the field of fiscal policy , there are some serious and sensible suggestions in Parliament 's amendments . #% Therefore , let us get on with the internal market . #% The poor Commissioner wanted a slim programme and has ended up with a fatty ! #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , I completely agree with all the other speakers that this is an excellent initiative and I am very pleased that the Committee on Culture and Education and Mrs Paliadeli are putting this forward . #% I wish to make sure in this great democracy that you give people time to get back into their seats to vote . #% The importance of this directive is that it will help us address that business climate , to have a cultural change so that we move away from late payment to prompt payment as the norm within the European single market and not , as it currently is , the other way around . #% The report calls for the elimination of forced labour as well as the abolition of child labour , and also highlights the need for more focus on the protection of workers ' rights . #% I hope we will get a clear commitment from the Commissioner this morning in this respect . #% This is an issue of great concern , provoked by the Erika and aggravated by the Ivoli Sun disaster off the Channel Islands . #% Mrs Lynne highlighted a couple of points that need to be re-emphasised , for instance , for a peace process to be successful , all parties have to be involved in it . #% The key question is : what is the remedy for this ? #% in writing . - Relations between the EU and Russia are clearly more than just about trade . #% What we must do tomorrow is support this piece of legislation because without it we do not go forward , we go backwards . #% I welcome the White Paper because it is a start in addressing the practical issues in relation to enlargement . #% Therefore the Commission should give particular attention to ways of tackling this unacceptable situation for women in Europe . #% Before I refer directly to the issues that are raised in the report , I think it is worth noting at this point that back in 1989 I wrote the Parliament 's first report on stage one of EMU . #% We know there has been a huge loss in elephant numbers , much of which is attributable to poaching . #% We are watching , listening and supporting . #% Mr President , I abstained on the resolution on Iran , and many of my British Conservative colleagues voted against , as Amendment l -- making a referral to the United Nations Security Council a requirement -- was rejected . #% What , indeed , will you say to those Asean countries , those neighbouring countries , who are rushing in to reinvest in Burma where Heineken , Carlsberg and others have pulled out ? #% In June 1998 , the Commission undertook to present a proposal on the future of the common organisation of the market in olive oil to the Council and Parliament in 2000 . #% We are faced with a difficult task , not only in regard to the definition which we have decided to offer , but also because so many countries have different attitudes as to what , for instance , is a child . #% My major concern is the short time between 2003 when the new standards will apply to new models and the date when that is extended to all new motorcycles . #% The real danger is not only the message the Farm Bill sends out to the poorer countries , but that it will also encourage those Members of the EU who are opposed to our own farm reform . #% We would like clarification as to why the Commission is not doing what Parliament requests and we certainly feel that there should be some reflection in the budgetary process if the Commission does not wish to do what Parliament has requested . #% We have to avoid the mistakes made last year which gave us the nonsense of one country closing its airspace whilst a neighbouring country kept theirs open , leading to chaos , confusion and huge economic consequences . #% My understanding is -- and I would like clarification on this because it was not clear from what the Council said -- that certain Member States want to use the peace facility , which is well worked out , to fund directly sub-regional organisations , apparently without consulting the African Union , or even seeking the endorsement of the African Union . #% They want yet more money . #% The real issue here is so much bigger . #% Prime among them is the stipulation that they should only be used for a limited period and for a very specific purpose , to ensure that no possible residues from such products could remain within meat or other products which eventually are sold for human consumption . #% I would say to those who voted against it and to the members of the PPE-DE Group that I hope they realise they have just voted against greater cooperation in matters of asylum in the European Union ; they have voted against sharing best practice in measures as we move towards a common asylum policy ; they have voted against looking at good ideas and sharing those ideas ... #% If you add to this the whole question of access and affordability on a global scale , you can see just how complex an area this is . #% The world has also witnessed unprecedented progress in science and knowledge and today we know how to address the great majority of the world 's disease burden . #% That compares favourably with the average bill for Member States calculated on a like-for-like basis of 13.1 % of budget . #% But there must be political will on the Russian side to eliminate the ` robber baron ' style of capitalism which has developed since 1991 . #% However , I find that I now face a wall of concrete , about which the Quaestors appear to know nothing . #% The cuts in the Community initiative go just too far . #% The clear conclusion is that the most important role of delegations is the administration of external assistance , not to try and run some additional diplomatic tasks . #% We are pleased that the Socrates Programme offers additional support for disabled participants , but point out that there is a long way to go before the extra costs of disability , the provision of specialist transport , personal assistance and sign language interpreters are provided for in all mainstream European programmes to make equal participation a reality . #% This is one of the key areas where the European Union has credibility . #% Is that really true because it is very hard to believe ? #% We have had a successful Bonn Conference and a Tokyo Donors Conference . #% In terms of the EU 's relationship with Tunisia itself , we wish to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and prosperity . #% I want to draw attention to just one other thing , namely the review of this directive , in which I hope this Parliament will be involved in future . #% The report with which we are concerned is , of course , retrospective to 1998 . #% However , we do not support the provisions in paragraph 52 concerning the establishment of a European Defence Minister , or the establishment of a European standing naval force . #% The best way that EU Member States could launch the constructive goal-orientated dialogue with the US -- which Mrs Plassnik called for and I agree we need -- would be to help this Parliament establish the truth about the extraordinary rendition programme and European complicity in it . #% - Madam President , I warmly welcome this report by my Socialist colleague Mark Watts , which will enable EU Member States to enforce international standards for ship safety , pollution , prevention and onboard living and working conditions . #% On her behalf , I want to begin by thanking Mrs Echerer on a number of scores . #% This Parliament should stand firm and put the environment and the well-being of Europe 's citizens before the narrow corporate interests of those chemical giants . #% Public investment has fallen over the last ten years from 3.5 % of GDP to 2.5 % . #% MEPs have been lobbied extensively by industry which , for the most part , wants less stringent restrictions on the use of VOCs than are proposed , and by environmentalists who argue the opposite case . #% Members will see from Article 8 concerning derogations on weekly working time and night work that we have insisted upon the promotion of social dialogue as the first option . #% 
Which way does the Commission think it should best work with this axis ? #% Mr President , Parliament faces a great strategic challenge to create a regulatory framework that will stop the spread of patentability of software . #% It is not acceptable that all aid has to be rooted through the Indonesian authorities , nor that NGOs are restricted to Banda Aceh . #% We have to think about how we are going to address the whole issue of considering and approving global technical regulations and the European Union ' s input into them . #% We know there are problems . #% To have a comment asking for our Administration to be politically balanced would not give the right signals to the outside world . #% The ECR Group has therefore voted against this report . #% Unless you learn to compete in Europe , you will not be able to compete globally . #% Mr President , I welcome the statements from the President-in-Office of the Council and from the Commissioner . #% The problems have deteriorated under the present British Government as it reduced the powers of our House of Commons . #% Nonetheless I have serious reservations about some of the detailed proposals in the Report , as well as considering it not to have a proper legal base . #% From that it will be clearly seen that most of the Member States have been doing positive things as far as developing their labour markets and their educational systems and reforms of all their other systems are concerned . #% The EU 's obsession with one-size-fits-all policy-making leads to the encouragement of quick-fix solutions from national governments . #% Tougher penalties must be dealt out to those participating in the sexual exploitation of children and offenders must not be allowed to get away scot free . #% We have one issue to settle : should we have a minimum unit for each exempted Eurobond of EUR 50 000 or of EUR 100 000 ? #% There has been a case of this nature in the UK , and there has also been a recent case in Italy . #% On noise reduction : at the Cape Working Group meetings over the past few weeks and months the EU has proposed phasing out Chapter 3 planes and upgrading Chapter 4 . #% Mr President , Prime Minister , sadly I have to decline the generous request for solidarity on the Constitution , but I am glad that we can now have a serious debate on the future of Europe . #% This is why this temporary committee was set up . #% In particular , for Parliament there is a huge challenge in realising the full legislative implications of completing a single market . #% Mr President , in the past Mr Blair has said that climate change is the biggest threat that we face . #% I am asking you in your presidency to make sure that those people in France and Holland are not treated with contempt . #% It also seems to me that WTO rules allow for differentiation between developing countries in non-reciprocal trade preference schemes , provided that such arrangements are based on objective criteria and that identical treatment is available to all similarly-situated developing countries . #% The regime recently snubbed a delegation of MEPs from this House from entering the occupied territory . #% I see no reference to this at all in the White Paper . #% I think we should all worry when the report informs us that the European Union must play a more active role in determining economic policy . #% It is entirely justified in this case that the blocking tactics be avoided by use of this rule . #% As a final remark , he would , however , reiterate the necessity of our open approach : the carrot rather than the stick , designed to encourage both the participation of , and leadership by , the business community . #% May I ask the Commissioner in what practical , tangible ways he will ensure that it is actually incorporated into Lomé ? #% This is unwise in my opinion , as I believe firmly that a prudent approach to public finance and borrowing is a good thing . #% I would like to give you this opportunity to let us know what you understood the protocol of that meeting to be , and perhaps also to clarify what you said to the press afterwards . #% Mr President , for my generation the outstanding politician in the post-war years has to be the American President Kennedy . #% We in the Budgets Committee especially through the work of Mrs Dührkop , who has worked in a very assiduous way have tried to seek an agreement on these reports . #% Not only will this be socially unjust to UK residents , but it will also make the UK less attractive to talented professionals , a point made by business interests . #% When you compare the record of aviation with the carnage that occurs on our roads , and when you consider that the number of air accidents is going down , whilst the number of road accidents is going up , then any discussion on aviation safety must take these facts into account . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Brok on his comprehensive report , and I agree with him that we have made enormous progress in terms of foreign and security policy . #% It is right and appropriate to use that clear and unambiguous language here as well . #% If you go on with this , you will breed the very intolerance and extremism that you say you want to stop . #% There is absolutely no evidence that zero tolerance is a serious , effective , or even practical policy to follow when we are trying to address this issue . #% It is prohibition which creates the profits of the drug barons . #% As I was about to make a speech on harassment at work during last night 's plenary session , the people in the booth behind me were smoking with the door open . #% Clearly , especially as regards small claims across international borders - in other words , between different legal systems - conventional court systems will be of limited real help , as Mrs Wallis has just pointed out . #% Although there is now rapid growth in venture capital funds in the European Union , there is enormous variation in performance . #% The other point is the question of Iraq . #% There are other problems in relation to irrecoverable VAT which , sadly , we can not solve with this report but are also very important . #% So , whilst welcoming the peace talks between President Pastrana and the FARC guerrillas , which began on that day , Thursday , 7 January , we have to condemn the fact that the paramilitaries are seeking to sabotage these peace talks . #% Could someone reduce the water pressure ? #% Double standards undermine our highest ethics and our aspirations for a world free from human rights abuses . #% Pakistan should now clearly demonstrate its willingness to take effective action against terrorists on its borders with Afghanistan and now , even more urgently , on its borders with India - in cooperation with the Indian security authorities - before there is another conflagration . #% It can not be , as Mr von Habsburg says , because this is regarded in Chile as international interference , when the main political parties and civil society have communicated to us in advance that they are supporting the terms of this resolution . #% From the UK 's perspective , here we are -- the fourth biggest economy in the world , the second largest global investor , a truly global trading nation -- and we are not allowed to make our own trade policy ! #% Many of those enterprises trade internationally and will have to deal with the euro as a foreign currency . #% The other important aspect of this proposal is that we need to encourage more professionals to set out their stall for mutual recognition and to accept a common platform proposal to work together to develop that . #% It almost warrants an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as one of the most belated welcomes in history , and I confidently expect in the future to hear in one of our resolutions that Mafeking has been relieved . #% As soon as it breaks out , that is when the dangers occur , and so one of the messages has to be that we need to look at the at-risk areas of our European Union to see where we should be highlighting the risk and monitoring it for the future . #% Secondly , it caused Europe , the USA and the West to look again at the whole question of international relations . #% We must send out an unequivocal message that such blatant abuses of fundamental human rights can not , must not , and will not be tolerated by the European Community . #% In the meantime , we ask the Council to introduce tough further measures targeted against the regime , its members and their interests . #% I should like to say that we do not have a lot of money , as he knows very well , for the programme : about ECU 11-12 million a year , spread over the 15 Member States is very small money . #% In the case of new clean air technology , it is usually the case that government must first lay the legislative egg from which is hatched the technology to give us cleaner cars or lorries . #% I therefore welcome the communication 's recognition that we need this comprehensive package of measures , including regulatory , economic , technological and operational instruments . #% When a 59 year old grandmother , a 30 years ' activist in the British Conservative Party is jailed for five years for laundering # 400 , 000 on behalf of the fugitive Azil Nadir , funder of that same ruling Conservative Party , we know that these criminals can be found in the most unlikely places . #% Secondly , Mr Schulz is quite right that we need to fill up the time . #% Mr President , I should like to add my congratulations to our colleague , David Hallam for the excellent report that he has produced , which actually sheds some clarity on what is a very , very complicated issue , namely the way in which the agri-monetary system works . #% Both the European Community and the European Investment Bank are shareholders in a bank that proposes to finance a project which will have exactly the opposite effect to protecting the environment . #% Firstly , there is the commitment to having genuine benchmarks , a genuine process of peer review , to the setting of targets , of genuine targets that we can achieve , to governments agreeing to embark upon what is quite a brave process of saying : ` yes , we will allow ourselves to be marked against each other , we will allow ourselves to be marked against the rest of the world ' . #% 
I must point out to her that the UK already meets the 70 % employment rate target . #% I very much hope that the Mediterranean programme and the enlargement process may be seen as complementary and not conflicting . #% I would urge just one thing of the Council and the Commission : the biggest problem the accession countries have is the ability of their civil service , their administrative systems and their legal systems to cope with the acquis communautaire . #% I will come straight to the point ; it is perhaps a reflection of our different views that I want some answers from the Commission about the way forward . #% It involves not just European-level measures but also very difficult issues about engagement with national law and regional law and , above all , as you indicated , the consumer has to be at the heart of it . #% There is political interference , things are going slowly , they are just not working and , at the moment , organised cross-border crime is being fought by policemen with personal connections . #% This is part of that transitional phase and it is encouraging that the Commission wants to tackle this seriously . #% Of course he killed others too . #% It is true that we have the same issues and I myself believe in pragmatic inactivity as being something we should not always be concerned about . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , my father is a small businessman . #% Democracy and good governance and our commitments to those two issues are also called into question by people in Burma and Nigeria who say that fine words will not , in themselves , assist their struggles . #% Its aims were to set up a mechanism for information exchange , to develop an EU-wide system for the detection , identification and diagnosis of chemical agents , to build up a stock of medicines and vaccinations , to establish a database of healthcare specialists and to provide guidance for health authorities on how to respond and how to liaise with international bodies . #% There are millions of ordinary , decent Muslim people , followers of the Islamic religion in the European Union , who are perfectly respectable and law-abiding and who were quite right to feel insulted by this report . #% Europe 's farmers must be given a clear direction for the future . #% No one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged , but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity . #% As we know , cosmetics , like chemicals , pesticides and medicines , have to go through rigorous tests before they can be placed on the market for human use . #% Earlier this year , in the very shadow of this building , I toured the local food markets with a food safety expert . #% Paragraph 17 on prescription will have a serious and negative impact on the process . #% Change is necessary for the Court . #% I particularly like the reference that we are a continent of liberty and , above all , of diversity . #% The rapporteur has already referred to the second point , which my Group would like to stress : the way in which the directive has ultimately succeeded in drawing the line at advertisements which mislead by the use of remarkably similar names . #% Mr President , for the benefit of the House , this is what would be called in English ' a wrecking amendment ' . #% I suspect Commissioner Patten will agree with that point . #% Surely the health and safety of lorry drivers requires a new regulation : to dig up all the cobble stoned streets of Brussels and replace them with concrete . #% Therefore , Commissioner , it is not an academic issue , but something that is very definitely an option for the ACP . #% Mr President , following on the discussion , would Mr Kinnock like to confirm to the House that career development based on performance and merit is going to be the foundation of the reforms that we approved in this House last year ? #% It has taken the Commission 10 months to carry out an impact assessment , without even warning Parliament that the issue might be on the agenda . #% Giorgos Katiforis outlined them well when he spoke of technical dialogue being used for the setting of impossible standards and of not being able to do anything about it because everything tended to be shrouded in secrecy . #% We want the Commission to move forward . #% Whilst all this is taking place , the Varroa mite continues its pernicious work and bees die . #% I want to be able to go back to my home city - which is a large port through which much of this adulterated meat comes in - and tell our local authorities that they can now expect legislation to back up their long-running pursuit of this deceitful and harmful trade . #% The fact is that despite a $ 1 trillion budget surplus over 10 years , President Clinton is not able to squeeze $ 210 million for HIPC out of Congress . #% The demands this Parliament frequently makes for respect of human rights is as important a part of the process as the demands for economic freedom . #% First , we have long called upon the Commission to do more with regard to greening the budget . #% The ACP is concerned about how co-management will be effective and about the role of the NAOs . #% Of course , we do not want a totally open door . #% Mr President , I am pleased that the Commission brought forward the consultation document . #% The Commission 's proposal requires stock farmers to register if they use such products . #% We must not forget that it was only the credible threat of military force which forced Milosevic to the negotiating table , and we must maintain that threat . #% Mr President , I will accept the House 's wisdom on behalf of my group , as I think it would be a long , drawn-out process to refer the report back to the legal services . #% I would commend to the House the amendment which has been supported by three groups : Amendments Nos 10 , 11 and 13 . #% If the Commission goes ahead with its notice concerning competition in the postal sector , it must be drastically amended from the published draft so as to be fully in line with the directive . #% Could we take account of that in what is being organized ? #% That is what Article 6 of our own EC Treaty obliges us to do - to integrate those policies . #% As is so often the case , Parliament and the European Union should leave things alone . #% It is important that patients such as those living near national borders , as well as residents of smaller Member States who suffer from rare diseases , are provided with financial support when seeking medical care elsewhere in the EU . #% In Britain the choice could not be clearer in our coming election : to guarantee a decentralised Europe that works , only the Conservatives offer an agenda which can get the post-Nice process right . #% Late on Sunday night a bilateral deal was struck between the US and China on China ' s accession to the WTO . #% However , the big problem facing the nation states of Europe is not too few diplomatic missions but too many unemployed . #% We are relying on the Commission to implement these proposals and to report regularly to Parliament . #% For my own group , our priority is to complete the single market , especially in the area of financial services . #% The fact is that the Napolitano report was not available in all the languages 24 hours before the debates and before the vote , as required by Rule 115 . #% As many of us are already aware , it already plays a key role in the transportation of goods throughout the European Union ; indeed 30 % or 40 % of our trade is already by short sea shipping . #% They may , in translation , be a rather more solid profession than lawyers are in my country . #% This means I can gladly vote for the report as amended by plenary . #% My question is : are depleted uranium weapons being used in Kosovo ? #% A British woman who moved from the UK in order to follow her husband in his work as a member of the armed forces discovered that she fell between two stools in terms of her entitlement to unemployment benefit . #% As the College of Commissioners made clear in our introduction to the White Paper , and elsewhere in that document , and I quote what we said : `` the challenges of globalisation and future enlargement require better governance at all levels including the European Union '' . #% Could the Commissioner inform Parliament as to the exact circumstances in which Paul van Buitenen now finds himself ? #% This is such a good report because of the cross-party cooperation , similar to the cross-party cooperation there was on the article concerning anti-discrimination , and because of the input from the disabled people 's organisations themselves . #% It conducts business like the Supreme Soviet and the debates here are not debates in any real sense of the word at all . #% It is not decided here , it is actually decided out there in the Member States . #% British growth and productivity rates have proven that fears about opening EU labour markets are unfounded . #% We have the jurisprudence of the ECJ , now defining and redefining what was originally agreed on access to documents . #% However , looking at the technological points that the rapporteur makes , it is not just in the longer term that we should be looking for savings , but also in the short term , when we should be able to come up with cost-cutting measures . #% I hope we can rely on you to prioritise civil liberties and human rights in the future . #% 
If he does not know , I can tell him that there are no caged beds in any existing Member State . #% I do not think that the committee will change its mind , for technical and political reasons . #% It has to deal with Mr Chirac who wants to ring-fence all agricultural spending , from which his country benefits far more than most . #% PVC has received a lot of attention and despite the fact that it has been around for over 40 years with no apparent health risks , the spectre of the risk of PVC has been raised . #% It knows that the European Parliament is right behind it . #% He seems to imply that this is a matter for the Presidency-in-Office and not for fourteen sets of bilateral relations . #% I am glad of the opportunity to place on record the deep resentment of my constituents in the East Midlands at the attempts by Brussels -- aided , let it be said , by a supine British Government -- to divide England by imposing artificial regions . #% We are a Union of diverse religions , of religious pluralism . #% Secondly , Commissioner , my Labour Welsh colleague and I wrote to you last week inviting you to come to Wales to see first-hand what the problems are , what needs to be done and also to have an opportunity to meet some of the key people in the National Assembly and other areas . #% I also welcome what Commissioner Borg has said along these lines , and I particularly echo what has been said about the inaction of Member State governments in the European Union . #% Although today it is only seven minutes over , we had no previous business to delay us ! #% If you are taking money from Category 1 for the next two years , where do you expect that money to come from in 2003 ? #% It is a time not to look back in anger but to look forward with hope . #% The summit is also important because it brings together members of the Council of Baltic Sea States and two of the three leading institutions of the EU : the Council and the Commission . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I am speaking this evening on behalf of the shadow rapporteur for my group , Mrs McClarkin , who has also been much engaged in following this dossier . #% The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls . #% It is always in the same kind of vein . #% If they are not covered , and an airline goes bankrupt , they will be put in a dire situation . #% But nevertheless , from the point of view of the operation of the Single Market , which is also of overriding interest to us , the situation is , as you suggested , deeply unsatisfactory . #% I am sure I can speak on behalf of the whole House when I say how much we have valued his participation , not only in the meetings here in the Chamber , but also in Parliament 's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and of course the informal meetings we have had over the last few months . #% In line with many of the points highlighted in the report , Mrs Scallon heard that there was concern regarding the lower standard of EU training and the possible danger to public safety that might be caused by language difficulties with multilingual crews , where no translation was available . #% I welcome that , and strongly urge you to do it as soon as possible , and in particular to introduce a maximum eight-hour journey time for both slaughter and further fattening animals . #% I would like to see us -- perhaps with assistance from Member States and the Commission -- develop a proper electronic parliament focusing on these issues , so that when we go to Tunis -- and I hope that more colleagues will join us for that -- we will be able to engage in the political debate . #% I do not trust the Commission to provide unbiased information . #% Mr President , the nation states can and do make their own arrangements on data protection . #% There were a number of innovations in 2005 . #% The internal market has been one of the biggest successes of the European Union . #% This is an issue which has been regularly debated in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and which has consistently received the support of our ACP parliamentary colleagues . #% In fact , seen from the perspective of employment and social policy and against the long procession of summits which preceded it , Lisbon stands out along with Luxembourg in terms of the potential it offers us . #% In response to that , a petition was brought to this Parliament by Mr James Fielding from my constituency and others . #% Recently the US State Department decided to keep the country on the ` country of particular concern ' list , as Vietnam started a campaign against religious communities this summer . #% I very much hope that more members of the EPP/ED Group will support this report . #% So the Sovietisation of the EU continues . #% Under the compromise , the directive will apply to such accidents in a certain number of countries outside the European Union . #% I do not want ratings that are ` convenient ' , whether that be ` convenient ' for investment banks or ` convenient ' for central banks . #% We believe that basing this directive on Article 175 alone would run the risk of distorting the market , because individual countries could strengthen the prohibitions contained in it . #% It is clearly our duty to ensure that the standards by which they are governed or regulated attain the best levels of corporate governance . #% When we look at this year 's Kellett-Bowman report on the discharge , we see that for Dublin there was an underspend of ECU 140 000 ; for Thessaloniki an underspend of ECU 1.28 million . #% Those who question it need to ask themselves whether they would be satisfied with criminals spending years beyond the reach of the courts and beyond the reach of justice , because traditional extradition takes too long and has too much red tape . #% If we ban existing products , alternative products may be even more dangerous . #% I do , however , wish to publicly acknowledge the progress that has been made in improving the financial management standards by this past Commission . #% They can not find their connections unless they know them personally . #% Finally , just as Parliament voted earlier today in favour of a UN Convention on disability , it is right that the abuse of the human rights of people with disabilities are represented within this comprehensive resolution . #% Certainly we must not let capital get away with simply exporting the dangers and disasters which we know beset this minefield in this particular Continent . #% As regards the Commission President and the vote on the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole , Mr Rothley has raised a valid point . #% However , my Group and many others will vote against it in order to support Amendments Nos 100 and 101 , which will achieve almost exactly the same effect with the slight improvements . #% Our job is to make the best deal that science allows . #% This case raises serious issues of what happens when Parliament upholds the Ombudsman 's view on a case , this one relating to data protection and access to information , and the Commission does not agree . #% When will Parliament adopt its own security rules ? #% I believe that is what the people of Europe have said , particularly in France and the Netherlands . #% Deliver , do not talk ! #% What inevitably happens is that people who sell cars vary the prices to take account of registration tax in various Member States . #% The most disappointing aspect of the Council was , however , the fundamental failure of leaders to speak forcefully on the rising tide of protectionism . #% This has been questioned and resisted before . #% Recently my country , the United Kingdom , has been subject to an enormous rise in the inward flow of peoples and in my previous job as a Central London hospital doctor I witnessed a significant degree of illegal immigration and fraudulent abuse of our generous asylum policy . #% The limit values agreed for Euro 5 and Euro 6 steps are challenging but achievable standards . #% I would submit to you , and through you , to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities , that only one way is necessary . #% I certainly note the Commissioner 's words very carefully , namely that this system is not fair and has been discriminatory . #% I look forward to the meeting to be held shortly with the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control to see what we can do to assist each other in this joint exercise . #% Furthermore , the decision to maintain in place the existing Chinese civil servants in Hong Kong is an important vote of confidence in the area , particularly given the high quality of the individuals concerned . #% The directive is the result of agreement between the democratically elected European Parliament and the overwhelming majority of democratically elected Member State governments in the European Council of Ministers . #% In the UK the previous Tory government cast a great deal of doubt on whether or not the euro would actually happen . #% In the case of Gibraltar , a particular complex of geographical and political isolation has been caused by the attitude of the Spanish authorities . #% At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening . #% This is not all doom and gloom . #% Article 13 provides for appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex , racial and ethnic origin , religion , belief , disability , age and sexual orientation . #% 
People on European soil have the right to live free from violence ; they have the right to live in peace ; and that , I believe , is unequivocal . #% Another huge waste . #% Many Member States , including some like Germany who proclaim themselves in favour of more political integration , are against foreigners taking over their own companies . #% There is a lot still to do . #% It also made an excellent British delicacy called pork scratchings - which I just toss in so as to keep the interpreters on their toes . #% Over 200 people have been killed there and their homes and those of others have been destroyed . #% Now is not the time to make that choice . #% Having created an unnecessary and artificial military divide , the EU and NATO have had to spend two years on negotiating and arrangements to enable the European Union and NATO to find a way of working together . #% Albania is , after all , a secular country in practice . #% The Socialist Group will defend the independence of that bank wholeheartedly . #% This sort of democratic odyssey is trying to establish one thing : the appetite of the peoples of the Arab countries for democracy , the rule of law , civil society and so on . #% Mr President , it is quite clear from discussions that everyone wants to finish in December . #% Seeing the misery and distress of him and his family was probably my first experience of the consequences of oppression for the lives and future of ordinary people . #% One penny in the pound is acceptable , one cent in the euro , but no more . #% Do prepare and activate our humanitarian and subsequent development aid ? #% Parliament should not raise hopes that the EU will not want to fulfil . #% Amendment 25 , until it was sensibly withdrawn , ordered the flying of the EU flag at Champions League and European Championship matches . #% Because of that we are able tonight to celebrate a historic victory for the European institutions in the field of maritime safety . #% As an inclusion to the main body of text , the annexes are extremely important when we come to adopt and review this regulation in future . #% She spoke very passionately and rightly , I believe , about the importance of defending small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe . #% The Commission has built constructively on its Green Paper , but if there is one obvious area where it might usefully make some further vigorous progress , it is in the area of handling complaints . #% I am waiting with interest to hear from the Commissioner whether she has been keeping cards close to her chest or whether her public position remains the same . #% I said at the beginning of the process in 2001 that this proposal should be rejected and sent back to the Commission . #% This is also important in order to protect the rights of individuals . #% All the tests we did , in testing that was widely and commercially available , showed even such maize occasionally contained between 1 and 2 % adventitious GM material . #% Just because they use it in the American regulatory system , that does not mean we should adopt it here . #% Let us take on the anti-Europeans . #% It is a pity that Mr Goodwill did not read our amendments more carefully . #% We heard from Mr Barnier and Mr Grech today , and we made a contribution with Mr Monti 's report . #% After Lisbon , the true Holy Roman Emperor of the 21st century - the Charlemagne of our times - whose writ extends farther than that emperor 's ever did , is , of course , the President of the Commission , our very own Senhor Barroso . #% Worse still , it is a very dangerous thing to do because when people realise that voting in general elections can change nothing - because the power has been given away - what are they left with ? #% We should also be careful to give proper attention to the cost/benefit analysis because some quite large sums of money are involved -- the cost to my country would be EUR 8.8 billion , albeit over 25 years . #% Mr President , having had experience with many of my constituents of the various water directives currently in force in the European Union , one of the clear things that emerges is how difficult they are to understand and how difficult it is for normal citizens that are concerned about their estuary or the condition of the water in their rivers to point to the area in which the European Union 's directive should be able to help them . #% Colleagues may be surprised to know that those four chairs were allocated to Members of this Parliament . #% In looking at the Baltic states , for example , I do not accept the argument that we are looking at three peas in a pod . #% I want to point out that there is a difference between a social conscience and a socialist conscience . #% How can we not continue the support of this levy and the job creation schemes in the ECSC report when we are supporting a job creation package elsewhere in our budget ? #% In spite of this , some 218 tonnes of food got through to Kabul last week to avert a crisis . #% When we were coming to these conclusions , all three institutions were of a mind that the deal on the legal basis would be fine for the future , but we still have the problem of this year 1998 . #% Violence against property and people must cease and the hostages released . #% Despite attempts by many Eurosceptic UKIP colleagues to demonise this report , I will be voting for it on the basis that the attempt by the Commission and rapproteur to extend its remit to include inland waterways is rejected . #% I have to thank Commissioner Kallas in particular for the way he has encouraged Parliament by persuading the Commission to take on board those recommendations and to produce the roadmap towards getting a positive statement of assurance . #% I commend it , and I hope the Commissioner will give it speedy effect . #% As there are so few people here and whilst very few people are concerned about the debate , I shall concentrate on two points on which I will speak in a personal capacity . #% Mr President , I very much welcome what the Commissioner has said , for three reasons . #% I should like to mention here that on the order paper it looks as if I had taken out some of the recital 11 . #% Brazil and the United States have competitive advantages - lower land values and certainly a better climate . #% It is something we can help with , but we must not be deluded into thinking that it is a power of ours . #% You have big problems and many of them are of your own design . #% It now seems that although we think we are close to agreement , we are actually a long way from agreement and there is a very real prospect that we could lose everything . #% He knew that this project was a project of Parliament . #% There is little doubt that the virulence of the virus and the extensive sheep movements just before the outbreak have been important factors in the spread of the disease . #% Nevertheless , I ask him to look very carefully at the organisations who have been doing the surveillance -- particularly on tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS -- and see how they can be supported over the coming two years . #% Before I come back to the presidency , I should just like to deal with one or two remarks made by Mr Cook in his speech . #% I know that this has been given some prominence in the Presidency 's programme , but I must speak about one issue which is mentioned , but without enough emphasis in my view . #% With that one caveat I heartily commend the directive and all those who have worked on it and indeed those who will benefit from it . #% I can only think of one plausible explanation : perhaps Chancellor Schüssel is unhappy in his job and is hoping that the Austrian people will vote him out of office ! #% Coming two weeks after Parliament approved the atypical workers directive , where extra costs and red tape could mean the loss of 160 000 temporary worker jobs in the UK alone , this latest directive shows that the EU continues to operate in a time warp when it comes to employment and social legislation . #% Cooperation is continuing to take place between the British Government and the relevant authorities in the Commission and throughout the Union , to ensure that the outbreak is controlled , contained and eradicated as soon as possible . #% Many of the victims of the past few days were badly tortured before they were killed and most of the paramilitary attacks were in the north of the country . #% In the last action plan that was put forward , there was a core element missing throughout , and there was much press debate about the fact that Middle Eastern leaders are still able to take money from their populations and bring it into Europe , and we are doing nothing to prevent that from happening in the future . #% I hope time can be made for this . #% This may , indeed , have been Mr Radwan 's intention -- I do not know -- but the amendment refers to a resolution adopted by Parliament , which envisages the adoption of sunset clauses on the delegation of legislation that apply systematically to all legislation that we adopt in the financial services sector . #% The UK has shown how free labour markets , coupled with proper social protection , can boost a prosperous economy . #% We have not finished the reform . #% However , they appear to have dangerous effects on the environment and public health and , therefore , we felt something had to be done . #% 
Not least there is the problem of trafficking in adulterated butter using vegetable and animal fats and even chemical substances , leading to an estimated loss to the EU budget of some EUR 45 million . #% This undertaking is being discriminated against by the German VAT authorities . #% Mr President , while there are certainly elements worthy of praise in the Green Paper , overall we are left with the impression of a lost political opportunity . #% Half a million Zimbabweans are now on the verge of starvation . #% Looking back historically , we are doing a better job every year and this is certainly due partly to the work done by the rapporteurs . #% I believe that the Arabs deserve democracy . #% Mr President , I would also like to add my thanks to Mrs Smet in particular for doing an excellent job of work on the working time directive and also , of course , to Mr Rocard and to you , yourself . #% Yes , he is very happy to go ! #% I have a grave concern that this legislation will put small businesses like my father 's out of business for ever , because we are told that this legislation will , in fact , put up to EUR 5 000 on the price of vans . #% Mr President , like Mr Ford , I should like to congratulate Mr Dell ` Alba on an excellent report . #% I can only welcome the resolution 's demand that Roxana Saberi should be released immediately on the grounds that the trial was held in camera without due legal process and there was a complete failure to comply with international norms . #% In that case the Commission does indeed have an interest , but I would merely suggest to you that the Commission has no business or interest in how one company wishes to adjust output to demand . #% I share with Mrs Theorin the hope that we can use all our resources - specifically military resources of satellite intelligence , etc. to start to attack environmental security . #% The European economy is based heavily on the construction sector , which accounts for 10 % of EU GDP and directly employs 12 million EU citizens . #% The tax has the support of 47 % of the people in the UK , according to a recent survey by War on Want . #% She has produced a very good report and I know that she has worked very hard on TSE and BSE for many years on behalf of this Parliament . #% I would , for example , express my own concerns in both respects over the second indent of the paragraph and any proposals for providing a tax and legislative framework for the development of the social economy , the third sector . #% Mr President , the common position for adopting the Parliament and Council decision on the Europass seems eminently sensible , and one wonders why it took so long to achieve it following the completion of the single market 12 years ago . #% The Commission has already established the hot-line . #% We back down over taking decisions which will be unpopular in the short term with our electorates . #% We now know , for instance , that the EU has lost some EUR 600 billion over the years , which far exceeds the UK 's net contribution of GBP 75 billion since we joined . #% I should like to respond to the honourable Member , very briefly , by saying that I strongly commend those companies , notably Swedish companies , which have made attempts over the years to develop their own direct links in order to shift freight from road to rail . #% Opinion polls in the European Union at the moment show that people are either indifferent or hostile towards enlargement , so we must actually sell this project , both within the European Union and in the applicant states . #% My group will not be supporting the amendments which oppose this directive , but will generally support the rapporteur . #% In practical terms Amendment No 82 is acceptable , but not Amendment No 9 . #% Therefore the way in which we deal with this issue politically is of vital importance . #% In my experience it is the existing buildings that are the key to our success . #% ` Inappropriate ' to give a UK view ? #% Why not appoint one Commissioner responsible for ICT policy in general but , above all , for general coordination between the different directorates-general ? #% Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner . #% This is a pattern which is common across the EU and one that we must be determined to change . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the ALDE Group firmly and consistently supports the goal of EU accession for all the Western Balkan countries . #% I hope that when it comes to the next interinstitutional agreement we will have learnt lessons from this one , especially in category 4 . #% This is not clear at present . #% What it does is stop the excessive cabin baggage which has led to passengers being injured from luggage falling out of overhead bins ; to passengers having restricted access in case of emergency evacuation procedures and , which I know from my own experience , to aircraft toilets being used to carry bags . #% Although VAT is sometimes complex , its effects across borders may cause specific problems which this report helps to identify and clear up . #% It is factually incorrect in relation to its references to the legality of the culls , suggested breaches of animal welfare legislation , suggested breaches of environmental legislation and lapses in bio-security . #% If we are to have long-term sustainability and develop a truly green economy , we have to take care to foster environmental-friendly businesses and use resources efficiently , and that includes the way in which we use our workforces . #% We should be proud of the democracy that exists at the heart of this Union . #% The shift of the burden of proof , as called for by this draft directive , is both frightening and extreme . #% On the first occasion I carried a letter from President Klaus Hänsch informing Aung San Suu Kyi of the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to her . #% I believe that we have reached one of those critical stages in the development of the transatlantic relationship in its global context . #% Threats of violence against supporters of the MDC have continued after the elections . #% This does not mean cutting corners since cases decided sloppily or unfairly risk taking longer in the end because of appeals . #% We need a statutory right to interest . #% One of the problems we had with Kosovo was not just coordination within the Commission but also coordination among the Member States of the actions they took as individual governments . #% Another company , Beaver 84 Ltd , of Basildon was not even told by its intermediary that its application for a financial lease was even on the list for a European subsidy . #% The rule change also would guarantee that associated committees are represented in any Parliament delegation in a conciliation procedure . #% Secondly , we want to see the associated issue of drugs being examined by an EU research programme to make sure people can not take drugs , drive and contribute to accidents as they do , on an increasing scale . #% It was the perfect time to seize the high ground and it failed to do so . #% It is clear that there was an essential integrity to this election that was lacking in the earlier one . #% We want to see a stronger commitment by national governments to real and enduring economic reform . #% Certainly not if you look at what we spend on it . #% British Conservatives support the objectives behind the Sustainable Development Strategy but believe that this resolution is unduly negative as to the progress that is being made . #% There are certainly many projects mentioned which are worthy of further exploration : the European credit transfer system , for instance . #% It is important to restate that this is not about the data within the calls or on the internet ; it is about traffic data , and it is arguably to allow us to protect fundamental freedoms . #% In conclusion , may I say that the Commission has apparently already written the draft report for the year 2000 . #% Another pressing issue is the fact that an increasing number of younger women are developing breast cancer - 47 % under 55 years of age . #% It recognises the concerns of people in Britain and Europe about the transportation of nuclear material and takes huge trouble in testing what needs to be done . #% My group particularly welcomes the fact that this meeting looks set to agree an air ticket levy with proceeds going to benefit some of the world 's poorest people . #% Why not Denmark and others ? #% We must not go there making demands , we must go there in order to try to have some results . #% I call on you , Mr President , to write to the authorities in Auchy-les-Mines to express our strongest condemnation of the desecration of the graves of these soldiers -- men who gave their lives selflessly to preserve our freedom and democracy in this continent . #% It is right for the EU to base cooperation on the concept of executing the decision of the issuing State , rather than that of deciding whether or not to grant cooperation in response to a request . #% . The illegal trade in human kidneys has become a multi-million-euro industry , with European patients whose lives are at risk desperately trying to find donors on the Internet . #% Would he agree with me that it is vital to have an interinstitutional arrangement for independent impact assessment so that when proposals come through this House and colleagues add burdens on business they are properly costed ? #% 
This is something that we need to be mindful of . #% I remember that we sat together on Article 13 hearings all that time ago . #% We will try to get the best deal for those who have Equitable Life policies . #% At the moment , 80 % of public websites are not accessible and we must ensure all documents are in accessible formats , particularly Commission and EU documents . #% By the proposal 's own admission , litigation in this new court will be two to three times more costly than litigation in national patent courts , which this proposal will also abolish , thus putting appeal to this court beyond the reach of all but large corporations . #% By voting through this amendment now as part of Amendment No 188 , Parliament would make clear that such Member States could not expect the benefits of hosting such new agencies if they are not prepared to exercise their responsibilities . #% We ask President Gaddafi to release them now . #% Gaza is an Israeli prison camp ! #% In the meantime consumers must be given the information to make their own choices and , if this ultimately slows the development of this technology while more research is undertaken , then that may be no bad thing . #% That also needs to be tightened . #% Can we ask the Member States to insist that nobody goes into higher education , unless they have a qualification in a modern language other than their own ? #% Mr President , it seems to me that this joint debate tonight is perhaps a fitting finale to the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in this mandate . #% in writing . - Whilst we support measures to manage and protect European forests , we do not support the creation of a new European forestry policy that would transfer powers in this area to the European Union . #% We must send a message to the British Government that they should reverse their appalling decision of the last few weeks to allow secondary students in Britain not to learn any foreign language at all . #% I have to admit that representing London I do not have too many fishermen in my constituency and I am delighted to be able to put forward a few comments on behalf of Mrs Scallon who , unfortunately , can not be here today as she has a pressing engagement . #% We are , at this moment , at this very late hour , trying to decide the strengths and weaknesses of the directive . #% If the term ` constitution ' proves unpopular and unacceptable , it is given a fresh wrapping so that past rejections can be ignored . #% Over the horizon , we look forward to Romanian and Bulgarian accession in 2007 . #% Perhaps I could be allowed a special reason for celebrating these conventions , as one of my family members founded the British Red Cross movement . #% She has been a tireless campaigner for MS sufferers and I commend her courage and her hard work . #% If you just add some 5 % per year for six years , that would mean EUR 83 million . #% The EU has to be based on a system of rules and laws . #% This is vital for the credibility of any president of Pakistan , or any government or , indeed , any government anywhere . #% The Iraqi soldiers had broken every single bone in that man ' s body . #% This misconceived objective explains why a separate institute is in fact a bad idea . #% On election , Mr Erbakan 's first visits were not to the European Union or to the United States , traditional colleagues and friends of Turkey , but to countries far away , countries of an Islamic tradition understandably , but none of them were democracies . #% I should add that I asked the Commission back in August about a particular comment in the report , which stated that in August there would be some feedback from SMEs about their response to the project . #% If the Commission was honest it would agree that the original proposal it presented to this House had many problems , particularly related to the retrospective element of the proposals . #% I prefer to use the name Burma rather than Myanmar since the people of Burma and now Aung San Suu Kyi , the legitimate leader in Burma , do not refer to it as Myanmar . #% It was also argued that abuses of the provision should be prevented by proper controls and that such a change , if to be made at all , would be more properly done in the reform of the CFP as a whole . #% As Mr Byrne pointed out to us in an admirably clear intervention , there is no treaty base for it . #% Many of us go to Strasbourg under protest in the first place , and the fact that it can not even be ensured that we can get there and back properly is a matter of grave concern . #% It has proposed a new five-year transitional period from 1996 for each product not yet registered , starting from the date of application , instead of from the date originally agreed . #% This is a legally uncertain basis for legislation and that makes me unhappy . #% Can I take this opportunity to welcome the programme in the context of the five-year strategic plan . #% The Commission listens to such views and gives them proper courteous consideration . #% We respect its culture , its background , its history , its religion . #% However , I have been favourably impressed by your presentational and communication skills and your clear attachment to a successful Europe and a strong European Commission . #% My second point is that we must keep this under constant review . #% The issue of health care and care for the elderly is an important one and of concern to us all . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur as well and to ask how far we can trust the Council . #% We need a legally binding code of conduct so that we can move forward in this very important area . #% 1998 discharge , budgetary control #% But Iraq should know that if it does not allow UNSCOM to continue its vital work , the real threat of military action will remain . #% Mr President , Commissioner , as you heard from our Group chairman earlier in the debate , the EPP visited Berlin last week . #% Mr President , the Treaty of Amsterdam contains among its innovations the fact that Parliament would henceforth elect the President of the Commission on a proposal from the national governments , just as Maastricht already provided that the college of Commissioners would be subject to a vote of confidence by the European Parliament . #% I want to bring a delegation from the construction equipment manufacturers to see him as soon as possible to address their issues as well . #% UNRWA is facing a severe cash shortfall and we , as donors , have to do our utmost to accelerate the procedure to help out UNRWA and ultimately the Palestinian people . #% We must speak as the European Union with one voice in our relations to China . #% We need the international police task force and indeed the stabilization force to be more vigorous in keeping the communities apart ; to stop the cowardly attacks which we have seen recently in Mostar ; to investigate them and to take action against the guilty parties . #% For those of us who have to explain back home how this Parliament influences legislation , the timetable and content of the general product safety directive could be something of a model . #% I hope that the advisory committee and other mechanisms proposed will satisfy this condition but it is a matter that will need regular review . #% I wish to put forward a proposal that might relieve pressure on the end of today 's agenda , namely , the debate previewed for the late payments directive - the report of the conciliation procedure with the Council . #% Furthermore , the ECR Group believes that the issues of sexual and reproductive choice and health rights are an issue of conscience for each individual Member and Member State to decide . #% Let us be very clear about the damage that this law , if adopted , would inflict on ports , including the east coast ports which I represent in this Parliament . #% A Member State , under the provisions of the Treaty , has sounded out its people on the conclusion of Treaty changes . #% It is not so today . #% Would he emphasise the need to enact the envisaged legislation , enabling charities to have proper contracts with the government and allowing them to have financial support ? #% That has to be within proper cost constraints but again , as has already been said , at present we are spending just 25 cents per annum - for English ears , that is 15 pence per citizen per year . #% Other than that , the principles in the report are fine . #% I would particularly like to focus my comments on the issues raised by this report on the further harmonisation of private law . #% Under this heading one can identify a single Treaty instead of the several overlapping Treaties -- a single , clearer document that spells out more clearly the objectives and the values of the Union and its competences , what it is responsible for and what it is not responsible for , and how it works , with fewer and clearer procedures . #% Can she assure us that we will stand by the statements which have been made on a number of occasions in this House , at least by Sir Leon Brittan ? #% Indeed , at the New York Stock Exchange 's second annual securities conference a couple of weeks ago , Commissioner Annette Nazareth of the US Securities and Exchange Commission said that the merger seemed to call for a common technology strategy but not a common exchange platform . #% We should congratulate her . #% The British government , the Council of Ministers and the Commission do not want to take any action on Clause 158 of the Treaty . #% 
If you look at America , Switzerland or Germany , that is not normally the case for elections . #% The European Union and all who have sent emergency aid are worthy of the highest praise . #% There are , of course , different reasons for intervening : humanitarian interventions , self-defence , Article 51 , as was used in Afghanistan , and now a new proposal of anticipatory self-defence - the so-called pre-emptive strike - discussed by President Bush for regime change . #% If Parliament rejects this addition , then it must hold itself responsible for the consequences . #% Price alone can never be a complete measure of what is in the public interest , of what is the most advantageous offer . #% I will say that in terms of those compromises financial assistance for such changes is something which will perhaps cause some concern , and maybe the Commission may respond to that particular issue . #% Mr President-in-Office , you assume the leadership of the Union at a crucial period . #% What we need now , as the last speaker said , is much better focus and action . #% It is that hope of the restoration of democracy in Afghanistan and the ending of international terrorism which must be the focus of our attention . #% Mrs Grossetête mentioned the way that medicines are dispensed in certain countries . #% The EU has a historic chance to encourage real democracy in Russia and to support the peaceful settlement of the conflict in Chechnya . #% These ranged from appliances to buildings and transport and included financial incentives , energy efficiency awareness and much more . #% It is also the first time the Commission has adopted public rules on how to deal with infringements of Community law by Member States . #% How did we restructure ? #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I must declare an interest in this subject . #% Once allegations are no longer speculative but are shown to be credible , as is the case , then under European and international human rights instruments Member States have a positive obligation to investigate and to punish anyone responsible for human rights abuses . #% Not that Mr Howard was being honest anyway : Conservative MEPs in this place voted in favour of Turkish entry and are also in favour of Bulgarian and Romanian entry . #% We can control it , use it , put the products in the market place and give people choices , wherever they are in the world , whether they are rich or poor . #% However , then it states : ` The Union 's capacity to absorb new members , while maintaining the momentum of European integration , is also an important consideration in the general interest of both the Union and the candidate countries . ' #% The question obviously is why we have not had that before . #% We know the pressure she has to fight against within the Commission . #% If the EU is not power crazy and really is just an economic bloc , perhaps someone could tell me why it is necessary , for example , to list and protect all species of bat ? #% Mr President , it is clear that improving the quality of legislation is essential to the effective functioning of the internal market and to increasing the competitivity of the European economy . #% It is vital to the competitiveness of Europe as a whole that this industry should be a success . #% The problem is the proximity of the Sangatte camp for refugees : it is too close and should be moved , and makes policing very difficult . #% Mr Duisenberg will surely face a challenge second to none with the introduction of euro banknotes on 1 January 2002 . #% We received answers from 13 of the Member States , so it is quite a comprehensive , if informal , survey . #% Electronic money is not used very much at present , but I am sure that it will become very important in the future . #% But the fact that the President of the Commission has secured a right not available to his predecessors to dismiss any Commissioner , should that ever be necessary , means that we can rest assured - and we shall be vigilant on this - that , if anything new emerges , we will be able to take action . #% That means , if we are to encourage lots of small schemes , that we need even more money . #% However , as the committee recommends , it should remain the prerogative of individual Member States to decide whether to ban discounts on fixed price products and I fully support the committee 's insistence that the principle of subsidiarity must be upheld in this domain . #% Linden took coffee with President Clinton and actually slept in Lincoln 's bedroom . #% In its statement last night in the debate , the Commission took the view that this amendment effectively undermines and sabotages the agreements that we have negotiated . #% Finally , I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Belet , for the very consensual approach that he has adopted on this report . #% Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania have different cultures , traditions , economies and experiences although they have also much shared history and cooperation . #% The amendments talk of this as a fully worked-out policy , but we should at least be consistent . #% It was a report I was particularly interested in and I voted on it . #% Finally , I would point out that it was always through the Lebanon that many of the contacts were made with the other Middle Eastern countries . #% Mr President , I would like to focus my remarks this evening on Mrs Cederschiöld ' s report . #% Despite our dispersal across 25 electoral campaigns , we would be able to reassemble quickly to reinforce the President 's negotiating position . #% I hope that is the message we can endorse here tonight . #% The turnaround is truly remarkable . #% Clearly , as an elected Parliament , we have a duty to protect our citizens , but I fear that the conditionality in paragraph 7 of Mrs Paciotti 's report endangers the whole agreement , for it could hardly be more fundamental to the debate about adequacy or equivalence . #% But tonight I am perfectly happy that we should look at it in the context of how it will develop . #% If our regulations on product liability stifle competitiveness and innovation , I suggest that consumers will be at a major disadvantage as well . #% Stock management issues are also important . #% As an advert from British NGOs said when commenting on changes to English and Welsh planning law : ` Here 's the new nuclear power station . #% Paragraph 19 would seem to indicate a higher figure , but looking at this sensibly and pragmatically , we could get any figure and 1 % can not be ruled out . #% The second train carries European efforts to develop a strong common foreign security and defence policy , a task towards which Turkey will make an extraordinary contribution . #% I think this is wrong , but I would not expect the civil servants , whose jobs are involved , to say anything different . #% In the hardest-hit region of all , Bahr-al-Ghazal , northern-backed forces are reported to have burned crops and grain stores , and here and everywhere else deliveries of emergency food aid have been barred , while people have been eating their seed stock and leaves and dying in swarms . #% Too often we see that the poorest people in the worst quality jobs also live in the worst environment . #% I would also recommend the OECD to Ukraine , but full OECD membership requires WTO membership first , one of the new government 's pressing goals . #% Mr President , much has been said today about the cynicism and hypocrisy of the past , but I want to say to you that there is nothing more cynical or hypocritical than people who have already announced that they were going to vote against the Commission commenting on the process of hearings . #% We have the instruments , but we need to carry them out . #% The Commission ' s initiative takes past experience into account and , in particular , the difficulties encountered in the first phase of reconstruction in Bosnia which , as the House has rightly recalled again this morning , led to delays in implementing those programmes . #% The second split should be the remainder of that amendment . #% It is possible to use alternative chemicals so it is quite right that we ban these dangerous chemicals . #% The Commission is also right in its report , Agenda 2000 , to point out that some countries are further down the road to accession than others . #% The United Kingdom Department of Health has said there are no acceptable alternative sources . #% This relates to accidents in third countries . #% A second problem highlighted by Mr Andersson , and one that we really have to redouble our efforts to tackle , is the need to raise the effective retirement age , not the statutory retirement age . #% The treaty is perhaps more symbolic , but what we do insist upon is working with - and respecting - the nations and , more particularly , the peoples of the Arctic . #% Mr President , this report promotes the stupidity and falsity that is EU citizenship and proceeds to come up with suggestions as to how this ridiculous and failing notion can be promoted . #% Film footage that appears to be that compiled by the local police has got into the hands of the local British National Party who are distributing it . #% On first reading , we also welcome the desire on the part of the Commission to require the data relating to compliance to be made available to the Commission in order to establish a new transparent system accessible to all parties concerned . #% 
It is interesting that , although Mahendra Chaudhry is an Indo-Fijian , twelve out of the 18 members of his cabinet are , as it were , indigenous Fijians and a majority of indigenous Fijian MPs actually supported the Government . #% If my suggestion is followed , it should lead to the adoption of this important text in a single reading . #% Secondly , if every small business in Europe created one more job , we would have dealt with the problem of unemployment in the European Union . #% The challenge is to work out when the European Union should let the market do the driving , and when we should intervene and regulate - when we should intervene , in whose interests and for how long . #% It is often claimed that when sportsmen have failed tests it has been due to their taking legal medication . #% Secondly , has the UK Government applied for compensation , because it should be doing so on behalf of the British farmers who have lost out ? #% What do they hope to achieve ? #% We have had many promises and reports from the Commission , yet little concrete action has been forthcoming . #% EU sugar production of 17 million tonnes will not be distorted ; there will not be a market imbalance because of LDC imports . #% This compromise should be accepted as a package . #% That is the gloomy landscape in which Europe now needs to reinvent its future in order to safeguard its model of economic and social development . #% If there were simple solutions to this tragedy , we would have found them by now . #% The European Council should be an opportunity for other Member States to press France to put its house in order . #% We regret the serious restrictions on freedom of expression and association and the incidents which occurred prior to and during the World Summit on the Information Society . #% Neither does any serious consideration seem to have been given to the problem of labour recruitment . #% Mr President , towards the end of what has been an interesting debate , it is time to get back to what we are talking about , the core of the matter . #% I commend the rapporteur for the work she has done . #% These and others have seen their loved ones killed in the war and yet are unable to be reunited with surviving family members because of the refusal of some governments to grant visas . #% Today in this House we held the annual debate on the European area of freedom , security and justice . #% Now , here it is in a report . #% Thank you very much for coming to London to meet with hedge funds and private equity managers and hear their concerns . #% Finally , I say to the Commissioner : the one thing you should do , apart from listen , is to pay a visit to Sellafield and find out the facts for yourself . #% I am afraid to have to report that the situation of Christians in Iraq , and the Assyrians in particular , continues to deteriorate . #% If so , it will apply to China and other developing economies in the Far East and other parts of the world . #% More than that ; he is calling for an EU model which does not work and is against the wishes of his own voters . #% It is not Turkey that should be in the dock . #% In conclusion , I thank the Portuguese presidency very much . #% You could not give a damn what ordinary people think . #% There is a sense of constitutional settlement , of democratic legitimisation that this package deal has achieved , a sense that previous IGCs have failed to establish . #% I came here today , first and foremost , to express my profound sorrow , but I must also express my concern - all our concern - for Pakistan . #% Mr Pronk and others have explained the taxation issue very well to those - within his own political group and elsewhere - who have concerns about it . #% The big problem that we have had in the last two years has been with Category 4 , especially the Balkans , trying to get the correct amount of money , having arguments with the Council , using the flexibility instrument and all in all not having a satisfactory procedure . #% While I would support the need for such remotely delivered munitions to contain self-destruct or neutralising mechanisms , it would be most unwise to insist on a ban until our armed forces are satisfied that their operations would not be impaired or that they have substitute weapons of equal effectiveness . #% Mr Lehne , you have said in your explanatory note to the report - and indeed the Commissioner has also said just now , and I agree - that the statute will need to focus on the needs of SMEs . #% On Mr Schmidt 's report , it is excellent to see the modernisation of the framework for UCITS by the inclusion of derivatives and OTC derivatives . #% It will be some time before we have even implemented the mechanisms of reform , let alone securing the changes in attitudes , conventions , behaviour and so-called ` culture ' that will result . #% Several Member States have expressed serious concern about this legislation and this has been reflected within all our political groups . #% I believe that the comments were politically motivated , ignoring the very great diversity within Russian-speaking Latvians . #% Drastic changes are needed in 2003 when the Commission will review the cereal , oilseeds and dairy sector . #% The exciting thing about biofuels , biomass and biogas is that there is a great future for it . #% Who benefits ? #% Will the Council actually sit down and discuss this issue with Parliament , so that we can seek a common objective ? #% We are going to have to face up sooner rather than later to the need to have an immigration route as well as an asylum route into the EU , as well as tackling the traffickers . #% With any luck the timing will be good and Mr Patten will be able to raise certain questions with the Russian President . #% First , there is a need to strengthen Europe-wide economic investment policy in order to encourage public and private investment as a crucial element in the stimulation of economic activity . #% The British BSE inquiry which was commissioned by the UK Government at a cost of # 20 million is due to report in November . #% How are we actually going to deal with it and with Ukraine , with which we have still tried to have relations ? #% President Ivanov has helped to add momentum to Macedonia 's EU ambitions , and we hope his request to meet the newly re-elected President of Greece will be reciprocated in the spirit of friendship and neighbourhood relationships . #% Some have fled in fear of their lives , and we should be able to offer them sanctuary and give them every opportunity to put their claim for asylum . #% The Commission has pursued its efforts to obtain a full mandate for some years and , at all times , has emphasized its total commitment to taking detailed account of the concerns and interests of all Member States so that none would encounter any disadvantage whatsoever . #% This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements . #% This irresponsibility continues to cost European citizens , both in terms of bank bailouts and spending cuts as a result of the ensuing recession . #% But our main aim with our amendment is to seek to assist disabled people through mainstream programmes , for example through education , where children should be educated within the mainstream education process and where very basic training for teachers can be more effective not just for those children , but for all children who have suffered emotional problems . #% In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in July , David Blunkett , the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Work and Pensions , said that we must not work against Member States , that different countries have different solutions and that defining best practice is the first step . #% But I personally have no difficulty with a three-year timescale . #% Its commitment to democracy , pluralism and the rule of law guarantees consistency in trade relations . #% I know that our region is not alone in that but I believe that this is something that all regions in the Community should be examining . #% Imagine the pain and suffering , watching helplessly as your home is bulldozed , then to have no knowledge of where you are being taken . #% Mr President , I would like to raise two amendments that were tabled by the PPE-DE Group but rejected in committee , which we have retabled for the plenary . #% It is very telling that in the week EU leaders are in Barcelona , calling for EU businesses to become more competitive , and on the very day that the UK Prime Minister , Mr Blair , is spinning the line that he is so much against red tape , his Socialist MEPs continue to pursue the same old agenda , regardless of the impact on jobs . #% The policy planning unit is going to be very important , but it must link in with other organisations , like the conflict prevention network , which Parliament was instrumental in setting up . #% Mr President , the EU and US should be the two principal forces leading the fight for human rights internationally . #% The level of unemployment in Europe at the moment is the same as when I was elected to this Parliament four-and-a-half years ago , and that speaks volumes . #% We are only here as an advisory Chamber , but colleagues expect us to press the Parliament 's point of view as far as we possibly can . #% However , to achieve all of that we have to build confidence in our consumers . #% Finally , has the disease moved to the United States of America ? #% 
The PPE-DE Group suggested 0.8 m/s2 . #% We had 97 amendments in committee , and we have only five for this plenary session . #% The British Labour members and I have voted in favour of the Swiebel report , which as a whole serves a valuable purpose . #% Mrs Maes is absolutely right that in 20 to 30 years we could well be witnessing a major aviation tragedy every week unless we take action now . #% The timing of this debate is very sad , when so few Members are present in the Chamber and , even more importantly , to vote later . #% This could provide the means of raising living standards for all Yemeni citizens , but in particular those living in poverty , deprivation and squalor , provided that this is not just left primarily to free market forces . #% There is no room at present in heading 4 . #% The issues of transparency and openness are ones the British Conservatives have been championing for many years . #% Mr President , I warmly welcome , on behalf of my colleagues in the United Kingdom Conservative Party , this very elegant and simple proposal for reform of the single market . #% If we are to promote flexible labour markets then we must ensure that those working within them are not put at a disadvantage . #% This political relativism threatens to dilute the unique nature of the Nazi crimes , and in doing so provides an intellectual underpinning to the ideologies of today 's neo-Nazis and fascists , some of whom are with us here today . #% in writing . - As the move towards the conference gathers pace , it is clear that a real chance exists for the EU to make a positive contribution in Cancún . #% Mr President , I want to say that I think today 's resolution on Iraq is very important because it reaffirms that we want to go down the United Nations route . #% That is what an open and competitive market has to be all about . #% Mr Podestà 's report has highlighted underspends in this year 's budget . #% Therefore , it is important that we have flexibility . #% So chocoholics can now munch safe in the knowledge they are doing their bit for the Third World . #% This is a case where even organised crime is involved in the fishing industry , and it is not surprising when so much money is to be made . #% Certain other officious bureaucratic provisions have been removed . #% You talk about principles , but it is vital that the EU is consistent . #% When the communication came , it was , quite frankly , hardly worth the paper it was printed on . #% We need to encourage more research and development , improved higher education and better vocational training , as President Barroso has just emphasised . #% We must follow the CAP principles we have established . #% I believe it is the close working relationship that has developed between Parliament , its various groups and the Commission that has helped to steady the rudder on this one . #% In the same way we believe that the issue of compensation , as raised in Amendment 2 , is already adequately covered by the existing paragraph 6 . #% I wish people would have the courtesy to read and understand what we are suggesting : merely the accepted principle of restitutio in integrum - to put victims back in the position they were in before the incident . #% Mr President , I led the Parliamentary delegation to Buenos Aires . #% I wish to begin by extending a warm welcome to Mr Henderson as the acting President-in-Office to the delights of European Parliament Question Time . #% It is not insignificant that 25 elected governments of our Member States have all come to the conclusion that this new Constitution is the best way forward for the European Union . #% I have never heard so much nonsense in my life . #% We do not want to nanny our citizens , but we want to support them when they exercise the right to freedom of movement that is so precious to all of us . #% Now Tony Blair , far from leading a national debate on the benefits of Europe , is conniving disgracefully in a dangerous and populist attack by Conservatives and the media on the European Convention on Human Rights . #% An increase in the EU budget surely requires more justification than is shown . #% I do not intend to allow my political mandate to be used to interfere with the judges ' judicial mandate . #% Quite clearly , this is going to be one of the most sensitive areas to be investigated , in terms of export subsidies , in terms of the vital need to maintain the rural areas , but also in terms of food safety . #% This review was provided for in the original recommendation and there are several areas concerning the regulation 's implementation which now , several years later , could be substantially improved on the basis of the lessons that we have learned from its implementation . #% In terms of general considerations , there are three that I should like to set out , which have shaped our strategic thinking in the Budgets Committee in presenting this budget to Parliament . #% They were opposed to the Petitions Committee using the Rules of Procedure to produce this report . #% Here in the EU , we constantly reiterate the need to promote integration : sport is the ideal way to achieve this . #% This has meant that we have not really had time in the Economic Committee to produce a report debated in committee , adopt amendments in committee and then present to this House a report that is properly balanced in the way in which the three previous reports are balanced and reflect consensus in the committee . #% Firstly , as colleagues have said , the three million deaths in five years ; there are still one thousand people a day in the Congo dying from the indirect consequences of that war . #% Fortunately , as Sir Neil said , we now have a number of organisations which are working very hard in this sector and the situation has improved . #% Whether one agrees with the justification for the war or not , everyone now must sympathise with the long-suffering Iraqi people , who yearn for stability in their country . #% It is true that some workers would like to work fewer hours , but not if the cut in hours means a drop in pay . #% Yes , the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body , but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament . #% That is what you get when you drop shells on a busy street in Gaza . #% I would also like to make a point that relates to material that people in the House may want to get access to . #% If it does lead to a challenge under the WTO rules then we from the European Union will have to argue our corner vigorously . #% Relative stability is based on track record ; equal access is based on fleet tonnages . #% Other changes can be made without amending the Treaties . #% Unfortunately , in the current economic climate , with many Member States adopting austerity measures and budget reductions necessary to reduce deficits , these areas can often appear neglected and I wish this were not the case . #% If the Council is aware of this , what will it be doing about it ? #% I urge the Commissioner to look at this carefully and see if we can not adopt these measures that would take meat infected with low pathogenic avian influenza out of the circuit and have it destroyed . #% I should like to make a few points . #% It should concentrate action on a few areas where there is the possibility of getting results and then act with consistency and determination . #% There must be a zero tolerance of all cases of mismanagement and fraud and there are three main areas to focus on : #% Many of the care homes and schools are in a bad state and my own constituents in Chelmsford provide admirable support for one particular school at Berkovitsa . #% Some representatives of the European Council can not stand the prospect of being forced to vote and they disapprove of the nature of the Convention itself . #% I know that you will not be able to change the Rule concerned at this particular point in time , but could you please look at it , because in just about every report we have a decent period of time to table amendments , but on the calendar of our sittings we have no time at all . #% What we have before us today is not perfect . #% As we have heard , this is the intention . #% The original six Member States would do well to remember why they formed the Community in the first place and the economic benefits that flow from it . #% Why do people take unnecessary risks ? #% So I think that strong unconditional support for an FTA needs to be revised . #% I am asking for the vote to be postponed until tomorrow . #% Fourthly , there was no evidence of a spread of infection from carcasses during transport or by personnel . #% 
All the more reason , therefore , for the European Parliament to be concerned with the establishment of minimum standards for training , certification and watchkeeping for seafarers . #% We must make sure that where criminality is involved , we use the new technologies to the greatest advantage . #% In the context of this debate , however , we should state quite clearly that crime and criminality are two of the fundamental European growth industries today . #% Could the Commissioner help all of us by saying what mechanisms , approach and analysis he is going to take to investigate this ? #% But the challenge is far from over . #% In light of the amendment tabled by Mr Davies and myself at the end of last year to the common foreign and security policy report and adopted by Parliament , calling on the EU to act as an honest broker between India and Pakistan over the dispute in Kashmir , could we have a Council declaration or an oral question on this matter at the next part-session ? #% I hope , therefore , that the compromises proposed in Amendments Nos 44 , 46 and 48 will be adopted . #% As a member of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union in Britain my view is guided by the balance we strike in railway development . #% I know they need help to recover and reassurance that , at both UK and European level , we will do everything we can to ensure that such a devastating outbreak never occurs again . #% Our citizens and the world 's citizens are in danger . #% We have abstained on this resolution , however , because we believe it attempts to prejudge the outcomes of the period of reflection and because it could be seen as showing insufficient sensitivity to the democratic outcomes of the French and Dutch referenda . #% No Member State is forced to do anything . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Ferber , for all his work and , indeed , thank the Commissioner for his work . #% The alleged massacres of 500 Maoist guerrillas in May , if it is true , will only make the situation worse . #% I hope therefore that this resolution , even if it calls for a study which may provide more objective facts than some of the studies that have come from partisan organizations with an interest in this matter , will nonetheless help confirm the decision taken long ago by the European Union . #% It is not enough to set standards now and then never come back to them . #% We have very few of those lines left available now . #% Safety is one of those areas where we can always find middle ground to achieve what we really want . #% Thirdly , important questions on probity have still not been answered in respect of some of the Commissioners-designate . #% For the Serbs as a whole we must make it clear that , as soon as there is a solution to the problem of Kosovo , we will want to lift sanctions . #% It shows that Somalia is a complex region . #% Some are fellow travellers with racists and xenophobes , while others take the issue far too lightly . #% Take our Amendment 24 , which refers to agencies and bodies created by the institution . #% Mr President , I am sorry to supplement Mr Barroso 's catalogue of strategic priorities -- which has already grown during the debate -- but I hope that the Commission will focus upon the necessity of preventing a collapse in the transatlantic partnership . #% Evidence of flights that have been linked to the CIA is not evidence of rendition , still less evidence of mistreatment . #% Yet what could be more fundamental than our citizens ' access to justice or the way that law is applied and dispensed ? #% Do not send this man back to a war or to possible death . #% It was for that reason that I was keen to see a final agreement on incoming data collection on same-day visits , which we now have in the final agreement , as same-day visits account for a large part of tourism activity . #% Instead we have the suggestion that the Council will review the functioning of these measures in future presidencies and examine how further to increase openness and transparency , including the possibility of amending the Rules of Procedure . #% Intensively produced , bland-tasting produce that looks nice is not real quality as even the big supermarkets are beginning to acknowledge . #% It is interesting to try to look into the future , and I should like to quote from the words of a famous Louis Armstrong song , ` What a wonderful world ' : ` Babies are born , we watch them grow , they 'll learn much more than I 'll ever know ' . #% New standards will be introduced and greater flexibility will open up new markets . #% Secondly to the Commission : will the Commission commit to engaging in joined-up thinking on the issues of alternatives to oil ? #% I therefore urge the House to give this measure its full support . #% This new legislation will require manufacturers to prove chemicals are safe before they are used , ensure that the most dangerous chemicals are replaced with safer alternatives , and introduce a right to know about the health rules of chemicals in products we use . #% in writing . - I voted against the Gauzès report on the AIFM Directive because it disadvantages an important part of the United Kingdom 's most important industry - financial services . #% I hope the Commission and Council agree that the standard of directives guaranteeing fundamental rights should be high . #% That is why it is important that there should be an overall discussion of what potential sustainable growth rates of wages are in each of the component parts of the euro zone economy , and why this will actually help deliver low inflation combined with low unemployment . #% I also welcome the amendment to allow increased production of crops for animal feed so that we can get away from the unnatural practice of feeding ruminant animals on animal remains . #% The new rule , however , leaves us no option but to vote against certain reports . #% Exploitation is harmful and irresponsible . #% There are tough choices , but once again in the gallery here tonight , I would like those people listening to this debate to take away with them the belief that we are going to actually have a society based on full employment , that the road to Lisbon will be the end of our journey , and that some concrete results will actually come out of it . #% Some of those suspects are British citizens . #% I give you one example : on 7 April this year we fear that in the Eid-El-Kabir in France the French authorities will not be enforcing the animal welfare regulations he quite rightly points to . #% I am therefore delighted that Commissioner Kyprianou has agreed to look into this matter and I would urge all colleagues who have examples of these in their constituencies -- and there are many of you , I know -- to write to him with information so that he can complete his dossier . #% Most of the technical amendments we put forward were accepted . #% I look also to Commissioner Frattini to lead the effort to greatly improve the generalised protection of both women and minorities . #% We want more information on thresholds for graduation and on how much the GSP will be improved for countries that are not graduated . #% I have friends and acquaintances there and have been there . #% I rise on the minutes of last Friday in which I am referred to as having spoken on the subject of membership of the British Conservative Party . #% This is the kind of injustice which the Fair Trade movement is dealing with . #% Visas are necessary and useful tools in providing controls . #% However , should they fail in their endeavours then , at the second reading stage , Parliament , through the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , will act and legislate in this area . #% When speaking to stakeholders in this industry , Mrs Scallon found that they were very concerned about the concept of flagging out , which was one of the root causes of the sharp decline in EU seafarers and the increase in the use of third-country ratings and junior officers . #% In other words I support the principle that if you are on secondment , and we are only here on a five-year term after all , the rate of pay should be at national levels , but reimbursement of expenses should be at a common level . #% I have always argued that this enlargement is going to make or break the European Union . #% I am a great supporter of lobbies , I believe profoundly in their ability to come here and try to influence us . #% Whilst I do not know anyone who eats raw rabbit or raw poultry , I know many people -- some are Members of the European Parliament -- who eat red meat that is either raw or close to raw . #% We should exempt smaller businesses from part of the proposals , as proposed by the committee , and it is especially important that we recognise that there are particular concerns related to smaller businesses , particularly those which are only raising capital and doing business in one part of the European Union . #% I have heartily enjoyed the way we have worked together on this and I am pleased to say that the work in her report represents our joint work . #% But that is just shoddy management and really should not occur in a Bank like this . #% Commissioner Vitorino said that there was agreement in Mexico last weekend . #% These improvements are due in no small part to the input of the European Parliament into the Convention and the IGC . #% It is a report which will be of great interest to the Convention , which is itself studying these questions . #% Yes , we believe both sides must honour the association agreements with ourselves in the European Union , but we do not believe the threat of quick suspension of those agreements is a constructive step at this stage . #% Surely we should not be subsidizing very rich countries to produce what you have just said is a very unprofitable crop when there is absolutely no economic reason for doing so ? #% 
As Mrs Breyer has already set out , our group believes that the participation of civil society is vitally important to the formulation and implementation of European health policy . #% A previous speaker spoke very eloquently about the evil of drugs , and Mr Beysen referred to the tobacco vote a couple of days ago . #% I welcome this statement from the Commissioner . #% The biggest exporters of such products are the Dutch plant auctions . #% The Council was not going to agree to anything more at this stage . #% Members may or may not know that there is a tax in the UK on petrol to take account of CO2 emissions a green tax which works very well . #% That is the sort of message we want to hear . #% I find it totally amazing that groups in Parliament will vote against this amendment . #% Secondly , in economics . #% If they protect their market from a deadly disease , surely they will protect it against minor infringements of EU standards . #% While we value the role of the EU in supporting human rights , we believe that human rights regulation and legislation , as in so many areas dealing with the relationship between the citizen and the state , is a matter for national governments , and we do not welcome an extension of EU intervention in this area . #% My British colleague , Mr Bushill-Matthews , who alone voted against it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , informs me that he will now be supporting the report , which indicates how it has progressed during its various stages . #% That is why they dislike the convention . #% But the Turks should think about the impact on their own society . #% This is another democratic deficit . #% - Madam President , I wholeheartedly applaud the efforts of my Labour colleague , David Bowe , to put forward measures to control the release of GMOs into the environment . #% Frankly , that is unacceptable . #% This is just another example of Labour 's positive approach to Europe delivering concrete results to the people of Britain . #% The common foreign and security policy is being seen as a total sham ! #% in writing . - The British Conservative delegation has traditionally given a free vote to all its Members on the issue of the death penalty . #% Moreover , although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice , I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations . #% So , we have no hesitation in supporting both Mr Van Velzen and Mr Hoppenstedt . #% The moral of the story is that they had learnt nothing from history . #% Equally , the European Union should , when formulating policy towards South-East Asia , raise the profile of this issue in order that we in the Foreign Affairs Committee can have a more substantive reason to have a debate in our Chamber in a few months ' time . #% And what do we do in the Union when there is a problem of divergence ? #% You say that there are different types of abstention . #% In this particular case there is a prima-facie case of abuse of internationally recognized human rights . #% I have written to the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , saying that this not only dealt with complaints but also the right to petition Parliament . #% The report is accurate and primarily recognises that current ongoing bilateral confidence-building talks between the Indian and Pakistani Governments remain the best strategy to achieve a just and enduring peace between these two nuclear-armed states . #% There is no reason why they should not be able to decide for themselves whether to levy the zero rates . #% Mr President , I want to start by speaking from a specifically British viewpoint on India . #% Far be it from the Commission to suggest how Parliament should respond , but I know it will seize eagerly on any opportunity . #% Mr President , I rise to introduce my report on transatlantic relations . #% I agree with Mr Pirker , and it is probably the only thing I will agree with him on if we do vote on the Ludford report . #% Instead I support the development of tests to determine migration limits , and for these to be legislated on in due course , rather than a long-term ban as proposed . #% I am impressed with the Commission 's commitment to proportionality in the regulation of general and business aviation . #% We can do more then we are doing at the moment . #% It has an effect on other sectors of the retail trade as the Commissioner has pointed out . #% There are new cooperative provisions in there , there will be new small businesses accessing the single market and all of them will need access to SOLVIT if we really are going to get the economic benefits that the single market promises . #% Indeed now , as Mr Hughes has just said , we move into the difficult area of codecision which can help us . #% Yes , many farmers are struggling at the moment , but large , richer farmers , though profits are down , are very far from the breadline . #% I understand it must be difficult for the Commission to give more precise answers in these final months . #% Since the European Union has so profoundly failed to protect my country from price-fixing by European energy companies , the need becomes even greater . #% We were founded on human rights and anti-discrimination . #% It is good that lessons have been learned from previous IDA work . #% The Second World , as I understand it , was the then-Communist dictatorship bloc . #% We must not overload this statute with things that it was not designed to carry , otherwise it will sink very quickly indeed . #% Second point : NRAs . #% Mr President , I had not followed the last report in any detail but if Commissioner Wallström is in the same sort of mood as Commissioner Bolkestein , I am glad I am not tabling any amendments today . #% I commend this package to the House . #% It talked about a renewed upturn in the spring of 1996 which is gathering momentum and is expected to turn into a self-sustained expansion . #% On behalf of the Socialist members of the committee , I should like to say how much we identify with what Mr Viola has said about the sad death of Vice-President Lucas Pires . #% Mrs McKenna in her impassioned speech a few moments ago said that we must ensure that asylum seekers and others are not treated as criminals . #% Indeed , I would like to see these institutions working much closer together throughout the CFSP . #% A lot of money , of course , is involved in this decommissioning process . #% The Turkish armed forces are to be congratulated on the satisfactory completion of the first half of their span of command of ISAF . #% It is therefore important that Members do not need to abstain on the vote . #% For example , proposals in this House for a Common Members ' Statute would expose Members of this House to criticism from national members of parliament in their own country if MEPs were to be paid significantly more . #% It specifically said that , whilst under the present modus vivendi this resolution could not have any binding impact upon its actions , it would be taken fully into account . #% But the issue that now comes before Parliament is how we can best ensure that this measure and all the measures for safety at sea are swiftly implemented by Member States rigorously and fairly . #% Organisations like Oxfam have made some very detailed proposals in this area . #% It is far too simplistic to say , as Mr Farage and Mr Kirkhope did , that the people have spoken and they have spoken against the Constitution . #% And who should judge this ? #% That has been partly because of the over-centralization and the politicization of the common fisheries policy . #% The resolution is a basis for action now . #% Again , that is a significant step forward for the health of cosmetics users . #% 
I doubt both whether Amendment No 1 serves its intended legal purpose and whether it could have the effects that Mr Watts fears . #% I congratulate heartily our rapporteur on her original strategy and I hope what will be her achievement of obtaining continuing consensus . #% I worked closely with disabled people 's organisations , the Commission and fellow MEPs , and I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for their cooperation . #% We accept the Commission 's view that metallic mercury is by far the most relevant substance in terms of quantity , as compared to mercury compounds and products containing mercury , and that extending the export ban would be very premature at this stage . #% Fourthly , the inclusion , as has already been mentioned , of incitement or pressure to discriminate - that is very important . #% We need to exercise the greatest caution when dealing with those . #% On the issue of the fight against terrorism , I welcome paragraphs 101 to 108 as they deal directly with issues pertaining to the current situation in many countries , including some European states , where citizens who follow the Islamic faith are being targeted in a systematic fashion for no reason other than the fact that they choose to follow the Islamic faith or they are perceived to be Muslim . #% I would like to think that the Council , were they to receive a proposal from the Commission , would behave emphatically in support of digital radio . #% That at the very least should be the basis on which Parliament participates in this IGC . #% Similarly , in Germany there are problems with the ability of the German economy to move in a way which will help the country meet the 3 % deficit requirement . #% These were very specific questions and I would be very grateful for an answer from the presidency . #% Negotiations on the accession of ten countries to the EEA were launched in Brussels just last week . #% Is it not interesting how keen governments are to standardise car heaters , windscreen wipers and spirit bottles but , when real people need help , as usual the European Union is found wanting ? #% While we talk about the fact that the Union intends to be a partner with the United States in managing the global economy , the Commission and the Council have to show confidence that with the coming of the euro we are actually going to exercise that responsibility . #% Mr President , I also would like to welcome this report and commend it to this House . #% If we go back to first principles , the United Kingdom is the fourth largest economy in the world , the third largest trading nation in the world and the head of a Commonwealth with 30 % of the world 's population in it . #% Secondly , in terms of the objections which have been raised in that quite passionate and impressive philippic from Ms McKenna just now - and she almost converted me - the fact of the matter is that when we come to the point of nisin , it does not have medical applications . #% Every Member will continue to be able to insist on his or her own language in all instances . #% If that is so , why do so many measures , large and small , like this one , have to be recast to conform to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ? #% ADRs which are a form of bona fide privatised law , agreed upon by the parties and legislators , must be the first and the main means of resolving disputes . #% We need to be accountable , more transparent , and we need to reform priorities . #% I disagree with Mr Evans on this point . #% Mr President , Russia is a vast country and its contribution - historically speaking -- to European culture is immense . #% Mention has already been made of the UK releases today , and of course I welcome that development , but I am also interested in who is defending the interests of the remaining detainees , whose governments may not have a special relationship with the United States . #% Within the means at its disposal the Commission is working with the United Nations mission in Kosovo - Unmik - through the European Agency for Reconstruction , to eliminate these threats according to priorities for intervention . #% Normally I would regard this as a private matter and not my concern . #% It was a compromise . #% Despite the rapid advances made , I would like to see all countries producing publicly available annual export reports in a commonly agreed format . #% At the two colleges in my region the number of courses relating to farming has now fallen to 40 % in one case , and the remaining 60 % of the courses relate to horses and small animals . #% Mr President , I am running short of inspiration about what to say on the subject of the Members ' Statute . #% Petitions to the European Parliament and two fact-finding missions attest to this fact . #% I acknowledge that they may bring about benefits in terms of the reduced use of pesticides and herbicides , that there are no proven health risks - or none yet established - and that GM crops could , across the world , be grown in circumstances which would not permit the growth of conventional crops . #% That is what is at stake , and those of you who are contemplating amending this proposal with the result that it is not in place on 1 May will have to answer to manufacturers in your constituency when a container load of counterfeit goods from China arrives through an accession country on their doorstep in June . #% The Prime Minister says it is time for Europe to make choices . #% Couple this with the economic effect on SMEs - in the UK , # 2.6 billion ; Germany , EUR 1.7 billion - and this report is positively dangerous in today 's economic climate . #% Our group has strategies for both these budgets , and they have by and large been implemented as we reach the current stage of the budget procedure . #% Support for it would therefore damage the trust and credibility the EU has earned with its projects and in its relations with local communities . #% Mr President , the concerns about increasing quantities of electrical and electronic equipment entering the waste system have been well rehearsed . #% Mr President , the civil war in Iraq has inevitably meant that in recent months the media have focused almost exclusively on security . #% I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire , a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding . #% in writing . - I will be supporting the report on the adoption of the single currency by Slovakia on 1 January next year . #% It is going to push for the capital requirements directive and much , much more . #% Central to that declaration was the question of institutional stability , which we all seem to be forgetting as we go about welcoming countries into the Union . #% Madam President , I also wish to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her own-initiative report on the impact of biotechnology on agriculture , which sets out in a very balanced way the opportunities and risks presented by the rapidly expanding development of biotechnological processes . #% What we can not defeat is not the prejudice but the laws that exist and are exercised in sovereign power by Member States . #% I do not think I have heard such a feeble statement as ` the Council is not responsible for the protection of EU citizens abroad , that is just up to the Member States ' . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs . #% It is sadly acknowledged across the political spectrum , as we are hearing today , that the British Presidency has not achieved what it said it would . #% The UK does not want it ! #% While we need , of course , to support the agricultural sector in the EU , and that is made clear in Mr Schwaiger ' s report , we also have to recognise the need for developing economies beyond reaching markets to have access to food security so that people have enough to eat . #% However , the measures called for in Article 18 of the Avilés Perea report represent an infringement of the Member States ' right to determine their own criminal justice systems and represent measures to introduce harmonisation of criminal law . #% With the timetable which we have set ourselves : does the Swedish Presidency agree that this necessitates transitional periods , and , finally , can we confirm that no new hurdles will be placed in the path of the candidate countries . #% When I look up the CVs of Members of this Parliament , I find that nobody has ever had any serious responsibility for a small company in their lives . #% We have had this , but still airlines are avoiding payment . #% Will the Commission now be more explicit , especially about the EUR 1 billion per annum shortfall that the Commissioner has just mentioned ? #% We have , as the EPP-ED group , submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report , entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee . #% We are now seeking the cooperation of the Council and Parliament in the course of consideration of the modernisation of the Staff Regulations next year . #% The Commissioner again is quite right that when the potential for deployment of a product is recognised , the main barriers it faces are financial ones . #% I would agree that health should be taken out of this directive ; it should never have been there in the first place , and many of us look forward to a speedy proposal from the Commission on the issues of patient mobility and not service mobility , which is why it should not have been in the directive in the first place . #% The fishing industry is a factor in the UK 's GDP to which contributions to the EU budget are geared , and that comes on top of the destruction of a priceless natural resource . #% We should investigate that more . #% The alarmists talk as if Turkey is going to join in a month 's time . #% I understand the Court of Auditors is looking at this budget line for this year and on that basis we would be happy , despite our reservations , to grant discharge or to recommend the granting of discharge . #% Let him show that he is serious , lift the barrier on that road , respond to our calls for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners and recognise the results of the 1990 elections which gave a landslide victory to the National League for Democracy . #% I would like to pick up on the point made by Mrs Schörling on behalf of her colleagues in the Verts/ALE Group , and by others , that the contractual terms clearly have to include factors other than economic criteria -- as we have seen from the famous Helsinki bus case . #% We should wait to see what this inquiry says . #%
