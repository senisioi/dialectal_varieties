It is important to emphasise that the Eastern Partnership should not by itself preclude the possibility that some of those countries should one day join the EU as full members . #% Others said that this is a constraint on our rights to table amendments in plenary and we should not go down that road at all . #% The trade in gas between Russia and EU Member States remains commercially viable just as long as each has something the other wants . #% Mr President , the speech by the Greek Communist Member who condemned the USA as an imperialist occupier of Iraq is a little rich from a party which in its day supported the USSR 's invasion and crushing of the Hungarian uprising in 1956 , the Czechoslovak ` Prague Spring ' in 1968 and the Afghan invasion in 1979 . #% The blue smoke from generators , lawnmowers , pumps and so on tells its own story . #% MEPs now need to turn our attention towards the discharge procedure for 2009 , which is underway in the Committee on Budgetary Control , and introducing changes to ensure stronger accounting procedures are put in place . #% In congratulating Mr Vallvé on his report , I note there are many areas of agreement with my own parallel report on guidelines for Objective 1 and 5b areas over the same period . #% That is not what the directive says . #% Recently , our Temporary Committee on Extraordinary Rendition heard Javier Solana say he had no power to check whether Member States were upholding their human rights commitments . #% When I speak to British groups , I often start with the question : do you want to be in the European Union ? #% Mr President , I should like to follow the very broad hint given by Mr Nordmann and adopt the amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party . #% Mr President , well , is n't it all lovely ? #% We also need to find other permissible ways of reducing the costs associated with transport to island and outlying communities . #% The most personal information may be collected , including sexual preferences and bank account details . #% Colleagues have referred to the very considerable financial benefits and advantages that can be now gained , which makes this issue even more difficult . #% In this debate we are looking ahead to the distant date of 2013 , and although useful policy documents exist we have yet to see them . #% There is always a risk that one can stifle an initiative by too much bureaucracy . #% Furthermore , the democratic oversight of national intelligence services is , in any case , primarily a matter for national parliaments . #% I say to Commission Frattini and the entire Commission , as well as to this House , that if we do nothing when we see people beaten to death , vilified and discriminated against then we are condoning and becoming complicit in those beatings , in the hate-speak , the defamation and the ill-treatment . #% On behalf of my group I would like to caution the Commission not to go ahead at this stage with shifting agricultural expenditure from category 1 to category 4 . #% Let us be certain whether our existing rules would have prevented it happening here , and let us be certain that any new rules would prevent it happening . #% We keep being told that Berlin is set in concrete . #% Those are not threats , but statements . #% The majority of LDCs are still galloping in the dark in this regard . #% The Transport Committee is now demanding action to reduce this figure and is sending a signal to the maritime industry that we are not prepared to tolerate this state of affairs much longer . #% The European Union wants a mobile , flexible workforce . #% Mr President , I congratulate my colleague , Mr Titley , on a concise and well written report . #% The fact is that he should not have been in France and the Council must now take vigorous and effective steps to close the loopholes and galvanise international moves against President Mugabe before the tragedy of Zimbabwe is again overshadowed by other international crises . #% I simply do not know whether a deal is possible in the course of the next few months . #% As a result of the petition the Commission very properly submitted , over a year ago , questions to the United Kingdom Government . #% I hope those who supported the amendment on liberalisation , who voted against a horizontal directive and voted for the final report will be able to explain to their colleagues in local and regional government why they are not defending more strongly the public services their colleagues have to deliver . #% Indeed , disposing of electronic waste has yet to be dealt with effectively and shifting the onus onto the producer may well prove to be an effective solution . #% Now , of course , Troubled Waters is not set in the real world . #% Indeed , I must say that when Mr Kinnock referred to a family reunion I feel like something of an interloper . #% We should have acted earlier . #% During the course of the past two years , Parliament has been able to use its codecision powers to give this legislation some teeth . #% That has to be a key issue for the Commission to work on and bring forward as quickly as possible , along with American and Japanese researchers . #% Those who reject in principle the European Arrest Warrant are the apologists for mafia criminals and absconding robbers , rapists and terrorists . #% It has already been said that each euro invested from public funds generates another three in business terms . #% We must bear in mind that countries in Central Asia like Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are looking west to the EU for assistance and engagement . #% Firstly , I want to thank her for quite rightly bringing this matter to the attention of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and then taking the initiative to draw up the report . #% Commissioner Diamantopoulou made the point very clearly that there are two monsters facing us here in Europe , terrorism and racism . #% Nevertheless , regulations on labelling have to reflect day-to-day realities . #% We must continue our work on Turkey and , as Mr Swoboda says , show greater solidarity with that country , particularly at this time . #% I heard only yesterday that to this day not a single cent of that money has been given to Euronews , which is one of the best ways for citizens in the European Union to find out about European affairs . #% But we welcome the reassurance we have heard today that the reforms will not touch matters for the IGC and the Convention , because it is essential that the Council does not become the legislature and executive and break the current balance between the institutions . #% I suggest that the Commission 's reluctance to take any further steps and propose legislation will now encourage businesses across Europe that are rather slapdash about protecting private data , as they will now be able to say that there will not be any legislation to punish them so they can easily let this slip . #% Now , perhaps that might be more tenuous were we to look at it in a worldwide context . #% We agree with some of the measures proposed in the report , including the establishment of joint investigation teams . #% We welcome too the intention to bring about better enforcement of the rules and the action planned to fight illegal fishing and ensure sustainable fisheries beyond EU waters . #% Prior to that there had hardly been any interest in a Community fisheries policy because the founding six had virtually no fishing resources . #% This is the first time that he has been able to come and tell us definitely that legal action is going to be taken , and we have a lot of questions . #% Lastly there is the intensity of the debate , which needs to be developed with the best technological means available . #% I can now report that we have looked at the matter further . #% Thus , while I would obviously support the idea of rationalising aviation insurance , I can not accept Commission attempts to superimpose a European dimension on what should be a matter for nation states . #% Unfortunately , as Mr Kellett-Bowman has said , members of the Council who are the protagonists in the great problem we have with CEDEFOP are not here to listen to our complaints and those of the Court of Auditors on the staffing question . #% All those issues need to be resolved . #% We also believe that the Fischler proposals will ensure the future of European agriculture in an enlarged Europe of 25 Member States . #% No , again . #% Citizens look to their elected representatives to ensure the planning for their protection is efficient and reliable and in place . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , I come from the West Midlands , the home of the so-called ` Tipton Taliban ' , who were detained at Guantánamo . #% I suspect that in microcosm this may be one of a much larger series of problems that we shall be experiencing in the Union in the not-too-distant future . #% Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary . #% By the same token , it is no use the rapporteurs gathering us together to vote for a European social model . #% China 's accession to the WTO is to be welcomed , but the EU must not become complacent : human rights and the UN conventions that China has ratified are still far from fully respected . #% Mr President , I too should like to thank the Commissioner and our rapporteur for their work on this issue . #% 
I believe that they are wrong and that is why we have the extension for two years and also the extension after that for one year . #% Firstly , the IGC in Amsterdam next week . #% So I endorse Mr Graça Moura 's comment that it was regrettable that the historic environment was not included in the forum on cultural cooperation last year . #% I very much hope that the decisions reached by ASEP II in Manila , and the decision of this Parliament in voting for the Maaten report , will endorse the call for another meeting of ASEP to be held to complement the proposed 2004 ASEM meeting in Hanoi . #% Everyone in this House , myself included , has had many encounters with people who have suffered grievously for the beliefs they hold and for resisting oppression . #% in writing . - I welcome this report and was pleased to vote for its main text with little exception . #% There is no doubt that civil aviation has grown considerably over the last ten years and it is predicted to continue growing in the foreseeable future . #% It would be helpful for us to have at least some input into the formulation of ACP countries ' strategy papers , which are the key instrument for the development of the Millennium Development Goals , now specifically referred to in the partnership agreement . #% My group has submitted a small number of amendments which aim to highlight the importance of greater transparency and environmental commitment in the work of the EIB and also , in particular , to ensure that the EIB applies the highest ethical standards possible in project financing , including withdrawal from any project carried out in breach of national legislation or where corrupt enterprises are involved . #% However , we still have to ensure the full participation of , and full rights for , disabled people such as the victims of landmines , people who have deliberately had disability inflicted upon them as part of war , or who have developed disability because of chronic diseases unknown to us nowadays within the European Union . #% Therefore , if the Commission does finally get around to sending us a report in five years ' time , we might just get a chance to see what this muddled arrangement has produced . #% We would also like to ensure that our amendments on the Committee of the Regions are maintained in the light of what we have just read in the OLAF report in the confidential reading room . #% The compromise reached here was to reduce the figure allocated for office holders down from EUR 1.2 million to EUR 400 000 and , of course , documented evidence of receipts must be provided when any claims are made . #% I put it to all of you that we have a duty to deal with this and put an end to this suffering and this toll of death . #% We should recognise the situation in Germany and Austria and allow an extension on the use of some of these brand new plants . #% Other sports have a lot of money sloshing around . #% I hope , Commissioner , that you will be able to help us more than your predecessor could . #% Could I also ask you to contact High Representative Solana to ask him to make urgent representations to the Sudanese , and to the African Union to make sure that the latter 's mandate can be extended until such time as that United Nations force can be deployed in this tragic region of Sudan . #% You are only there because of a distortion in the UK electoral system ; you had a manifesto commitment in 1997 , but it seems to have been forgotten . #% One of the most important proposals we have worked on here is the liberalisation of electronic communications , a single framework for a converging sector . #% I suggest that this is a clear case of when we should observe the precautionary principle that if even 50 % of the threats implied by our current state of scientific knowledge prove to be real , then we are facing a very serious and very complicated challenge indeed . #% If he could give me that assurance now , we will have no unpleasantness later in the day . #% You will be aware of the NGOs that have given us video evidence of how this legislation has been by-passed and ignored . #% If you need an explanation as to why there is growing disenchantment with the European Union , just look at this directive and the many more like it . #% It says that women are of a lower status than men . #% So , Mr President , this is part of the process of the moral politics that Mr Milinkevich talked about , but it is only part of it . #% What they would all agree is that we must make sure that we get value for the limited amount of money that we have to spend on culture . #% We should not impose a ten-year regulation on looking at these quotas , but certainly should impose five years as a maximum period before we review the change . #% If the first Barroso team is rejected , we look forward to seeing the second Barroso team as soon as is practicable . #% Much of the solution is in Israel 's hands , but Palestine and the neighbouring states must respond . #% They were being fed on maize as well as milk , so that they were not anaemic , and we were assured that the resulting meat was top-quality white meat for which there was a very good market within Europe . #% While many people quite rightly consider that burglary is wrong , there is not somehow the same feeling about , for example , the illegal taking and using of intellectual property , for example , pirated CDs or using Napster to get other people ' s music off the Internet . #% If we are to give the Community power in this area of competence - and we should - then it should also be underpinned by the sort of balance achieved by the Community itself signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights . #% It is important that we give the right message to Member States that are receiving European funding through the medium-term financial assistance . #% It is the view of the ACP countries , as Mr Fruteau has intimated , that they have been abandoned and betrayed by what is on the table now . #% As , for example , the statistics quoted appear to be contrary to official UK figures , it brings into question the wider points of the report . #% Firstly , I call on Romania to settle its outstanding maritime border dispute with Ukraine over Snake Island . #% Let me just deal with the reality of this . #% It is very interesting when you look at the statistics because the exact reasons become clear . #% Mr President , most of what needs to be said has been said already . #% Could you look into the circumstances of this : where are the limits of this Parliament and what rights do we have to exclude such people from our premises ? #% In this situation all the options are dangerous but the most dangerous option is doing nothing at all . #% In the conclusions from the presidency , under the comments on job creation and competitiveness , all it says is that the Council will take note of the Commission 's proposals on the budgetary issues . #% In voting not to give discharge to the Commission , we are actually making sure that the Commission knows firstly , that we do not want it to resign and , secondly , that we want it to sort the problems out . #% My final point , very briefly , is that there have been concerns in the context of extraordinary rendition . #% Consequently , the Legal Affairs Committee voted unanimously to restore the original amendments in the first reading and to return to these in the second reading . #% Vice-Chairman of the S&D Group . - Unemployment could rise to 27 million in the European Union next year , turning this financial and economic crisis into a social crisis . #% We look forward to working with you to deliver the continued benefits for all citizens in the European Union . #% There are difficulties which we well know in obtaining private capital for initial investment in this area . #% European taxpayers have read the extensive press coverage about this building and they possibly think that we are all mad . #% So , be on notice : if you block that amendment , you block progress , you block this House from getting an open procedure that will lead to a statute and you stop this Parliament becoming worthy of the name of parliament and you will leave our citizens even more bemused and sceptical . #% Mr President , it is very sad that we are having this debate tonight and that we need to give GBP 150 million in funding to help the fishing industry . #% How does the Commission itself propose to ensure continuity of contracts during the switch over from national currencies to the euro ? #% It means an end to child labour and exploitation and the awful trades in children . #% I wonder what the public would say if we asked them about this . #% How refreshing it will be to hear someone who has the intelligence and honesty to doubt the ideological orthodoxies of ever-closer European Union and climate change . #% Mr President , I was privileged to visit Lebanon for the first time some 20 years ago as a journalist , and have followed the unhappy events in that country over the years . #% I hope that in 2003 - if not before - we make sure that all of Parliament 's buildings are accessible to disabled people - they are not at the moment - and that all EU Member States are aware of the problems that disabled people face . #% The central point is that , if the primary role of Parliament is scrutinising the Commission , then that is exactly what it should be doing . #% When we seek , as we do , an end to animal tests , we have to take account of human interests too . #% Gugu Dlamini announced in a rally in Johannesburg last December that she was HIV positive . #% I hope that you will give this your support today . #% We have seen that in the opposition from some Members today . #% Madam President , we are not having a debate on it , but it is somewhat disingenuous of the staff committee to say that they were not organizing it when they had put posters all around the building convening it . #% But you do not throw away the whole report for that : we have put it into the legislative resolution and we hope that you , Madam President , will be able to set out exactly what our reasoning is . #% But there are still issues of concern , that the rapporteur 's amendments address , and that we would wish to support . #% 
As has been explained , the patent in question was examined prior to the coming into effect of the 1998 directive in September 1999 , but it was issued after that date and , as has been said , a mistake was made in the form in which it was granted . #% I am sure that this will be forthcoming . #% I have not been so directly involved with the discussions on these programmes in Parliament of late but some five years ago I was co-author with Mrs Pack of Parliament 's report on the first Socrates programme . #% With my party , however , I will of course be monitoring closely any attempt to reform the UN . #% Similarly , on migration policy , let us have a fair , effective policy that links development and migration policy , one that makes our borders much more secure . #% Indeed , I pay credit to Louise 's local constituency MEPs , Mrs Read and Mr Whitehead , who have followed this through the parliamentary process . #% Can we have your assurance that your senior team is going to be open-minded and looking at these new solutions ? #% My case rests there . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the crisis in Greece of course dominated the headlines following the European Council but the meeting itself also took important first steps in the Europe 2020 initiative . #% I do not wish to underestimate the very serious issues that must be addressed . #% Finally , let us put more effort into ensuring that there is no difference in approach between the Europeans and the United States . #% I do , however , reject a number of the report 's observations and conclusions which are incorrect , in particular those relating to the legality of culls , suggested breaches of animal welfare legislation , suggested breaches of environmental legislation and suggested bio-security lapses . #% Although , as you say , theft is an offence in all Member States , I am talking specifically of the offence of reprogramming the mobile phones . #% Therefore , the European Parliament must be fully involved as a co-legislator . #% We should remember the economic benefits that have flowed to us from EU membership . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report but concentrate my contribution on rural development . #% The last few years remaining of the ECSC operating budget will be among the most important , perhaps not for the size of the operations carried out under its aegis , but because they are the last chances to do something . #% We have , as always , been asked to produce an interim report but , to report properly we need all the evidence , all the studies , all the answers to our inquiries to be available . #% The Commissioner was right when he said that enlargement is a real challenge and it is not one that we have by any means addressed yet . #% However , not all movement is upward : some countries , through circumstances entirely beyond their control , may now be in a worse position than when the scheme was renewed . #% I therefore assume that you will consult Parliament before any final decision is taken . #% The truth is that five socially conscious individuals who make up the awards committee in Norway have arguably done more than this European Union , the US or the rest of the international community to put pressure on the Chinese Government to reform . #% Will it be like the URBAN programme and the URBAN pilot projects , with just twenty or twenty-five towns able to participate or will there be the opportunity for towns and cities throughout our continent to take part ? #% Mr President , this shows the folly of making policy on the hoof . #% Recent events in Belgium have shown that BSE can occur in states which felt they were free of it and that mistakes can be made in analysis and in the final destiny of the carcasses concerned . #% Could I also ask the President-in-Office if the final decision on action in this area will be taken by unanimity or by a qualified majority ? #% But the applicant countries must also understand that none of them is as yet in the European Union . #% Almost simultaneously , a decision was being taken to make drastic changes to the sugar regime that has been in place in the European Union for many years . #% We in the European Union are rightly proud of our deep and profound relationship with Egypt . #% The inclusion of data on accessibility to tourist accommodation for persons with reduced mobility , which was the only real sticking point that we had with Council , is also now an important inclusion . #% The French will govern themselves , as all of us should do , as grown-up democracies . #% The United States wants to make the world a safer place . #% For its part , the Sri Lankan authorities need to address the concerns expressed by friends in the international community so there is no excuse for GSP + status to be compromised . #% They are extremely concerned for the same reasons as my Danish colleague . #% Firstly , we have to provide compensation , retirement , or whatever you call it , for those fishermen who go out of business and fish no longer . #% We must not allow any difference in other areas of policy to undermine our unambiguous solidarity . #% I hope agreement will be reached to postpone them for one month so that they take place on the same day , which will help raise turnout and make a legitimate connection , in the sense of a Europe of the regions . #% It is only to establish that they are not put under intolerable pressure and that every possible safety means is employed . #% Compensation amounting to EUR 7.5 billion is on the table for European farmers . #% British Labour MEPs are also very concerned that important British groups are objecting to this proposal , and we should all be concerned when British marine pilots and , in particular , British ships ' officers are recommending that this proposal be voted down on safety grounds alone . #% I should like to set their minds at rest : the object of Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 is : ` to give the public a right of access to documents of the institution which is as wide as possible . #% Hastings and Rye MP , Mike Foster , has brought to my attention the need for the Marine Fishing Agency and the Commission to end discriminatory and distorting practices , especially in the catching of cod along the UK south coast , and particularly his own constituency Hastings and Rye , which we both represent . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , as the Commissioner has said , he agrees with this resolution , and it reiterates everything that the EU-India Free Trade Agreement could encourage - investment , the elimination of tariffs , non-tariff barriers , etc. . #% Now the EU wants to stamp its dead hand of inefficiency on it . #% We know that some Member States have active relationships with NGOs , and we wanted as well to make sure that local authorities , which often deliver much of what is required under the common system , also had an opportunity to be included . #% The Commission has reacted promptly to the initiatives taken by certain Member States and , in particular , by the Danish authorities in the framework of the Community rapid alert system . #% This directive represents another step on the road to a police state . #% It is a strange document . #% I welcome this initiative and I hope it can be put into effect as soon as possible . #% If they became aware that one of their fellow detainees was likely to crack under interrogation , they would have made efforts to kill him as well . #% That is why my group will abstain on some of the amendments of substance which would alter the substantive details of the Eurodac regulation . #% We are saying very clearly in the Joint Assembly that we want a strong and unequivocal dimension , which is a development dimension . #% Mr President , so far President Mahmoud Abbas , who is due to address us this Wednesday , has been a big disappointment as President of the Palestinian Authority . #% We needed to see how we could put in amendments to the proposals that Mr Byrne is going to bring out . #% I should like to ask you , Mr President , to give the Commissioner enough time to sum up properly at the end of the debate . #% We are fortunate in having a Scottish coastal forum to perform this role . #% This has been a very fruitful partnership all round and has allowed us to do the work reflected in this report . #% Likewise , the European Parliament has also been adept in using technical reports to bring about a harmonised European superstate . #% There have been many attempts , diversions and smoke-screens which have tried to suggest in some way that this was not the case . #% I wish to add my voice to the many comments that have already been made and say that I find it absolutely incomprehensible that we are even here in the first place , when we have perfectly good offices , meeting rooms and chambers in Brussels and that it is absurd that the whole `` Euro-circus '' has to come traipsing down to Strasbourg for three , possibly four days a month ( 5 days this week - I do apologise ) . #% Secondly , investment in the necessary infrastructure to deliver healthcare . #% We might still choose to push that with the Commission , but certainly ring-fencing is something that is agreed . #% It is right also not to allow the idea to persist that two or three countries speak for Europe , define its policies and drive them forward , while the views of the rest , many of which attach great importance to the transatlantic alliance , are portrayed as some sort of aberration . #% UK policy does not allow any financial inducements for egg donation . #% I would also particularly like him to confirm that he will be undertaking a full regulatory impact assessment of this wide-ranging proposal and that he has not excluded the possibility of meeting the undoubted requirements he has set out for improving the quality of consumer protection by means other than a directive . #% I have always had great respect , both political and personal , for you . #% 
Following the death of the Princess of Wales it should have been clear to us all that the present self-regulation we see in European countries is not working . #% Mr President , Commissioner Patten challenged us to justify to our electorate a demand for an increase in defence expenditure . #% I pay tribute to her patience and understanding on this issue . #% If it were proposed that money from the EGAF should be allocated to redundant workers in Britain , we would vote for it to be allocated and we would be criticised if we did not . #% Ironically I blame Mr Blair just as much for this because it was he who gave the green light to EU defence policy at St Malo in 1998 , and a month ago he compounded his error at Le Touquet . #% We should have requested it yesterday , but in view of the number of colleagues who have come to me , I wonder if we could now do that . #% We have made a good start with the hearing and after that vote tomorrow let the progressive forces in this House work with the Commission to deliver what the people of Europe want . #% If you can reform the European Union , Mr Blair , then I may even change my mind . #% ( The President urged the speaker to conclude ) Madam President , you allowed an extra 47 seconds for the last speaker . #% in writing . - The ECR Group firmly and consistently believes that decisions relating to social policy and employment law should not be made at EU level but at Member State level by national and local governments . #% We shall pay tax on the same basis as our constituents . #% About a 1960s-vintage public-sector accounting system that was in urgent need of reform , and yet the only action the Commission would take was to suspend one of the people who was brought in to carry out that reform . #% We must , in a very fast-moving world , take responsibility for our work but be prepared to modify it in accordance with what is going on in an entirely new world . #% Last year European Member States , as part of the UN , agreed a tracing instrument for small arms that was neither comprehensive -- covering guns , not bullets -- nor legally binding . #% It represents a spectacular assertion of narrow and misguided commercial interests over the greater prize of a development round itself . #% Overall , 2 033 species are in danger ; 86 % of the most threatened species are threatened because of the loss or deterioration of habitat due to factors such as dams , fishing , cattle numbers , etc. . #% However , Prime Minister Cameron was absolutely correct to ask for trade preferences to be granted to Pakistan . #% Apart from being morally wrong to abandon the social protection model that we have in Europe , it would be a huge mistake in practical terms . #% I personally have no brief or sympathy for the separatist cause , some of whose supporters , I am afraid , have links to al-Qaeda , but I urge the Chinese Government to think again . #% I am therefore asking the following questions . #% Whatever they may say , many Member States are looking for an escape route from the emissions trading scheme . #% I always believe that the approach we should take on environmental emissions directives must be proportionate . #% But the Statute is very generous to Commissioners . #% It is not obligatory to maintain Mr Le Pen 's immunity . #% That is why we feel able to support the compromise tomorrow . #% Their Amendment No 21 deletes the call for encouragement to the ethnic minority to take part in elections to vote or stand as candidates . #% But what is the contribution for Commission and publicly-funded research ? #% However , we should certainly question the credibility of the European Council in stimulating and managing the great debate about the social and economic future of Europe . #% We in the PSE Group are supporting the resolution and will be opposing the amendment from Mr Posselt , because it waters down the criticism of Mr Mugabe . #% Certainly , that seems to be the European Union 's view with regard to Belarus and Uzbekistan , so Tajikistan deserves to be treated in the same way . #% However , President al-Assad has only agreed to implement the terms of the Taif Accord of 1989 , which obliges Syria to redeploy its 14 000-strong army to the eastern Bekaa Valley , because he is buying time , and he has so far ignored the more comprehensive UN Security Council Resolution 1559 . #% In fact we thought that was a meaningless , formulaic human rights clause that makes a mockery of the aspirations of this House in that regard . #% Under opt-out , it is very easy to show that you have opted out and reputable senders have no interest in ignoring your request because they will just irritate you . #% She also emphasises the need for a strategy on the future of the agency 's relations with EU delegations . #% If we had known those facts when the amendments concerning it were tabled , my committee would have made them more forceful , not only cutting some of the Committee of the Regions ' budget , but putting a substantial additional amount into the reserve . #% Our job has been to look at the politics and the strategy . #% This is a complex text and the procedure for review has also been complex . #% It did not take it seriously in 1997 when it could have taken action to ensure a fair distribution . #% That seems to me the fair and equitable approach . #% That is why we are taking some time to consider what is the best way forward and to get the best synergy possible . #% We both therefore have an interest in reaching an understanding on the legislative programme coming up in any given year so as to plan our work , so as to exchange views on priorities , so as to reach agreement and convergence as much as possible . #% But I have been persuaded by the rapporteur and our esteemed shadow rapporteur not to table amendments on these defects because we are very keen to get these two directives on the statute book to modernise the framework for a unit trust and UCITS in the European Union . #% But the rapporteur has spoken about no exceptions and I am delighted to support him in that we have one single list . #% I congratulate the Commissioner himself and the presidency at the time - the Spanish presidency - for the way in which they conducted the business of the European Union there . #% Part of the issue here is that , in many cases , we find that toy manufacturers are faced with difficulties about getting some consistent standards against which to test , and I know that is something that you will address . #% They should also see that if there is a case for flexibility in the Stability Pact , then we do not need rigidity in the European Union budget by sticking at 1 % , as some Member States propose . #% Having worked in the automobile industry for nearly 30 years , I have tremendous sympathy with the workers in Genk and many other employees including those , in my own constituency , who are involved in restructuring of this kind . #% The first refers to the Interinstitutional Recruitment Office which we as a Parliament , and indeed as a Committee on Budgets , have been calling for for many months . #% One of the most stupid pieces of EU jargon that I have ever heard is ` unfair tax competition ' , which is what this clause is all about . #% That is why I tabled an amendment in committee about the location of this new authority , saying that `` in order to encourage respect for EU law , it should only be located in a country within the top half of Member States in terms of the fewest cases outstanding in the ECJ for alleged breaches of EU law '' . #% When I first heard of this report , I wondered how it would work logistically . #% Both paragraph 11 and our amendment in its original form mention the possible budgetary consequences of ` the ' increase in the number of agreements in the near future . #% Does the Council not feel it is time we started to try to harmonize night restrictions on aircraft flying across the European Union to achieve uniformity and to protect the health and quality of life of the people who live near these huge airports ? #% This Parliament has to be realistic , rational and forward-looking . #% Finally , the British Government be allowed to abandon the UK rebate for any short-term alternatives . #% We have to remember that Europe probably will need some large corporations if it is to reap the benefits of the Internet revolution . #% We have not done that with the amendments that we have made . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , this is a disease in respect of which farmers should make their own decisions , based on their own particular circumstances . #% Mr President , I want to add my congratulations to Mr Bayona de Perogordo and to thank Commissioner Vitorino for the attention they are drawing to the need for information . #% It is that choice which gives life to political debate at European level . #% At the institutional level , there is the possibility of quotation on the AIMS market in the UK , for example , and perhaps even the idea of using pension funds to allow for higher growth returns rather than with bonds and blue chip equities . #% In the Committee on Petitions and elsewhere , we are running into difficulties on this question : to whom does information belong ? #% In October one of the judges , Vianey Cruz , who was responsible for the illicit jailing of minors , was charged , and the director of the Humberto Dominguez Penal Centre , where drugs and alcohol and corruption have been found , was dismissed . #% Why is it so poor ? #% I commend the report to the House , but not all of the amendments . #% It is true that in this instance they have done more harm than good , as Mrs McKenna has said ; and it has to be said that there is a perfectly good case against this directive ; but we need to put in place a procedure , as a parliament , to guard ourselves in the future . #% 
In particular they want a fair crack of the whip . #% One conclusion comes immediately to my mind which I do not hear Mr Prodi addressing , and that is the implementation and enforcing of existing legislation . #% The proposal adopted by the Commission today concerning temporary agency workers is an important contribution in this respect . #% I would also like to ask the Commission whether it understands what it means to say we are going to have a great deal of new NGO activity in Burma . #% Both countries gained their independence from the Yugoslavian Federation and are now preparing to surrender their sovereignty to the European Union . #% In Eastern Europe , in South America , in the United States , aids are being given to encourage local investment . #% We must deplore these killings , and call on the Colombian Government to hunt these murderers down and see that they are punished . #% We have to face up to the realities of the global market . #% It was a solemn moment ; it was a special moment ; it was a potent moment . #% We look forward to seeing that detail and wish its progress well . #% It seems a little bizarre that whilst we are supposed to have equal representation and treatment for all EU citizens , in circumstances like the one I have described , there is unequal treatment and unequal representation for EU citizens . #% There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system . #% Mr President , the European Union is embarking upon one of its most historically important projects since its inception ; enlargement to eastern and central Europe , taking in the island of Cyprus . #% We must maintain humanitarian aid and continue the training of North Korean technicians in Europe if only to take this opportunity . #% Among other developments in Bulgaria there is now a new penal code , a new chief prosecutor , constitutional changes have been passed that allow the easier lifting of immunities , and the Judicial System Act is going through Parliament . #% Our markets have been destabilised and the taxpayer has had to fork out billions to compensate farmers for infected and suspected animals . #% However , it also dropped many key features : the notion of a ` Constitution ' ; the loss of the title and status of ` Foreign Minister ' ; the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be spelt out visibly in full in the treaty , and not be enforceable in British courts ; the removal of the symbols ( flag and anthem ) ; the abandonment of changes on legal terminology ( where ` regulations ' and ` directives ' would have been called ` laws ' and ` framework laws ' ) ; the postponement of and changes to the new voting weights in the Council ; and various derogations given to individual Member States , such as the UK . #% They are confused or refer to unspecified events not mentioned in the petition , or they try to undermine the argumentation of the report . #% Is it not rather dangerous to say that we will open negotiations in 12 months ' time ? #% The UK Deputy Prime Minister a hapless fellow if ever there was one is trying to foist regional governance upon our own electorate . #% In many ACP countries bananas grow in terrain unsuitable for other crops , so unemployment grows massively . #% We , and European farmers , wish him every success ! #% I should also like to express my personal appreciation of the work of Mr Söderman , the Ombudsman . #% Then we can judge it on its resolve and we can then give our verdict . #% As I speak , I know that Euronews - the television channel that seeks to give objective information about all European issues - is itself suffering very serious financial difficulties . #% We must realise and remember that whatever solutions we come up with must be acceptable to the peoples of the European Union and the applicant countries and will often have to be approved by referendum . #% However , access to the Internet is becoming increasingly important for civil participation , media pluralism , freedom of expression and interaction with government services . #% Rather , we are totally in favour of the type of intergovernmentalism represented by the Council of Europe and the Commonwealth , where independent nation-states freely co-operate on issues of common interest . #% We believe this is essential to the future because , of course , you can not really have a common foreign and security policy dedicated to crisis management and conflict prevention , while at the same time your big companies are arming the very countries responsible for instability . #% We have heard much from the Commission on the distortions in the internal market caused by bringing some sectors into the scope of the directive and leaving others out . #% On 28 August masked men kidnapped and severely beat his public defender , Surat Ikramov . #% The petitioners came to present their petition , explaining that , in some cases , they have had to pay fees and fines of up to EUR 45 000 to retrieve their property , after the Greek authorities had impounded and confiscated their vehicles . #% They should not be treated differently ; they should be given extra help . #% In many of our countries they are crucial to agricultural production and many major companies employ third-country nationals in senior executive posts . #% I was particularly amazed to read in the report that the number of herring taken by by-catch is greater than the quota itself . #% The principle of simplifying and modernising social security rules to make them more efficient and user-friendly certainly deserves support . #% I realized that in a very practical way this week : the television monitor in my office was not working when I arrived . #% It seemed sensible to accord similar status to all family members , if only to avoid the bizarre situations which sometimes occur when one family member can be accorded refugee status and another , on the same information , is denied it . #% They forget the 20 million people currently unemployed across our continent . #% Without that effort , we simply would not be in this situation now . #% It would also be a good idea to split the General Affairs Council from the Foreign Affairs Council . #% You will hear barracking from those who live on this European Union and who earn far more here than they would ever be worth in the commercial world . #% At the same time , I think we are all agreed that we do not want to see the sort of patent regime that appears to be running very fast in the United States and other countries , where patents for what we might call relatively trivial inventions covering business methods or simple software which ought to be covered by copyright will not be covered . #% Many of us were somewhat surprised by the number of amendments initially tabled on the proposal , but in many ways that simply reflects the importance and the seriousness of the nature of this proposal . #% I would also like to thank Mr Coelho for his assiduous and steady chairmanship . #% The confusion about the future of the African Union is very serious : it is underfunded , overstretched and finding it very difficult to operate . #% It is less about support to industries in the EU , and more about protecting them from outside competition in the real world . #% But there have been too many examples in the past of well-intentioned aid being left to rot because it was not suited to local conditions , or because there was not the wherewithal or the expertise to make use of it . #% It is claimed - perhaps justly - that this may be a breach of European Parliament Rules . #% And like everyone here in this Parliament , and all European journalists , I have been unable to go to Jaffna recently , nor have I seen any television coverage of the battle at Elephant Pass . #% Mr President , I should like to propose an oral amendment which takes the last part of this amendment - and the spirit of it - and says : ' ... points to the importance of the cease-fire declared by the PKK on 28 August 1998 and calls on the Turkish authorities to seize the opportunity thus created to seek a peaceful and negotiated political solution to the Kurdish question ' . #% Finally , the Commission has said that it may have to revisit some fundamental aspects of its earlier assumptions and approach . #% As Mrs Buitenweg said , we do not yet know how many staff will be engaged in this process . #% Equally there were concerns - and those concerns still remain in this House - that there was an attempt to claw back on access to documents , not least in the redefining of documents - the notion that whole files could be exempted - and attempting to redefine the notion of the third-party veto . #% I know this happens in the normal course of events but it can take up to a year . #% My preferred solution is to persuade them , but I am open to other solutions if we can find them . #% President Bush was understandably reluctant earlier in his presidency to become involved in the minutiae of negotiations which led nowhere and he wisely stood back . #% The core issues being discussed in this graveyard slot are the revisions to the 2001 aviation security rules , which are very much welcomed . #% As the European Union will continue to play a pivotal role along the road towards the next conference in Mexico , every effort has to be ensured to gain political acceptance at a global level . #% He was a man with daring methods but willing to build consensus . #% One of the important things which I would hope that the Commission will take away from our debate this evening is the way in which national administrations - I have talked about the British experience but , from comparing notes with other colleagues I understand it is just as bad in other countries - use Brussels and the European Commission as an excuse . #% There were two issues that the UK delegation could not support in this report : the call for search engines and Internet service providers to provide funding for the financing of content creation on the Internet and the call for a European Audiovisual Observatory to gather data on national public sector broadcasters . #% Starting first with the collection targets , my group doubts whether there is any point in pretending that many Member States can go further than the collection rate set out in the Council common position . #% Eighty per cent of voters have already registered and fifteen long-term observers are already in place . #% However , the Council of Ministers sometimes seems to have forgotten two important things . #% We must not vote for any delay on the implementation or indeed for a safeguard clause , which would limit the promise offered by EBA . #% 
This is absolutely astonishing and worrying and is a U-turn in British Government policy . #% However , it clearly did not take very long for the differences in salary and conditions between JET and the AEA staff to emerge , and unsurprisingly the latter wanted a better deal . #% I warmly welcome , therefore , the call for a much broader and better framework than there is at the moment . #% The fact that China has sought to interfere with an unofficial election taking place in another sovereign neighbouring state is an indication of its leaders ' contempt for democracy and their paranoia about Tibet . #% The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that . #% This proposal is part of the European Union 's wider response to the challenges described by Mr Levitt and , in particular , it deals with the problem of relatively new types of financial instruments , for example , derivatives and hedge funds . #% At present companies or researchers may commence with a clinical trial without an obligation to notify . #% The role of Parliament in relation to agencies is now a topic for discussion in the interinstitutional working group , and I am now a member of the European Parliament team on that - partly due to my experiences and a certain sense of frustration with the negotiations on the Asylum Support Office . #% I think that the proposed ambitious targets will ensure that a larger percentage of smaller WEEE will be collected in the future . #% We need to harmonise Turkey ' s legislation to the acquis and we need to work with Turkey to build a civil society . #% We should also give serious consideration to frontloading for next year in category 5 . #% If you buy your own services , meals , transport and so on , then you are in charge , you have a form of dignity and independence which too often is lacking in the relationship between state services and citizens . #% The Parliament , the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda . #% Let me finish with this : When war begins , politicians have failed . #% Mr President , today at 12 noon in London there was a strong protest outside the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food against the senseless culling of millions of healthy animals . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for that . #% We can see no place in the budget for that money ; we can see no likelihood of anything like the amount you promised to them being included in the budget . #% Now that there are increasing signs of reconciliation between Cyprus ' two communities , and on the eve of Cyprus ' membership of the European Union , this is a very good time to show evidence of that reconciliation by allowing the secondary schools to re-open in the enclaved Greek Cypriot communities . #% The problem is that investment in their development is not sufficient and such treatments are still several years away . #% These organisations have been backed and supported by the European Union and the Parliament over many years by grants voted by Parliament . #% I note conclusions 1 and 2 concerning the Standing Working Group on the safe transport of radioactive materials in the European Union , which was established in 1982 at Parliament 's request , which call for its work to continue and for its proceedings to be made public . #% And we should trust in the good faith of people in the political parties in the European Parliament . #% The European Union must play its role in unblocking this process of reform with considerable urgency . #% In terms of commitments I believe we have been very prudent in allowing significant margins in the various parts of the budget , well under the ceilings provided for in the IIA ; and for the first time since 2000 we are not requesting the flexibility instrument . #% The international community is facing a defining moment in its response to terrorism and we , as Europeans , will ultimately be judged by the way we treat our citizens . #% The reality is that if you do not have a job , you can not pay your bills or support yourself . #% Secondly , the number of animals slaughtered should reflect farmers ' claims for 6.5 million - not 10 million . #% I therefore support EU efforts to ensure that Europe - and the world as a whole - are ready to swat the millennium bug . #% The big issue that we have to face is online gambling . #% I believe this organisation needs comprehensive reorganisation into a properly democratic , accountable and transparent body . #% I should like to know , on behalf of this House , why the Council feels it has no obligation to reconsult us . #% Mr President , it is essential that the EU engages constructively with China as the most populated country on earth and -- in terms of certain purchasing parity measures -- as an economy that is due to overtake my country , the United Kingdom , and perhaps even Germany in the next two decades . #% Mr President , ever since this Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to endorse the European Constitution a month ago , some of those who were in the minority have sought to disrupt and discredit the position taken by the European Parliament . #% in writing . - We are in favour of robust international action to deal with piracy and have no doubt that the Royal Navy and allied navies from the US and other European nations will do a good job . #% Equally we are concerned at the insecurity of the indigenous peoples and their eviction from the land where they work . #% Mr President , the Treaties are the European Union ' s constitution . #% We come from five different political groups and from the non-attached Members , and yes , we are fighting this case at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg . #% The British arms industry already operates to some of the highest standards in the world and the British Defence Manufacturers ' Association has said that it warmly welcomes the principle behind the international arms trade treaty . #% After the scandals of Nick Leeson and Barings and in the last week of Mr Hamanaka and the Sumitomo Corporation we know that massive fraud and deception is happening today within these multinational financial institutions . #% In English we would say she is a human dynamo . #% Our partnership with Russia must therefore be strong and durable , but it can not be unconditional . #% Yet we understand that negotiations are in full swing for the construction of new buildings in Brussels , for which authorisation has been given neither politically nor in relation to the Committee on Budgets , since we have no documents available to us . #% You can not please all of the people all of the time , but that is not such a bad thing . #% I and my British Conservative colleagues have abstained on the resolution concerning the 4th World Conference on Women because we do not believe that it deals with the most vital issues appropriately or in a truly practical way . #% Good Europeans , like Britain , diligently liberalise their markets but bad Europeans , like France and Germany , have refused to do so . #% The consideration of these , engendered by human rights clauses in agreements , reports , urgency motions and other means in countries across the world is of great importance and , as I well know , is welcomed by democrats in those countries . #% Is anybody listening -- here , in this Chamber , or out there , in the real world ? #% There is a danger that some people , driven by financial necessity , might perhaps be persuaded to donate cells , either here within the European Union or perhaps in the developing world , for financial gain . #% It should surprise no one that the British coalition government is a prime mover in this , just as successive British Governments have been prime movers in most EU projects , while pretending to do the opposite . #% It is therefore vital that we get a message across today that human rights are not some add-on extra , they are an essential prerequisite of a modern economy . #% We keep hearing the Commission state that it will be repealing over-regulatory legislation and not proceeding with other damaging proposals . #% I appreciate that Mr Andria has moved on this and has compromised and added the facility for allowing the services to make proper investments , but we should not prescribe a non-profit status and compel the markets to adopt this model . #% We look for the perpetrators to be brought to justice , as well as those profiteering from the tragedy in the DRC . #% Part of the problem we have had in dealing with this is that a lot of the issues that have been raised have come from one particular direction of creativity : writing elements of computer programs . #% So , while my report maintains the Commission 's suggestion that only operators who place timber and timber products on the EU market for the first time should be required to put in place a full due-diligence system - since they are clearly the actors with the most influence - it makes clear that all operators in the market share responsibility for trading only legally sourced wood and that failing to do that may constitute an offence . #% But I want to turn my attention to the Pact for Stability and Growth . #% That most certainly is the intention of the Commission . #% In the meantime , we ask for the restoration of the United Nations mission working with the Haitian police , the disbandment of the so-called special brigades -- as suggested by the UN Special Envoy -- and the disarming of the militias . #% One of the difficulties with the Lisbon Agenda in particular is that Member States themselves promise to deliver but do not . #% Whilst we believe there are details to be added and changes which should be made , the broad thrust of the policy is correct . #% I want to take this opportunity to thank publicly the very hard-working UK staff of SOLVIT in the Department of Trade and Industry who have been extremely helpful to my staff in pursuing a very wide range of complaints . #% You can stuff yourself with baked beans until you die , but unlike alcohol or most pharmaceutical products , vitamin and food supplements do not have a track record of killing people . #% Mr President , this is one of the few times I have actually spoken on a topical or urgent matter in this House . #% That is why I would also like to congratulate -- in addition to the first co-rapporteur -- the other co-rapporteur , Mr Silva Peneda . #% I believe that the United Nations ' will is now to secure that goal . #% Last year there were 6 , 000 death sentences which is equivalent to the total for rest of the world . #% 
Madam President , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Olsson , on his excellent work in compiling this report . #% It is for that very reason that the people on the far right of this Parliament are so frightened when the political will of Europe speaks as it has done today . #% Refugees coming to the West who are terrorist sympathisers or have been active with the Taliban or al-Qa ` ida must be sent back to face the music . #% No politician is going to stand up here and say that he does not think safety is important , that is political suicide . #% The system was greatly improved in 1999 when the revised system was adopted by the Council : greater transparency , a greater guarantee that Parliament has access to all the proposals and all the documents . #% This is not a directive aimed at replacing the first pillar social security-type pension provision . #% However , if we can not speak in mother tongue languages in this Chamber , where it is known that we have an interest in the debate taking place , what kind of European Union do we have ? #% It is clear that the Lithuanian government has made enormous strides to catch up . #% It took numerous deaths in the United Kingdom , and one in particular , before our police services realised that they were institutionally racist and set out to change that . #% We are concerned at the new , high-profile role of the Council President and the proposed Foreign Minister and EU legal personality , which will enhance the perception that the EU is a state and will shortly be demanding membership of the UN Security Council . #% We have to follow the example given by Mr Patten in his remarks yesterday and make a clear resolution in favour of cooperation with Russia and on the question of Kaliningrad to fit in with the wishes of the people of that small territory . #% Its focus should be within the EU , but at the same time it should have a role in the formulation of our EU Association agreement . #% In response to the honourable Member 's third question , the Commission has instructed DG Press to formulate proposals that will ensure the proper availability of comprehensive information for citizens in the Union of 25 Member States . #% We are concerned , therefore , as others have said , at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society ' s most excluded , by aiming for a very narrow definition of `` refugee '' . #% Secondly , how can we be sure that we will get the information which we need ? #% The move to impose such a landlord model on United Kingdom ports will be enormously damaging . #% The report reminds us that in order to achieve significant improvement in global environmental protection measures and reduction of emissions , we need dialogue and consensus with both our trading competitors and developing countries alike . #% Mr President , I rise on behalf of all the authors to thank everybody in this Chamber who has signed this declaration . #% We are also looking for the sort of integrated projects involving the public and private sector that the Commission envisages in its proposal . #% There is growing appreciation within Belarus of the need for democracy ; hence the need for greater western contact with pro-democracy parliamentarians to avoid the risk of self-imposed isolationism . #% We would be foolish , as a Parliament , to rely on the Council ' s goodwill rather than on rights which we possess if the Commission has the implementing powers . #% There are issues relating to the liberalization of energy supplies and the deregulation of the regulatory framework as they apply to the industry , on which we can not completely reach agreement with the Christian Democrats . #% Can it envisage a mechanism through which best practices can be shared and encouraged ? #% The sums available of ECU 1bn are too small given the number of micro companies in the European Union . #% Alan 's career personally symbolises the outstanding reputation of the BBC for integrity and objectivity . #% We want a policy of prevention , of care , of enablement and of human rights . #% As history tells us , people will deny the possibility of failure right up to the last moment . #% We have supported this resolution with the clear aim of sending the message that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs will support all efforts to ensure we leave behind the bad old days of nuclear stand-offs and mutually assured destruction . #% Also , she makes important reference to previous decisions on increasing criminal penalties , and calls for the harmonising of criminal charges and penalties . #% We ought to look at how we release funds . #% Today 's decision gives the green light for the industrialized mixing and mutation of genes from unrelated species . #% Programmable devices are everywhere , in almost everything you can plug in or switch on , and your amendments interfere with them in apparatus and method terms , not just software . #% If you look at this PNR topic , the SWIFT scandal or CIA rendition , you see a pattern of a disunited Europe : Member States running round like headless chickens , subject to divide and rule by the United States . #% Neither has happened , to the ultimate shame of the European Commission . #% Cool too is the British Government and CBI view of another central proposal of the Commission document , to tackle the problem of late payments which so besmirches Europe 's and the UK 's business environment , propelling small firms into insolvency , because the Michael Heseltine view of the acceptability of stringing creditors along still prevails . #% Even last week , I was confronted by a very senior justice ministry official who thought that what we were trying to do was the equivalent of applying German law to determine liability in respect of a road-traffic accident which had happened in the UK , where , of course , we drive on the ` wrong ' side of the road . #% One is the development of illicit drugs , which are becoming increasingly difficult to detect . #% The Commission proposal is generally acceptable in principle but we feel we could go further in some areas by focusing particularly on those activities that pose the most significant risks : namely , activities using those organisms listed in Classes III and IV in the risk categories . #% in writing . - I supported Parliament 's decision to postpone granting discharge to the Council as I believe the Council has not provided Parliament with sufficient information regarding its accounts . #% Far from being a safeguard against violence , the presence of the Indonesian army has continued to be a cause of the problem . #% Through you , therefore , Mr President , I appeal to the British Government to prolong the funding of ` Operation Scrap-it ' to stop an environmental crisis in London . #% Mr President , I insist that we should not proceed with this urgency , because I have caught the Commission at some underhand behaviour , I am afraid . #% Because of the natural difficulties about the location of the matches under Euro 2000 , the PPE-ED Group as a whole has decided not to support this resolution and to withdraw it . #% So , codecision does not have to be slow , but it has to be thorough and it has to be built on absolute mutual respect for each of the parties involved in the negotiations . #% These types of reports are never easy and he has done a good job . #% If we fail on that , then we will have no success at all . #% As coordinator of the Socialist Group I should like to thank him for his help and advice over the time I have been coordinator , and for the quality of his work in committee . #% No doubt this is partly the result of developments in technology , but to maintain that making literature more expensive than it need be is in some way in the public interest frankly stretches my incredulity beyond breaking point . #% A general clause based on the requirement of fair commercial behaviour would seem better suited to this than the prohibition of misleading and deceptive practices , provided it is given a precise and workable definition . #% As Mrs Doyle mentioned , the UK House of Lords recently finalised a report on the effects of aviation on climate change . #% Out of a ton of straw you can create half a ton of paper pulp and a quarter of a ton of bioethanol . #% Yet non-payment of invoices presents a real problem to their manager , David Stear . #% He is right that I referred to the 10 000 jobs in the United Kingdom and specifically those in my constituency , Birmingham , Rugby and Stafford . #% The World Health Organisation has not been able to identify a threshold below which there are no effects . #% The new convention should also be asked to break the rigid relationship between the first , second and third parts and to create a proper hierarchy between them , so that in Part III the policies become distinctly subsidiary to Part I . #% Mr President , firstly , can I congratulate the rapporteur and the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries on his report on the revision of the regulations on the conservation of fishery resources and technical measures for the protection of juvenile marine organisms . #% Although the Community has no direct competence in the area of family policy , it has increasingly turned its attention to social and economic trends in society as they affect families . #% It remains to be seen what the implication of today 's vote will be in the Commission and Council . #% Liberalisation has directly resulted in enormous increases in the wholesale gas price in the UK . #% It is extraordinary that the sale of such dangerous WMD know-how to regimes as brutal as North Korea results in a presidential pardon and the right to keep the illegally acquired payments . #% The UK will in future be holding a referendum each time the EU proposes to remove power from its electorate . #% Small businesses need to be treated like domestic households and offered simple schemes and up-front money . #% I understood it quite well because I actually wrote it . #% I am encouraged by the growing confidence of ACP parliamentarians , and that has been demonstrated , as Mrs Flesch says , by the extensive participation now from both sides in the debates we are having . #% While I am not a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , I am one of the vice-chairmen of the Delegation for relations with the Peoples ' Republic of China and so take a considerable interest in what is happening there . #% We have three mediums in the United Kingdom already - cable , terrestrial digital - a powerful access for people to get onto the digital system - and satellite . #% 
Well , despite the strong arm tactics and bullying we managed to have a debate , which is a small victory for transparency . #% Mr President , I will begin by endorsing what my colleague Mr Fava has said . #% We have to remember that without a healthy environment we have no sound foundation for our economies . #% Governments have underlined the importance of leaving no stone unturned when justifying the intolerable suspension of civil liberties in the name of national security , rendering certain sections of our population subject to unrelenting , imbalanced scrutiny . #% Firstly , we have to ensure that political control remains with the Commission and Parliament . #% In my London constituency yesterday British police arrested eight British citizens of Pakistani descent with half a tonne of bomb-making material . #% Having only got what we consider minor concessions , we can confirm that , as British Conservatives , we neither support the Working Time Directive nor its extension to any other grouping . #% However , we have a core problem here : people who care about civil liberties - and here I include myself - are put on the spot about agreeing to measures of mutual recognition without having a comprehensive programme to raise the standard of observance of individual rights . #% Displaced refugees are suffering , starving to death , while the international political vacuum continues , only occasionally interspersed by fine words , but still no real action . #% It is unrealistic and it is one that he tried at first reading . #% The code of conduct will also provide a clearer framework for the rationalization of the European defence industry , which in turn will lead to the greater interdependence which will make national undercutting obsolete in the future . #% This point involves many issues such as corruption , which is widespread in Romania , involving administrative officials , judges , politicians and in its sum undermines the functioning application of the rule of law . #% It is a pleasure to have in the visitors ' gallery today Theodora Bertzi , the Minister for Adoptions , Alina Mandroiu , from the High-Level Group for Romanian Children , and Minister Bogdan Panait , who is in charge of child protection . #% Will we have to wait another decade for them to come back to this House to say the same things time and time again ? #% Like good brothers , we need a sensible and constructive way of talking to each other and so I warmly welcome the Commission 's communications and Parliament 's rapporteurs for the fine reports that they have written . #% The NGOs I consulted are part of the public record . #% I particularly commend those deleting sections relating to the consumer 's obligation to notify any fault within two months , because there is a clear problem of practicability here ; the renewal of guarantees for any goods supplied to replace faulty goods , because obviously the same conditions should apply ; and the removal of Article 3 ( 5 ) of the common position , which prevents the consumer having the contract of sale rescinded if a fault is minor , because a minor fault might be repeated time after time throughout the guarantee period . #% These abuses must cease and immediate steps must be taken to release those still in detention , commute any outstanding sentences of flogging and amputation , suspend executions and enable refugees to return home without fear of retribution for opposing the government . #% It has been suggested that the land eligibility rules should be disregarded for flax and hemp so that any land could be used for those crops , but without an increase in the base area . #% His forebears stood shoulder to shoulder with my forebears , fighting for democracy in those conflicts which have so disfigured this Europe of ours . #% One of the red herrings put around is whether to call the document a ` Constitutional Treaty ' or a ` constitution ' , but , as the authors say , this is a sterile debate . #% My question is whether you really needed any more powers . #% Finally , we in Europe are making the long-term problem worse because of our failure to take strong enough action on climate change . #% It will damage the internal market if this state of affairs is allowed to continue ; it will damage the credibility of the Commission and it will further damage British farmers . #% The 3a committee procedure proposed is certainly not an example of either openness or democracy . #% They did not , in general , relate to matters concerned with the Internet - this new technology , which has come in at an enormous pace in the last few years ; a new technology which has the ability to do good things but also the ability to do evil things . #% Food hygiene is something which affects European citizens ' daily lives and a topic in which many people have great interest . #% Saddam modelled his total control on Stalin , whom he emulated . #% It is quite true that there are many reputable agencies which pay well , which engage in training their staff and which provide very good terms and conditions . #% The report itself is well-intentioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability . #% Therefore , in my view , President-in-Office , the ACP countries were misled into believing that they should feel secure about future funding under the tenth EDF . #% In the light of the Commission document ` Time to move up a gear ' , launched in January , this is certainly not a time for drivers to now run out of fuel . #% In the end the whole of European society would face the consequences . #% Why therefore can not that message be put across with greater alacrity and greater effectiveness , by the Commission in particular ? #% We argued during the GATT talks that our policies were helping the economies of poorer rural areas , not supporting production . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking all colleagues who have been involved in this over the last five years and the Commission and the Council for their work on this implementing regulation . #% If this legislation were to be implemented , the problems would be exacerbated . #% Therefore , shared management is something we think is important to have implementation of the IIA provision . #% Within the last week we have seen two good illustrations of the way in which industry is responding to it professionally and effectively . #% Only by putting in the funding to enable the democratic process to get off the ground can we hope to start to see some progress . #% We believe that there should be protection , which we tried to set out in Amendment No 13 , against this kind of thing which takes a free ride on an established product . #% Because he promised us back in June -- did he not ? -- that he would report back to the European Parliament as often as he could . #% However , in the current circumstances of the car industry , given that cars are not being sold , it was quite clear in the discussions we had with the Council that , in fact , 12 months was probably unrealistic , and we had to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tyres that are perfectly good and sound . #% I and the members of the Environment Committee feel that this is grossly inadequate and that if it is not a directive there will in fact be no impulsion on the Member States which are currently lagging behind to do anything at all . #% What strikes me most in these two budgets is the emergence of interinstitutional cooperation , which ten years ago was perhaps more of a wish than a practice . #% Like everyone else in this House , I hope and expect that the sow stalls proposal will go through on Thursday . #% Those of us who enjoy the most basic freedoms of free speech and free assembly and democratic politics have a duty to speak out on behalf of Mr Liu and those like him . #% We can only deal with this matter if we deal with it in an international fashion . #% I do not believe we should allow junior doctors to be able to practice medicine . #% However , when it comes to price capping , I still have some concerns . #% It would be all too easy for this to happen unless we ensure that the balance of forces is not allowed to shift to favour employers over employees . #% Such silence hands the rule of law to thugs and to those who can feel powerful only by creating a culture of fear . #% We do not do so because we want to alter the pressure on all sides to achieve reconciliation on the island of Cyprus . #% I would like to pick up on the Commissioner 's last reply and I am delighted that he is talking about thorough impact assessment . #% I await a comparable announcement from the Commission or , indeed , from President Barroso . #% While the report makes some valuable points on protecting the interests of our agricultural industry , e.g. the need to protect geographical indications within bilateral and multilateral agreements , I am of the opinion that the report includes parts which are too protectionist and which set unrealistic conditions on current and future EU negotiations on trade agreements . #% Also , on the question of the provisional adoption of a text pending the legislative procedure , this is important in certain circumstances in order to avoid a legal vacuum . #% However , I fear that watchdogs often lose sight of the wood for the trees , and there needs to be more concentration on the really serious , suspicious transactions and breaking the criminal and terrorist financing networks . #% That means free movement through the Channel Tunnel . #% In exchange , we have taken the right to have the final say within those ceilings and within a margin of manoeuvre on every item of expenditure -- what was previously obligatory and non-obligatory . #% This as well , of course , as deploring the suicide bombing and the 140 victims and 500 injured last week . #% Finally on foreign policy , where the US seems to wish to continue its ideas for action against Iraq , this is seen by many as not perhaps the best way to deal with that problem . #% We are seeing the same sort of relocation through India , Sri Lanka , Latin America and China - where , we are told , the future of textile manufacturing lies . #% That target date coincides with the end of our term as Parliamentarians and Commissioners . #% A constant turnover is problematic on many levels and we have to remember that we are human beings , not cogs in an economic wheel . #% Berlin and Brussels can not be breached . #% 
As I have said many times in this Chamber , under the European Arrest Warrant , extradition - or rather judicial surrender , to use the correct term - is now merely a bureaucratic formality . #% Will this in future form part of Community law , whose application and uniformity we should be looking out for ? #% Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group . #% I represent Teesport in the north-east of England , which is one of the busiest ports in Europe and serves a massive chemical industrial complex . #% Some of us decided not to accept this proposal and made our way to the check-in desk for the original flight , which was then closed . #% May I say again that I welcome your remarks about there being no such thing as a single European social model . #% We hope that in time the Commission will fall into line with most of this House and the Council in understanding that there is a need for a longer-term review . #% Furthermore , separate agreements have been reached in the maritime and aviation sectors . #% It was a pleasure to watch her . #% However , I also believe that some increases were not justified and therefore I took the decision to abstain . #% To move to the business of the sitting , I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for her work on this report and for the moves that she has been prepared to make in terms of a general solution to what may be a general problem , which is , after all , part of what the Regulation is supposed to do . #% The report makes the point that far from the model being a burden or a millstone , social policy should be seen as a positive factor in the European Union 's economic growth , not only by increasing productivity and competitiveness but also by generating social cohesion , raising living standards for citizens and ensuring access to fundamental rights and freedoms . #% This is not like counterfeit products , as another speaker tried to suggest . #% Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored . #% We often deal with proposals that come from the European Commission which do not have proper impact assessments attached to them . #% We need industrialised countries to make legally binding their commitments to give special and differential treatment to poorer countries . #% The initial analysis is basically good but the proposals for action are often little more than a description of an issue . #% Lastly , it is important in the context of the politics of this kind of debate not to have a knee-jerk reaction to any particular pollution incident in the recent past . #% I therefore abstained on the resolution . #% However , I feel that Member States were not sufficiently committed to the extension of worker consultation and indeed , in some Member States , the results will be regressive . #% This resolution reminds the people of Europe that Sunday has a special place . #% The decision of French and Dutch voters is extremely clear : France and Holland did not vote for a slightly different Constitution , they voted against the Constitution in its entirety . #% Those things which we call politics , which we call foreign affairs , respond to underlying trends . #% The Council has been left in no doubt as to the strength of feeling in this House about the internment without due process of Guantanamo Bay prisoners . #% I think that cooperation and solidarity across the European Union is , of course , important when discussing the burdens that nations face but we must better distinguish economic migrants from asylum seekers . #% This morning I want to acknowledge that there are some serious comments in it but equally acknowledge what the Commissioner has said , namely that we have to distinguish between the auditing responsibility and the policies that sometimes give rise to the criticism . #% We can legislate against discrimination in the workplace , but we can not legislate against the pressures of juggling work , family life and managing a home . #% Mr President , the drafting of the Charter has now reached a critical phase . #% I also think that the Commission really ought to look back at the evaluation of that third-sector initiative . #% Mr President , I am sure I am the only Member of this Parliament who was once an officer in the armed forces of Sierra Leone . #% If they chose to stay at home and bring up their family , they must not be undervalued . #% If the Commission truly feels that retailers are making too high a margin on shoes , then it should launch an investigation into the competitiveness of the shoe industry , not punish retailers and the supply chain by using the blunt instrument of anti-dumping duties . #% An additional , optional , European cross-border justice system , which may emerge from the European payment order proposal , could bring less certainty and more confusion . #% We believe that the provisions of Article 3 ( a ) set a limit to what that comparative advertising might be and we also support the rapporteur in her proposal to delete Article 3 ( a ) 1 ( g ) because , although we understand the lobby which constantly emerges where particular stimulating agricultural products are concerned , there is enough protection already in the directive without that suggestion . #% I would ask him to be so good as to reply in English saying what can be done , so that I can send this reply to my constituent in the West Midlands . #% We should never lose sight of how far the economic developments in this sector have very little political accountability or control contained within them . #% It seems to me that we must steel ourselves to take firmer action in this regard . #% It is important , too , that we in Parliament and in the institutions of the European Union also apply modern methods , methods characterised by transparency and openness , in our own deliberations . #% It is certain that the quality and pace of reform in Turkey will be driven by the developing relationship with the European Union . #% This will be essential for a Union of the future . #% In Amendment No 17 we call on the Member States to work together and with the Commission on binding legislation by the end of this year , and certainly no later than 1999 . #% That issue is Iran . #% We welcome the summit 's agreement to the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society , an important contribution to the global effort needed to bridge what is known as the digital divide . #% However , he is fundamentally wrong when he says this debate is not about China . #% These are not burdens . #% I have said before , if the EU is the answer it must have been a silly question : that much you can communicate ! #% This Convention is much more reminiscent of the American nation-building exercise in Philadelphia in 1787 . #% As Mr Winkler says , Europe can offer leadership in this debate , demonstrating the effectiveness of our code of conduct on arms sales . #% Developing countries are preparing for Seattle , and preparing to be very busy . #% But what the Connecticut Yankee did understand - I quote from the motion for a resolution - ' takes the view that the convergence of telecommunications media and information technology sectors must be reflected in European rule-making in such a way that inter-operability of various technologies is not hampered ' . #% We take out millions of tonnes of sand eels and scour the sea beds , and the cod eat sand eels . #% Asylum-seekers are not a burden but a responsibility . #% This image certainly does not include the overwhelming majority of third-country nationals , who contribute enormously to the economy and society of the European Union and have proved this over a number of years . #% On health care , the population is virtually at the lowest ebb . #% Mr President , I greatly support the reforms which will provide for a fair , buoyant and transparent system of public funding of political parties , something which , regrettably , does not exist in Great Britain at present . #% In a very difficult international situation and in spite of terrorist atrocities in Istanbul , there has been a firm commitment to domestic change . #% Uganda has made many great strides in the past two decades and , in some ways , can be seen as a model for Africa 's development . #% In the long-term , I am convinced that , while the cart is in front of the horse - and that is the Commission exercising greater policy-making influence than the elected Members of this Parliament - throughout Europe people will remain apathetic toward this institution . #% The issue of the Eurodac Convention highlights the way in which legitimate concerns and national security can sometimes conflict with human rights and civil liberties . #% Mrs Boumediene-Thiery 's report points out - and I congratulate her for its quality - that facilitating mobility promotes dynamism and economic competitiveness . #% That is the sound of silence that heralds the clamour for this piece of legislation . #% The success of Alexander Lebed , which has already been referred to , in the presidential elections last summer where he came third , with 11 million votes , was an indication of this political trend . #% Finally , two factual corrections ; firstly , our Amendment No 6 makes it clear , when we are calling for the plant not to be reopened until an investigation has taken place , that we are talking about the conversion plant and not the reprocessing plant in Tokaimura , which is a separate plant on a separate site operated by a separate company ... #% We have to deal with the real and imagined threats . #% Would the President-in-Office see whether such a code of practice could be agreed between Member States for any such future incidents ? #% The French said ` no ' and the Dutch said ` no ' , but you refused to accept these democratic results and you took part , with many Members of this Parliament , in the absolute deceit that is the Lisbon Treaty . #% 
Mr President , my point of order is quite clear . #% On the funding question , the USD 4.5 billion pledged at Tokyo in January , including over USD 1 billion from the European Union , has , for the most part , been slow to arrive - although I note the Commissioner 's remarks about the way the Commission has responded . #% If there is a problem in agreeing on benchmarks and this is an indication of disaccord in bilateral discussions , the Commission should be very much involved in helping to reach an agreement on these benchmarks in a way that will lead us out of this impasse . #% I am also pleased that future EMI reports will contain more detailed analyses and evaluations of the effect of the exchange-rate fluctuations on the economy . #% They feel aggrieved that their ambitions for EU membership in the long term are being ignored and decreed unrealistic , particularly by the Commission . #% I also share Mrs Smet 's concerns over enlargement , the , the application of the -- particularly in the area of occupational safety and health , the development of social dialogue , open coordination in the European Union as it will be this time next year . #% This is pay-as-you-go citizenship . #% Certainly , that has been one of the achievements of the Fiscalis programme . #% How much more important it must be in those countries which , as has been said , have a so much lower standard of living . #% Mr President , amid the tragedy there is one encouraging sign . #% We will support this report . #% So the Commissioner is absolutely right to point this out not only to the USA but also to other third countries . #% It must also be emphasised that Israel took great care during the operation in Gaza to provide medical and humanitarian support for all the casualties , as well as innocent Palestinian civilians . #% Well , I thought orientation took place before you started on the journey , but apparently the journey has been interrupted while we work out where we are trying to go . #% I hope the Commission has heard what we say . #% Having to produce an interim report as a matter of form is something of a distraction , although of course we like to keep our colleagues informed as to where we are . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , whilst food prices are undoubtedly rising , the situation at the farm gate is very different . #% Allowing for the fact Britain 's contributions are just below 15 % of the total budget , any new project for which Britain receives less than a third of the benefits leaves Britain out of pocket . #% I would be happy to furnish the Commissioner with further details from the trade union groups and civil societies in El Salvador . #% This was , of course , refused even though it admitted there was no research evidence on the safety of child use of mobiles and there was some data for adult brain damage in the prolonged use of mobile telephones . #% Thirdly , many have spoken about the need for a balanced approach . #% So we are calling for the deletion of paragraphs 2 and 6 . #% Part of our job as the rapporteur team has been to consult staff and executives in other institutions to make sure their needs are fully catered for . #% It is right that we should try and get the European Council to focus on strategy and on the key strategic issues and no longer be a court of appeal when the ordinary Council is deadlocked . #% This is why I have tabled an amendment which has been agreed in the Employment Committee , to seek the publication by the Commission of guidance to accompany the directive to ensure the smooth and uniform transposition of this directive into law in all Member States . #% They are asking for compliance with the commitments which were made under the Uruguay Round . #% If such a confidence-building measure also speeds the end of the illegal French ban on British beef , then so much the better . #% A motor vehicle accident in any circumstances can be traumatic , all the more so if it involves personal injuries . #% It is quite wrong that Members of this House behave in that disgusting manner towards people who have just lost their jobs . #% We saw similar scenes in my home country , the United Kingdom , last year when Excel Airways went bankrupt , leaving over 200 000 people out of pocket , without compensation and stranded at a whole host of airports throughout Europe , with it costing them even more money to find accommodation and flights home . #% This came out of the Emerge project , which was funded by the Fifth Framework Programme , and I should emphasise that much of the technology is here now and some cars already have it . #% Nevertheless this is not the ideal way of working and I would like to register that point . #% We can also stimulate Union-wide debate on the family by encouraging the Member States to share information and pool their experiences whilst at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity . #% Mr President , I welcome Marco Polo in principle and in practice . #% Is the Council therefore incompetent ? #% President Cox and our representatives , Mr Brok and Mr Hänsch , must carry on playing a full part in the negotiations and resist any weakening of Parliament 's powers of codecision and assent . #% The francophone connection is only one of many which we have between the members of the European Union and the rest of the Middle East . #% That was , as the Commissioner 's statement says , `` immensely heartening '' . #% And yet we have this anomaly which I do not believe occurs in other Member States . #% I am concerned that the science behind this proposal is incomplete . #% What are these guidelines ? #% I am sure that Neil Kinnock is precisely the right person to help restore public confidence in the EU institutions and their actions . #% While Commissioner Patten spoke about the Barcelona process -- a highly desirable process established a long time before the Americans ' idea of a greater Middle East process -- that process is not having the sort of effect that it should have . #% Well , maybe because in implementing such a programme the EU can exploit yet another area where its message can be delivered to folk who will not believe or contemplate that they are being manipulated . #% Madam President , I thank the rapporteur and the Commission for bringing forward this important report , dealing as it does in a sound way with significant matters . #% We profoundly regret the circumstances in which he had to return home . #% I remember visiting Lithuania a few weeks after independence . #% This report sets national targets for ozone levels and proposes action plans for dealing with local problems of exceedance . #% It is a good start and there is much more to do . #% We do not need any new great raft of social legislation , but there are areas that have not been addressed . #% If there is a way in which you can alert those on the premises of Parliament to that fact that there is a vote and adjourn until they are present , maybe we will get a more representative result . #% We will exploit that freedom . #% I note and welcome in paragraph 5 the view that no new post ought to be created in 1999 , and I hope that , as we progress into the budgetary procedure , the caveat expressed there is one that can be dropped . #% We must also take urgent practical steps : an immediate ban on imports of wild birds into the EU , and improved bio-security , particularly in the international poultry industry . #% I now embark upon an exercise in Dutch-English cooperation . #% Clinics can give donors compensation of GBP 15 -- about EUR 20 -- plus expenses for donations . #% ` If the Commission is not in a position to make such a statement at the end of Parliament 's vote on its proposal , it shall inform the President or the committee responsible as to when it will be in a position to do so ; the proposal shall then be placed on the draft agenda of the first part-session thereafter . ' #% The UK invented railways , developed them and was the first to privatise them . #% However , we are insistent that housing and housing policy be subject to the principle of subsidiarity and that therefore such issues are , and must remain , an exclusive competence of the nation states . #% Russia must also take concrete steps to protect human rights and the rule of law , given the number of unsolved murders of journalists and human rights activists . #% We support the Swoboda report and the sensible amendments tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy . #% The fundamental priority must be for governments to implement macro-economic strategies that integrate trade in a way that effectively supports poverty reduction . #% I also support the idea that we should demonstrate our own responsibility - a concept which is foreign to the Greens - by introducing a marketing ban as tests are developed where at present there are no alternatives available , even though we then have to set a deadline for these tests , perhaps ten years ahead . #% So far as the NATO statement of last month on plutonium is concerned , I am not in a position to give a comprehensive answer at this stage . #% That will be very welcome . #% Does the committee understand that a whole range of professional equipment is involved here ? #% 
We will now have interinstitutional negotiations and the resolution we will adopt will serve as a mandate to our negotiators . #% Already LTTE delegations to EU Member States will not be received . #% Personally I have strong doubts about the call for the harmonization of VAT on newspapers and periodicals across Europe . #% Part of the Daphne report contains information about the European campaign to raise awareness of the issue of violence against women , and this was launched in Cologne under the German presidency last month . #% I have seen no evidence at all at this stage of anything more than error on the part of the Patent Office . #% Similarly , the comments from Commissioner Prodi back in July saying that the intention was to simplify regulation by at least 25 % , and to do that with all speed , is also to be welcomed . #% Today , in supporting this important resolution , we call upon the Council and the Commission to speak for Parliament in asking the Egyptian Government to think again . #% Mr Medina referred to this . #% Many pressure groups working in this field will contend that their priorities have not yet been properly addressed at all , let alone evaluated . #% Today we are not merely discussing the collapse of emerging markets . #% However , let us return to the original text , which many people tried with great goodwill to modify because there was perceived to be a nuance in terms of the original text being too strong . #% First of all , for Mr Fabre-Aubrespy to say the debate was not conducted properly is , I think , offensive in the extreme to the chairmanship of Mrs Theato in the committee and to your predecessor in the chair in this House . #% We must also look at using market-based mechanisms , such as tradeable emission permits . #% As rapporteur for a very good Commission communication on aviation and environment I know that the issue of environment and competitiveness is a very live one with strong feelings on both sides of the debate . #% Have any Member State competent bodies contradicted it ? #% The Commission continues to hold that view on the basis of the evidence that , in the marine environment , the only exposure pathway is the slow dissolution of uranium . #% I rise , therefore , to question whether Rule 139 ( 1 ) of our Rules of Procedure is being applied correctly . #% On behalf of the committee and personally I want to ask Commissioner Bangemann where the Commission now stands on this proposal ? #% As the Commission 's communication said , the justice and home affairs dimension is now firmly identified as one of the Union 's priority policies . #% The Danish Presidency has worked very hard to agree these amendments with us , and this would allow us to close the dossier at second reading without going into conciliation . #% Just whose side is Tony 's crony on ? #% I am pleased also that trafficking in human beings has been fairly high on the EU agenda , but pressure must be put on those Member States that have not already done so to sign up to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings . #% The first is the importance of our research programme and spreading that research programme out to the less-developed world . #% I thank Mr Coveney . #% Indeed , I hope that it will not just remain a pilot project which will come to an end at the end of this year , but will be the basis of a comprehensive system of satellite tracking , applied eventually over a much wider area , including the Mediterranean , where Community vessels are subject to quotas and controls . #% We still have enormous problems with adequate recognition of qualifications , particularly vocational qualifications . #% That is a minimum requirement : to try to reach the target of noise reduction of , at best , -14 dBA , but at the very least , -10 dBA reduction at source . #% Mr President , going back to the same question regarding the possible use of depleted uranium in Serbia and Kosovo , a specific question was asked to go on the agenda of Question Time , a specific question , not a general point as we had yesterday from the President-in-Office of the Council . #% Given that at most only 35 % of consumers actually roam and that the figure for regular roamers is much lower and , as the Commissioner herself admitted , given that this legislation will mostly benefit a narrow group of privileged consumers such as Commission officials , MEPs , lobbyists and businessmen , let us hope that we are not robbing the poor to pay for cheaper phone calls for the rich . #% Is it something for which there is a consumer demand ? #% I was not expecting to speak but , as you have asked me , I will do so . #% . -- Mr President , my group has serious concerns about human rights in China . #% I think the Services Directive has perhaps been the best example of that . #% The Tories , on the other hand , offer nothing but rising crime and falling investment . #% This unfortunately was rejected by both the Council and the Commission . #% Although the subject matter is justice and home affairs , where there is normally some parliamentary input , external agreements are negotiated without parliamentary scrutiny . #% We need to have him here when we attempt to reach some conclusion on it . #% Sweden has a close relationship with the USA in terms of intelligence sharing and cooperation , calling into question Sweden 's perceived neutrality . #% That , of course , has made the whole debate briefer because it is not interrogatory . #% There are many areas of agreement with Russia , which all said and done is our strategic partner . #% Events have obviously moved on since then . #% I hope through you , Mr President , and through our French colleagues here , we can send this message back to President Chirac and the French authorities . #% The demographic time-bomb is ticking , as more people become unproductive too soon . #% The well-meaning EU , if it chooses ` Opt In ' , will do two harmful things : it will handicap EU-based businesses against their worldwide competitors , and it will transfer jobs outside the EU . #% We are calling for an Authority that has a clear and targeted remit to examine issues of food safety and is founded on the principles of transparency and meritocracy . #% I have to say that I can not think of anything more reasonable or pragmatic or sensible than the amendment which a number of colleagues have supported me in submitting . #% This fuel spillage has resulted from inadequately fitted fuel filler caps , and the directive that we are now putting before you , with Parliament ' s amendments at second reading designed to tighten up those provisions , addresses this question by requiring motor vehicle fuel tanks to have positive closure mechanisms so that the cap is always securely closed . #% My final point is that the head office of the trade union , KFAT , is in Leicester , my home town . #% Reopening the debate on this issue will clearly be counterproductive to the whole process of the Single European Sky . #% Finally , it is vital that we accept the committee 's amendments on execution-only business . #% It is much better , in my view , to focus on a different paragraph in our resolution : the need for an international force in Palestine . #% As chairman of the Committee on Budgets , I would dearly love to know the cost of that temporary committee for an outcome that had nothing at the end of it . #% They make certain that their computerised systems respect quality . #% The fresh approach we take is to include such matters as social rights , ecological rights and cultural rights , and to regard these as fundamental human rights too . #% Is it really enough to send blankets and bandages after facilitating the supply of arms that caused the injuries in the first place ? #% It can all be resolved in due course . #% If the EU has anything to offer , it should be a single-minded condemnation of terrorism , together with humanitarian and reconstruction assistance . #% Government campaigns should warn everybody . #% The President-in-Office mentioned it in his speech . #% I agree with that even more strongly now than I did then . #% It seems clear to me that this proposal has a criminal base only , through the use of Article 82 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU . #% Thank you , Commissioner and I certainly agree with the substance , particularly of the early part of your answer . #% Together we can work for the future of the European Union . #% We have the clear recognition now of the precautionary principle itself . #% The remarks by Mr Oostlander give cause for some alarm , because if we go down the avenue of saying that there must be a clear concept of what a family is then we are undermining the whole process . #% This same public , though , is concerned about climate change . #% 
Great challenges are ahead . #% In fact , you are going to meet lots of Communists over the next six months , including the boss of the Commission here , old Barroso who was an advocate of Chairman Mao ! #% We would like to see some consistency . #% The proposal has now reached its second reading . #% Greek Presidency #% Madam President , it was clear on Monday that there was going to be chaos today . #% If that turns out to be the case , as I am sure it will , the whole of the transport system , and indeed the economies and societies of the European Union , will benefit greatly . #% These people need our support because they identify with our values of freedom , democracy and the rule of law . #% Mr President , the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant has , of course , been widely applauded by Members in political groups in this House , but it could have happened earlier and the reasons why it did not are instructive . #% The Convention should look at this issue so that it can be discussed as openly as possible and with full consultation of all the interested parties . #% Walls , weapons and iron curtains are not the answer to asylum-seekers and refugees . #% Mr President , the process of enlargement is one that we all broadly welcome . #% Of course , the victims , arguably , are prepared to take drastic risks to enter the countries of the European Union . #% Better still , cancel the whole project and put all the funds into a special account to help defray the enormous costs that will be incurred when the euro is eventually dismantled . #% Could you be specific about the additional support which will be needed if an entire farming community is to be able to survive the loss of its livelihood which , for many of those we represent , is now the case . #% The fundamental principles of the Union are freedom , respect for democracy , human rights , and if you remove freedom of movement , if you stigmatise people because they have applied for a visa or they hold a particular type of visa , I believe you undermine the fundamental principles of the Union . #% Bringing that legislation into the WTO negotiations is vitally important , as is clear labelling . #% This is a bad precedent . #% The NGOs and MEPs could , indeed would , suggest a far clearer approach - a more user-friendly set of guidelines - which would therefore be far more relevant and effective in meeting the objectives . #% We recognize that the present directive needs reform in the light of technical progress and experience gained in the last few years . #% We managed to reach an agreement and , interestingly , in no small way was that due to the determination of the Swedish Presidency at the time . #% That is why our Group believes that before we rush headlong into yet more trade rounds in Seattle we first need a comprehensive impact assessment of the social and environmental effects of the liberalisation that has already taken place as a result of the last Uruguay Round of trade negotiations . #% We need to modernise and strengthen that legislation , not in order to stop globalisation or the deepening of the internal market - of course not - but in order to make sure that we manage the changes these things bring , through a spirit of partnership in all of our workplaces , large and small , within the European Union . #% She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House , there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full , formally and in detail for everything I have done . #% There were rumours that Chinese security advisors were to be installed in the Chief Executive 's office . #% While the bureaucrats and the politicians argue , farmers and their families in Britain suffer . #% This is essential , just as it is for any national police force . #% We ensured food aid could no longer be used as a system to mask continuing export subsidies , and the EU 's ` Everything but Arms ' initiative was supported by all . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would say to the Commissioner that it is clear we are dealing with a system which is broken . #% The problem is that delay means cost , and one of our objectives was to ensure that we only accepted a fair share of the costs . #% I have been trying for a number of years , without much success . #% Our failure to agree tyre safety standards creates an unacceptable level of uncertainty with regard to this vital question . #% Fourthly , we have some important guarantees as regards openness and transparency , and we have acceptance of Parliament 's idea that a market participants ' committee should be set up alongside the other committees . #% Secondly , as we know , it damages the health of athletes . #% For example , recent research suggests that an increase rather than a decrease in nephrops quotas could actually be positive for the regeneration of cod stocks . #% We will see problems arising in the future with Category 5 . #% These scams hop from country to country , taking advantage of our divergent legal systems to escape justice . #% We have the communication from the Commission on complaints and petitions , and we now have Mr Liikanen 's proposals . #% Mr President , the Lisbon Strategy is so full of grand ideas that we often hear very little -- and indeed we have heard very little today -- about the simple things , such as improving the quality of our own legislation . #% It is important to come back to the increased longevity of the citizens of the European Union . #% Several of the amendments in this report would help the Union move towards more responsible fishing agreements . #% Only in this way can we do what we are supposed to do , and restore the public confidence that Mrs Schreyer spoke about this morning . #% The text is overambitious , and Britain ' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the `` Amsterdam left-overs '' in order to prepare for enlargement , and not expand far beyond these . #% I pulled out here , and in my explanatory statement , five or six specific projects : the Solvit network , which provides a mechanism for people who come up against barriers to the internal market to raise the issue with the Member State concerned ; the Euphin programme , which enables authorities to exchange data on public health issues , including communicable diseases in a fast and secure way ; Ploteus , a portal that supplies information on learning opportunities around Europe ; TourNet , a system for linking tourism administrations so that they can share information about their own particular areas ; and finally Transcards , a more local and focused programme , which allows citizens living on the French-Belgian border to use the health facilities of either Member State , regardless of which country they live in . #% The Commission was already in serious trouble and its problems were bound to have been compounded by the Bangemann decision . #% Mr President , like many here I welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done so far . #% Whilst we do n't label very low levels of residues of pesticides or chemical contaminates in foodstuffs , we know they are present . #% It prevents real aid going to real people on the ground who need access to contraception , family planning and other health services . #% There was no actual breach of safety , only a breach of record-keeping regulations for one particular customer . #% It is bad enough to see the Council trying to take unilateral action on an adjustment of the financial perspective from 2004 to 2006 , but to see the inclusion of a guaranteed ceiling on agricultural expenditure up to the year 2013 is totally unacceptable . #% Fishing in that part of the world relies totally on partnerships and agreements . #% To extend it to groups such as offshore oil workers and sea fishermen is particularly so . #% I therefore welcome the Commission 's infringement action against some of the Member States which have not properly implemented the waste oils directive . #% I note that Mr Hughes maintains otherwise ; not for the first time his own government disagrees with him . #% We believe that , at this stage of international development , Europe needs to show that it is not only capable of acting on the world stage and assisting with humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Iraq , but can also put a figure for this item in its budget . #% It is now up to Europe 's political leadership to set the terms and determine the nature , breadth , substance and intensity of this debate . #% Nevertheless , we have dealt with this matter so extensively that we will probably not gain anything by extending the process to the full beauties of late-night conciliation in Brussels . #% What growth ? #% I welcome the condemnation which was issued by the Turkish ambassador in Washington but it is a matter of words , words , words . #% He said that there is an urgent need to focus activities on core tasks and that additional staff needs will be concentrated in the area of project and programme implementation , in particular within delegations . #% This takes us well beyond the simple checking of people against watch lists , for which APIS data -- i.e. name , date of birth , nationality and passport number -- is quite sufficient . #% The Bush administration has argued that the Geneva Conventions are obsolete when it comes to dealing with terrorists and has chosen to apply neither these conventional laws of war nor the criminal law in which human rights norms should apply , that is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the US Constitution . #% We need to know what progress you have made with that brief . #% Turkey is a key member of the Atlantic alliance , a democracy with a pivotal role at the interface between West and East , and a country that is changing fast with a growth rate that puts her among global leaders . #% There are only 36 amendments to my report , and most of them have been tabled by the Green Group in any case . #% We tried to make a break in this proposal with in-depth hearings to understand the issues and I hope that we have a substantial measures of consensus within Parliament on many of the key problems and how to solve them . #% 
We were not demanding an EU inspectorate but simply that Member States should agree to bring their national inspectorates up to a common high standard . #% She had to change hotels . #% This is what is required . #% Once again the Commission are being profligate and irresponsible with other people 's money . #% I suggest that you should try - or get your staff to try - to sell the idea to television companies . #% The second area that we focused on in second reading was to ensure that small - and medium-sized enterprises also benefit from the sort of users ' rights that are required for individual consumers . #% Please would Iran help these soldiers be released if it is serious about developing peace with the rest of the world . #% Britain and France should lead by example and unilaterally dismantle their illegal nuclear warheads , and the EU and its Member States must present an action plan and timetable for achieving a nuclear-free Europe . #% Let me say straight away that I welcome the proposal by the Commission to extend European Community support for the International Fund for Ireland for a further two years . #% I hope that it will be possible , together with those who are responsible for these things in the PSE Group , to come to an agreement whereby we ensure that the requisite majority is garnered during the votes tomorrow . #% Mr President , this is not specifically about our agenda for this mini-session but a matter that affects our work generally and therefore the June I partsession . #% It would be one of red lines -- we , too , can have red lines . #% I hope the Commission will address its internal structures again . #% This influences the low and declining turnout in European Parliament elections - down to 49 % at the last election . #% Some members of staff of the European Parliament both here and in Brussels , when they try to enforce European Parliament rules - in other words , no smoking in no-smoking areas or any of the other European Parliament rules - are sworn at and abused by some Members of Parliament . #% The Zanu-PF regime is an appalling example of the repression of an impoverished and starving people . #% The timing of accession should not be vulnerable to unrelated concerns about future enlargement . #% It is common sense to separate toxic material from passengers and to observe international agreed regulations . #% And now you are looking for a remit over one of the last wildernesses in the world , the Arctic . #% One of the points of debate has been over the so-called ` services of general economic interest ' , but we should remember that different countries define these in different ways . #% If they have , I can say with absolute certainty that those amendments will not be carried in the House - we know that from the margins in the Employment Committee . #% And where appeals are successful , the necessary compensation will be provided according to national law and corrections . #% It was , after all , this Commission which - as soon as we had prima facie evidence that gave us legal security in undertaking certain actions - suspended contracts , opened disciplinary proceedings , established the strongest , biggest ever inquiry task force in the history of the Commission , increased the staffing of the internal audit examination of contracts from 9 to 24 persons and has had those reports coming in absolutely on schedule . #% I hope that this report and the Commission initiative will be another step in the process of ensuring that such devastation can never be allowed to happen again , either in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the European Union . #% His new empire will produce taxation policy and he will look after the customs union from Cork to Vilnius . #% That is why I think this is a failing of the annual economic report because what we need to do is look at how we can generate policies to generate jobs . #% If the challenge of the 1980s was to complete the single market , the challenge of the 1990s to complete the single currency , the challenge at the turn of the century must be to create and make enlargement work for the benefit of the European Union . #% In the context of a global changing market , any agreement on the liberalization of trade set to take place in the timescales envisaged would be unlikely to survive . #% It is right that we hold the line . #% We share the concerns , but we prefer to work together with the Commissioner to constructively tackle the causes of these problems in the future . #% Of course , until we know Council 's agreed position , if there is one , it is difficult to say how those negotiations will go . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Party of European Socialists I would like to welcome this new approach to the maritime sector from Commissioner Kinnock . #% She said yes - a European public prosecutor will almost certainly lead to corpus juris , a common body of law throughout the Community . #% It produced some strange results : the Labour Party that now forms the government won 55 % of the seats based on only 35 % of the vote . #% There is no reason why we could not have two sessions in Strasbourg - one being of three days and one of two days within the same week . #% But it is animal and human health which is the issue before us and the ELDR Group is united in its belief that products need to be clearly labelled so that consumers can make proper choices . #% As regards consumers , there we are pleased to see that the agreement reached on the Whitehead report and the conciliation on the Whitehead report last year has been honoured and the money will come through . #% Something not mentioned by other colleagues is the continued use of animal tests to assess detergents . #% Thank you for that response . #% I hope that you will convey that message . #% In my own experience , labelling materially affects one 's decision . #% When this petition was put to the Commission , I believe the Commission behaved correctly . #% I would also like to commend the Finnish Presidency on another of their initiatives which is the attention they are giving to the development of the information society . #% I can not support that . #% I do not think I listed as much a detail in that answer as perhaps I hoped for when I first put the question . #% Women are increasingly achieving more top positions in society and this will continue to improve as , in my country at least , women are more successful than men in gaining university places . #% Apart from wanton destruction of property and life , it has led to further alienation of the Muslim community . #% The Commission itself , had it wished , had the power to impose a fine of something like EUR 20m - perhaps even more - if it had taken this seriously . #% The cosmetics industry should recognise the strength of feeling in this Parliament . #% Once we have specific answers to these questions , we will come back with proposals . #% That spirit in which she approached the report is clearly shown in the quality of her work and , to echo what the Commissioner said , it is a very well-balanced document . #% These proposals take us a good deal further down the line in the field of diagnostic testing , in a more sceptical attitude to animals which ought to have been under suspicion but in some Member States were not , and in terms of the general prospect of fallen stock being tested for the possibility of BSE . #% The UK is recognised as a legitimate Nuclear Weapon State under the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and Conservatives support the aim of eventual global nuclear disarmament as set out in Article VI of the NPT . #% Any future outbreak must allow vaccinated animals to remain in the food chain to prevent such a terrible waste of resources . #% My group accepts the use of this concept as a guidance , but it must be one which is capable of being rebutted in an individual case . #% Further , any deal needs a waiver from the World Trade Organisation , which they have n't approved as some member countries ( notably India ) are worried about the effect that duty-free Pakistani textiles would have on their own markets . #% Sadly , the Belarus House of Assembly is barely recognisable in western terms as a freely-elected Parliament . #% In response to the amendments proposed by Mr Miller , the Commission can not accept Amendment No 9 , which asks for the expenditure for the early retirement scheme to remain non-compulsory . #% Naturally we deeply regret the loss of many lives and the displacement of nearly 40,000 people from their homes as a result of military activity in the Caucasus region . #% As a beginning , I would say the Environment Committee would like to reiterate the demands it made last year with regard to the budget . #% Sadly , she is ill and is only slowly recovering . #% We therefore urgently need to bring forward revisions of that sort . #% Some companies in my country which believe that they can pull out of defined benefit schemes have even looked to this particular directive as an excuse , but Brussels gives no such excuse to those companies . #% Mr President , for some years Iran has sought to export its fundamentalist revolution beyond its Shia lands to Sunni population areas , including Palestine , where , through Syria and its proxy terrorist Hezbollah , it liaises with Islamic Jihad and Hamas , both committed to theocracies under Sharia law . #% I commend this report and I commend the rapporteur for a job well done , not least because of the inter-party and inter-country cooperation and discussion throughout . #% Mr President , we have heard several times during this debate of the need for a negotiated settlement and a peace process . #% 
This is madness : it is bad for Turkey , subversive of the European Union and it displays a vast and astonishing absence of self-confidence inside this Parliament for European projects . #% 90 % of Spaniards have never heard of the Convention . #% To give yourself a bit of breathing space , I suggest that the first thing you should do is kick the proposed Constitution firmly into touch . #% Thirdly , to join with Parliament in calling upon the Council to remedy the exclusion of Parliament from the macroeconomic dialogue agreed at Cologne . #% Europe 's preoccupation with counterterrorism and with migration should not dictate that resources should be diverted away from our essential task , which is to work with the pressing needs of the world 's poorest people and poorest countries . #% This , of course , is between ourselves , but it is a small step forward for Europe . #% What happened to President Prodi 's idea of a rapid rebuttal unit ? #% It is a pity that the Council is not with us because it too could have been part of this debate . #% We have also created the opportunity for the Commission to come forward with its report on the working of the Agency and to make suggestions as to further tasks and roles that the Agency might fulfil , in the light of experience . #% Saying that Member States ` may ' is not the same as saying they ` must ' or that they ` will ' . #% Being a shuttle service - for which it is not economically viable to keep spare aircraft - if a breakdown occurs early in the day , all subsequent flights are affected . #% He went out into the street and saw his friend ' s body . #% Mr President , I would like to put forward an oral amendment to rectify an unfortunate typing error made initially . #% I just want to remind the Council that we are one of those institutions , and it will need Parliament 's agreement to get an interinstitutional agreement . #% I would remind the Commissioner not to personalise debates in the way he did - although there was an element of humour about this - because I represent the views of the committee and the amendment he referred to was adopted unanimously by my group . #% After all , the money which stays in Russia , even if it is on the black market , has an economic effect . #% It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States , especially Britain and France , seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty . #% There has been a suggestion that somehow we should withdraw this motion for resolution that Mrs Sommer says is undemocratic and non-transparent - that her group knew nothing about this . #% Sadly , the Irish antidote to all this appears to be ` more of the same ' . #% First I think the strategic importance of electronic communications and the Internet are increasingly well understood by everyone in this House . #% All I can say to that is ` phooey ' . #% Without that protection the UN agencies simply can not function . #% Most of that ` help ' merely interferes with their activities , and the idea of yet more ` help ' will be greeted with horror . #% Securing improvement through mandatory clauses and requirements in trade agreements is one way to achieve this . #% How can such a ridiculous proposal as that on port and sherry be allowed to scupper the greatest opportunity that we have to offer real and practical solidarity to South Africa ? #% Madame President , the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament . #% People with disabilities are a marginalised group for whom existing , generalised human rights standards have not worked and who therefore require explicit standards to adjust the discrimination they face in society and the range of violations to which they are subjected . #% That is one of the main causes of instability in the world , and we must act before the tidal wave of weaponry overwhelms us all . #% Our American counterparts have already allowed the introduction of all the Basle decisions by secondary legislation and to delay unnecessarily would put European banks at a competitive disadvantage . #% We need to establish a clear European-wide framework in which the industry can operate and in which people can be confident and public safety ensured . #% Question Time is one of the important democratic traditions of this House . #% I hope Parliament can send a message that Nato and the Bosnian Serb police need to try a little harder . #% I have seen a lot of interest today in both the piracy issue and Rugby League . #% The European Parliamentary Labour Party ( EPLP ) recognises that the proposed Constitutional Treaty addresses many important issues which need to be dealt with in order for an EU of 25 or more member states to work effectively and democratically . #% Can you do it by 30 April , Commissioner ? #% Mr Perry said that he finds it shaming that the UK Government was so secretive that it undertook the withdrawal of documents . #% Where there have been problems they have been where it has been pressed into service for uses for where it is not best suited , e.g. packaging or children 's toys . #% Mr President , may I take this opportunity to be the first Member to congratulate Professor Diamandouros on his election as European Ombudsman . #% If he has not , then why has the Commission not consulted ? #% Instead of seeking common ground and leading the debate , France and Britain - the two countries most responsible for the mess in the Middle East after the First World War - have fallen out again . #% Firstly , that the European Union is capable of maintaining a common front during a crisis . #% Who could challenge such an ambition ? #% I can only reiterate what I have asked in the original question . #% But they have forgotten that changes in the production specifications of tyres affect not only noise , but also grip , safety , fuel economy , cost and durability . #% Given the often erratic nature of care and treatment in Member States regarding Alzheimer 's disease , the growing numbers and proportion of ageing citizens of Europe , and the evidence that increasing longevity does not always bring increasing quality of life , it is absolutely understandable that we should bring forward and demand urgent action on Alzheimer 's disease . #% Finally , I would also like to ask you whether you think it would be appropriate , now that apparently the appeal has gone in , for the ACP also to put in a parallel appeal and for the European Union to provide funding , resources and support for them in order that they can make their appeal as effective as possible . #% Using structural funds for preventative medical purposes and demanding specific conditions on employment of medical personnel are issues that are rightly the preserve of Member States . #% Madam President , there is no doubt about the importance of universities and education . #% Getting effective sanctions means firstly exploiting EU powers for anti-discrimination laws and agreeing the Article 13 Race Directive in record time sent the right signal of determination . #% The only problem for him is that ordinary people in his own country do not agree with his approach . #% We seem to forget that without European standards we will have a plethora of national standards , and that is not good news for business . #% The trouble is that Mr Belder can not see the wood for the trees . #% I was dismayed that the completion of the internal market was ranked well down the priorities in that original paper and there was only one page devoted to it in a voluminous document . #% Yet with proper preparation , we can ensure that our hangovers on 1 January 2000 will just be from bubbly and not from bugs . #% Now that we have finished the third and fourth phases , with teams of Member State officials and users identifying concrete suggestions to simplify legislation , it is right that we have a review . #% They will scale back your ambitions , but unless you aim high , you are bound to achieve low . #% I have to say that this was Parliament at its worst . #% I could decide to go on a gay pride march , but that gay pride march could be banned . #% I acknowledge her efforts . #% Granting preferential treatment was seen as a positive way of tackling some of the trade imbalances between the richer countries and the poorer countries . #% There is also the real question of what the real needs of enlargement are , especially within the institutions . #% It is never an easy matter to represent this House on budgetary matters , whether in relation to the Commission 's or Parliament 's budget . #% Finally , if our national leaders want to set an example of justice and good governance let them disown their own foreign ministers who disgracefully want to put the Agency for Reconstruction of Kosovo in Thessaloniki . #% But we must recognise that at last consumers and the travelling public are being given rights that they deserve , backed up with compensation when airlines fail in their promises . #% This act would allow parallel importing and would authorise the genetic production of patented medicines for the government 's non-profit , non-commercial use . #% We must make sure not only that funds are properly spent but that the ideas which are coming through are properly coordinated . #% 
I hope I will get injury time on Mr Muscat 's behalf for saying that , because I now want to make some warm remarks about the rapporteur , Mr Nassauer . #% Mr President , I wonder whether it would be appropriate at this time to congratulate Mr Lech Kaczyński , the Polish Law and Justice Party and the Polish people on the election of President Kaczyński in Poland on Sunday . #% There are reliable estimates to say that if the present state of the disease continues , every other 15-year-old girl in South Africa will die of HIV-AIDS . #% Now I come to the specific points contained in our questions to the Commission , which I feel still require a response . #% The situation today is different from the post-war era of 1951 , but the challenges may be similar , even if the practicalities will be different . #% Finally , I would thank Mr Newman and colleagues on the Committee on Petitions for the support and sympathy they gave to the pensioners . #% Romania 's largest investor is still France , but other EU Member States such as Germany , Italy , Greece and the United Kingdom are coming in . #% It was a major change for the better and it showed that we can intervene here and in the European Union . #% I was recently invited by your colleague , Commissioner Dalli , to represent the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection at a major trilateral summit between the Americans and the Europeans in China to talk about toy safety . #% The report also highlights a number of existing directives that are in need of revision . #% Alongside agreeing to sign the Annex we must ensure the necessary resources and will are available to transform what to date has proved to be mere rhetoric into reality . #% Social security systems do not always respond to that very well . #% Mr President , as I said when this regulation first came before this House , the concept of this proposal is in my view impractical , untenable and unenforceable . #% Some Member States will have reservations , but we must recognise that change is essential and that people must not be penalised in terms of their freedom of movement by unjustifiable and cumbersome administrative procedures . #% It seems time now to introduce smart sanctions against Mugabe and his henchmen . #% We should concentrate on two essential principles . #% Various speakers have mentioned the importance of that forum , which must be raised over the coming years if we are to get the Barcelona Process back on track and expanding . #% I shall begin with discharge 1996 . #% Also , credit rating agencies are now going to be regulated . #% One senior Ethiopian official said to me : ' The trouble with you Europeans is that your own vested interest seems to be your priority . #% Reform packages should not simply be imposed by IMF officials on the basis of purely technocratic standards . #% I have had representations to the effect that people are looking to the European Union for some kind of effective action , possibly - and this could be debated in the context of the resolution - some kind of sanctions under the Lomé Convention . #% My thanks are thus due to the Commissioner and to the rapporteur - indeed , both rapporteurs alike . #% Primarily we have to take tough action to prevent that illegal activity so that the political situation can be stabilised . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Macartney on his excellent report , setting out very clearly the issues involved in this fishing agreement with Latvia . #% We need new multilateral procedures , we need cooperation because the success of the global economy and the livelihoods of many people around the world depend on it . #% This would help researchers to publicise their work and would follow the example of the United States and Japan . #% The deaths and injuries in the rural areas and increasingly in the towns are deeply worrying . #% So I think the message that should go back to the Member States is that this Parliament believes that , until we get serious , the industry will not get truly serious . #% We need to strike a balance between introducing regulations that will allow the biotechnology industry to thrive in the future and maintaining public confidence . #% Things are not as they were . #% We have , however , suggested various amendments in case the proposal is not rejected outright . #% Secondly , in the United Kingdom we have had a number of studies on pollution looking at landfill and incineration . #% I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for ably piloting this legislation through the three readings in this House and through the conciliation procedure . #% The system needs well-run machinery consisting of clubs of all shapes and sizes and degrees of professionalism and we need to take the opportunity to reform it . #% Indeed , a study in France has now suggested that these scarves , Jewish boys ' skull caps and other religious symbols are ostentatious and provocative . #% It shows , yet again , that if the EU is the answer it must have been a very stupid question . #% We must make sure that we stamp that out . #% The one follows almost inevitably from the other . #% I and some colleagues here in the Chamber who sought the release of one of the presidential candidates , Dr Ayman Noor , on 12 March will be particularly interested in the outcome , since it was our intention to visit him in prison , where he had been put by the Egyptian authorities , having declared his opposition to President Mubarak . #% We have also , of course , tabled amendments to try to ensure a proper gender balance in the management structures of the Agency . #% Human rights are universal and indivisible , and to stand back and do nothing when somebody else 's basic human rights are attacked is to be complicit in that action . #% That is why the success of the Tampere Summit and this resolution are so important . #% It is high time that was done . #% Meanwhile , in speech after speech , Washington , with the security of a President in mid-term , has placed a vast army in the region and has explicitly talked about wider regime change . #% People caught reading its literature are still in physical danger . #% Commissioner Patten said that Afghanistan had reached a crossroads . #% We have to end this domination of our society by the producers and ensure that the concerns of consumers and ordinary people are given far more consideration . #% Mr President , I would like to thank all our rapporteurs for their work on a complicated yet important area within the transport brief , namely our railways and the future of our railways . #% Mr Titford mentioned the question of funding cultural organisations . #% I welcome the opportunities we have for deep engagement with India and for India 's wider regional role . #% We welcome the robust way that he has defended the balance of this directive . #% There are , however , ways and means of doing this . #% Whilst recognising that the election law safeguards female representation in parliament as well as the representation of minority views , we noted that the overall process leading to the elections did not provide a level playing field for contenders . #% The preamble to the proposal states that ` weak rules to prevent trade in illegally harvested timber ' are at the root of the prevalence of illegal logging , but what the Commission has come up with , I am afraid , will do nothing to change that . #% Instead let us thank those who have worked to create a modest , serious , legal and practical measure with an important impact , one which will help others to create even more effective measures in future . #% But let us also remember the Somali diaspora , which brings back some EUR 400 million per annum to the country . #% My final point is one that you touch upon quite politely in the White Paper . #% However , none of this would have happened if it had not been for the bravery of 77 Members of this House . #% It is neither desirable nor practical for this House to try to amend this proposal , which is fundamentally flawed . #% Mr President , can I say that I welcome any discussion about the possibility of making a greater use of biomass in the production of energy . #% There is an element of hypocrisy here , because half the House voted against having stronger measures on tobacco advertising and - I choose my words carefully - there are many Members in this House who are regular users , to different degrees , of alcohol , which is a very powerful drug . #% I trust your antennae are sensitive to this tendency . #% But that is no excuse for not adopting the precautionary principle and taking action to protect human life now . #% That means the end of common access and common resource . #% Rules for trade are needed , but I will not be sorry if consumer preference slows the pace of GMO development and allows us more time to assess the full consequences of their use . #% 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , some European governments actively participated in illegal rendition , torture and illegal detention . #% Following on from that , would the Council care to comment on the lackadaisical attitude by the football authorities as regards what happened at the England v. Spain game , where there was lots of racist chanting ? #% Mr President , I should like to address matters of procedure and of substance with regard to the hearings of the candidate Commissioners . #% The majority of the committee does not support the view that this directive should deal only with refugee status and that subsidiary protection could be dealt with at a later stage . #% Now we see the EU in its true colours , which are by no means green . #% It seems that the Commission fears a challenge on the GATT to freedom of trade and that there would be an adverse decision by the WTO on this issue . #% I do not need to say too much on category 1 , because Jan has already said it . #% The Court of Auditors quite rightly , in my group 's opinion , said that this posed a problem as regards abuse on the part of Member States . #% Clearly , in the sustainable inclusive economy there are a whole range of different issues in terms of having the human and financial resources available . #% I would like to end with an appeal beyond this House to the Commission and the governments of the Member States : learn the lessons of 2001 . #% No matter how small it may be , it is certainly one that works extremely hard . #% It is important not to get this political commitment mixed up with the technical issue of how such services ought to be delivered . #% We are all aware there are national differences , as well as differences within our own political groups , and to come up with anything that gains a significant level of support is quite something . #% Fourthly , the procedures of the committee and the criteria that it will use to formulate its opinions are set out in some detail for the benefit of Members ' courts and the public . #% This could well result in the under-reporting of cases , as we have seen in Switzerland recently . #% Would he like to estimate what percentage of success the Chinese people will get from these same negotiations ? #% We ought therefore to have a fresh political initiative in order to ensure greater stability in the region . #% I suspect that if we had a questionnaire about it , most of you would have no idea what those obligations are . #% I would have liked to have gone further and ask : Why do such reports , that type of own-initiative report , not stand in their own right as a report of the committee ? #% We recognise the need for a complete identification of all feed business operators , including farms , by adapting existing regulation systems in order to enable the competent authorities to inspect operators . #% He told me categorically . #% No , it should not be a central reference point of national courts . #% Our condemnation of the brutality of the Serbian repression must be unambiguous while making it clear that we will have no truck whatsoever with terrorism . #% Where we are moving towards greater food safety , safer food packaging , better labelling and so on , we should not require EFSA to do all the work . #% It discriminates in favour of people in work and against the unemployed . #% But here we are , we are left with the report , and the fact that the Budgets Committee has not yet had its hearing . #% I would much prefer to be able to show people in the Member States that Parliament , the Council and the Commission heard and heeded the demands for change and modernisation and have worked together to bring about the changes needed to ensure that the citizens of Europe have the high quality , efficient , transparent and professional administration they deserve . #% Many ACP countries have lost more than seven times the amount they get in development aid . #% UK voters , given the chance , would have rejected the Constitution by a still wider margin than France or Holland . #% That will create two systems in one EU and lead to distortions of competition . #% How will we know when we have got a full set ? #% When you write to the Council perhaps you could also point out how hopelessly ineffective the Council 's own sanctions have been in respect of Zimbabwe and how they need to be toughened up . #% This is none of the EU 's business , and I advise the EU to stay out of it . #% We have not had a revision of these directives for nearly 20 years , so we are engaging in a bit of a fine-tuning exercise to modernise and update them . #% When they say , as one of them did , ` which part of the word ` no ' do you not understand owing to the French and Dutch results ? ' , we could easily turn round and say ` which part of the word ` yes ' do not understand from the 16 to 18 -- if you include Romania and Bulgaria -- other countries that have said ` yes ' to this constitution ? ' #% Can you give us some idea of that ? #% They were either the quickest prepared set of accounts in history or something magical happened . #% Mr President , on a point of order under Rule 9 ( 1 ) relating to Annex 1 , Article 4 , where it says : ' Members shall be subject to the obligations imposed on them by the legislation of the Member State in which they are elected , as regards the declaration of interest ' . #% It is a big improvement over MARPOL Annex VI , with the additional benefit of reducing particulates by 80 % and a substantial reduction in nitrogen oxide pollution . #% Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for her handling of what is a very complex matter where both producing and non-producing Member States have serious reservations regarding the Commission proposals . #% It is an act we should be commending , like , for example , the action taken by the media regulator against certain media with regard to their coverage of the alleged murderer . #% We have therefore put the 272 posts in reserve . #% I should like to know about the EU code of conduct on arms sales . #% Following the debates with the Council last night I was wondering whether this report is actually close enough to the original proposal for first reading procedure to be possible . #% I am sure the whole House will join me in expressing sympathy to her . #% In principle I would be against ever accepting an oral amendment that then leads to a roll-call vote . #% It is vital to get both parties back to the negotiating table as quickly as possible . #% As a result , farmers in the south will continue to have their livelihoods devastated . #% For sure this crisis is a welcome distraction for President Musharraf , under pressure now for dismissing his Chief Justice , attempting to justify five more years in power and keen , of course , to retain the pervasive influence of the Pakistani army . #% Amsterdam was already better than previous IGCs to a limited degree , in that it was prepared by a reflection group in which Parliament participated and which published its full report , in that every proposal tabled in that IGC was published and put into the public domain and in that Parliament was able to send two representatives to at least some of the meetings . #% I particularly want to thank my own team on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , many of whom will be speaking shortly , but we also worked very closely with our Liberal colleagues , particularly in the crucial vote that the Presidency was kind enough to mention earlier on . #% I certainly do not see the point in passing the recommendation if it was not intended to be implemented . #% In relation to the financial perspectives we are now discussing , we really do not have the options to deliver on the debates and on the commitments that you have discussed this evening . #% The Commission again , in relation to the sugar industry , and the ` Everything but arms ' proposals of a year and two years ago has not got a particularly strong track record in relation to impartial impact assessments and trade matters . #% Acute drug related deaths have doubled since 1985 . #% The Commission works closely with the European Union Member States in monitoring human rights developments in Vietnam and participates in all EU Troika approaches to the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues . #% I am aware that Denmark has already introduced legislation on this . #% I think we are going to lose a rather useful piece of legislation which would have put in place a necessary supervisory framework for one of the growth areas in financial services , namely the storage of cash on plastic cards and other forms of e-money . #% Mr President , on 28 April last year the President of France , Mr Jacques Chirac , said ` If a country votes against the proposed Constitution , it must leave the European Union ' . #% The reason , of course , is that the EU cares very little for democratic opinion and is determined to move rapidly towards ever-closer union despite a lack of popular legitimacy . #% It is particularly important that people understand that this crisis has affected every individual farmer , not just in France , but right across Europe . #% Are you imposing conditions on this troika visit , which would mean that they are absolutely obligated to give that kind of access ? #% We hope not . #% Now we have IRA terrorists in government . #% I am sure that full advantage will be taken of the slight pause that it is generally agreed is needed if we are to achieve our objective of a speedy and efficient aid effort for the benefit of and with the assistance of the people of Kosovo . #% As the Commissioner well knows , there are other places where these things will be discussed . #% 
It attracted broad support and was also in line with the accepted practices of a number of Member States . #% It is quite mad for this Parliament to be having Parliamentary sessions on important questions - as now - at the same time as voting in committees . #% In that case , which would have the overriding force ? #% But if we just sit back and say that everything is fine or just say `` no '' to drugs and that people should not use them , we are not accepting the situation as it is ; we are not giving the tools to those people who want to improve the position . #% Footballers continually practise ball skills and teamwork ; they do not prepare for a match by playing cards in a backstreet bar ! #% A 2007 target date will cost an extra # 143 million , bringing the costs of meeting the new targets from # 397 up to # 540 million over a five-year period . #% We could have got a better deal for the entertainment and leisure sector and I am sorry we did not take that opportunity . #% The message for the French Presidency is that we want tangible progress . #% Trans-national political parties are a vital sinew of democracy , articulating the anxieties and the aspirations of the citizen on a European scale . #% This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details . #% Furthermore , the entire generous aid package to the Palestinian Authority was predicated on a commitment to a two-state solution , achieved by peaceful negotiations . #% It is said that the flu virus is killed at 70 degrees -- given an absolutely perfect situation -- but we do not know how these products are cooked . #% If we are not prepared to take serious action promptly in future we will see further problems of this kind affecting future generations . #% India must match our resolve and bolster its promises for Helsinki . #% So I urge you to pause and think again . #% The situation in parts of Kalimantan is intolerable and I back this motion totally . #% Does the Commission agree that some Member States , including the UK , have not taken the fullest advantage of the flexibility allowed under existing CAP rules ? #% I have worked very closely with the Commission and the Commissioner . #% We have all come a very long way since last August . #% I wonder what the Commissioner has to say about that particular aspect of the industry . #% That is why I support a full impact assessment being carried out before any proposals are brought forward . #% Is the Commission going to propose an extension of the directive to coincide with this particular regulation and is it prepared to review the ceiling for the Seventh Shipbuilding Aids Directive ? #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I would like to echo the calls that have been made for a comprehensive strategy here . #% The Presidency says that it backs it : well , it should back it publicly and explicitly and make sure that the rest of the Council does as well . #% I also think we need to mix fuels much more in order to get a quality of fuel that is good for motor engines . #% Many years ago , I used to lecture on this subject at Cambridge University , and I would suggest that you would do well to read some of my old lecture notes . #% Therefore we , as a Parliament , should look at each of these cases as it stands . #% The Americans are no angels when it comes to WTO negotiations and we have to be very careful not to lose out in those negotiations . #% As we have heard today , justice should be universal and not dependent on nationality . #% Madam President , the reason I believe France should immediately lift the ban on British beef is because Britain has met the requirements of the Florence agreement . #% These are items I would have thought we were by now starting to reduce the payments for . #% The Green Paper and the report defined convergence as growing together and interchangeability of networks and channels for communication , and , in addition , the integration of distinct technologies in the new forms of applications and services . #% Given these conflicting aspects of the Barroso Commission , I have reluctantly decided that I have no alternative but to abstain . #% Mr President , if the waiver on titles 3 and 4 of the Helms-Burton Act goes through - which is unlikely in view of the statements of Senator Jesse Helms - would not efforts to deter future public support for investments in so-called expropriated properties be contrary to agreements made by individual European Union Member States and Cuba ? #% I hope that they will feel that the proposals I have put forward and the active agreement of several of the Member States , indeed including Sweden , will produce the kind of result that they want of dedicated rail-freight freeways with a sensible system of management and a good system of pricing that really can prove to be commercially attractive to those companies which want to move large amounts of freight to do it dependably and at competitive prices . #% There has been a tendency in the two previous years to be a little bit too sanguine about the prospects for the European Community 's economy . #% Mr President , I apologise to Mr Schmitt and to Mr Collins for the fact that I was delayed elsewhere and did not hear their introductory remarks . #% However , I would like to talk very briefly about the whistleblowers ' charter , which is something I know Mr Prodi mentioned in the Committee on Budgetary Control 's meeting earlier today , because his Commission 's biggest failing has been the way it has treated some of the whistleblowers . #% The EU must match that shift and demonstrate the crucial equality and equity required to the creation of a Palestinian state , living in peace with Israel . #% Key to that is the Lisbon process , which is running out of steam , hamstrung as it is by a surfeit of generalities , a lack of specific targets , and by the Member States ' failure to implement what they have agreed to . #% Mr President , by definition all modern military weapons are a source of death and destruction , but antipersonnel mines are particularly pernicious as , after the cessation of hostilities , their continued presence results in the ongoing death and mutilation of innocent civilians , particularly children . #% I can and do argue to my eight million constituents in London -- a figure , incidentally , which makes us a city state larger than 11 Member States but without the equivalent representation -- that they should pay for sustainable rural development . #% Secondly , how do the agencies perform against the criteria ? #% What they are being told , as their government is collapsing , is that it would be inappropriate for them to have a general election . #% To tackle that misinformation fully we must put our own house in order and reform the European Union tobacco production sector rapidly and completely . #% On 25 October we are meant to be celebrating the European Day of Civil Justice . #% Where I part company with the rapporteur is in my belief that we will need European action to ensure that banks do not pass on to customers conversion costs in stage 3 of EMU . #% So far as we are concerned , the stable partnerships to be recognised will include homosexual partnerships which will be regarded in the same way as heterosexual partnerships and subject to the following conditions : firstly , the couple must provide a legal document of an EU Member State which acknowledges their status as non-marital partners . #% we do not share the enthusiasm for an International Criminal Court which might so easily become a political instrument and whose jurisdiction over real human rights abusers such as terrorists is unclear . #% I would particularly like to thank you , Commissioner , for the effort you made to get here tonight , after the lengthy day you have had , and also for the work of your staff . #% We feel perfectly able to do this in the case of what we believe to be terrorist organisations , but seem totally incapable of doing it with those who cause massive numbers of deaths elsewhere in the world . #% We consider that each Member State must carry out a complete reassessment of its approach to the security of infrastructure and installations , particularly the most risk-sensitive such as nuclear installations . #% Yet it is they who are controlling what we know and it is they who control what coverage we get and we must be circumspect . #% I welcome the fact that there is widespread recognition in this House to extend these supplementary schemes throughout Europe , even if there are disagreements over their precise nature and the way that the funds are to be invested . #% Amendments that bring the military into the scope of the Single European Sky regulations will clearly be opposed by some Members and , I fear , by many in the Council . #% It is not your fault , you are not responsible for every detail , but when is the Presidency going to start timetabling debates properly ? #% There is also the related research and the amount of money put in for the Meat Hygiene Service . #% The discussion this afternoon is yet another vivid reminder of injustices around the world . #% The information problem , which Mr Bonde just referred to , is treated like a straw in the wind , with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us , as citizens and as parliamentarians , although we have the right to it under the Treaties . #% Madam President , this morning the Commission President , Mr Prodi , has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years , laudable aims indeed , to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world : succeeding with enlargement , meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe , introducing better principles of governance . #% An EU with Turkey as a Member State will entrench values of multiculturalism and understanding between different religions and therefore strengthen all communities . #% Something surely , colleagues , must be done . #% A second fix I would like is the retention of national patent courts , instead of phasing them out after seven years . #% Further , why , in response to a number of questions here , the contract in the tender brochure , properly entered into , which was won by the Human Rights Foundation , was never enacted . #% On non-discrimination akin to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , for example , there is the right of people undergoing second line checks to have those checks conducted with dignity and , if necessary , in a non-public area . #% Mr Väyrynen should be congratulated on an excellent report , even if it is somewhat longer than he had originally intended . #% 
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I , too , would like to congratulate the rapporteur . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I agree with Mr Weber of the EPP that EU visa policy is extremely valuable and that technical standards and conditions of visa facilitation and visa waiver must be met . #% Clearly we have to start on political dialogue ; clearly we have to develop inter-parliamentary dialogue . #% This Parliament passed an amendment to exempt barometer-makers at first reading in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and in this Parliament . #% In recent years Afghans have been the largest single national category of those claiming asylum in the United Kingdom . #% When the Commission 's proposals first came out , it was the view of the British Government that they could be accepted as they stood . #% Mr President , it is always sad to talk about human rights abuses because we in the EU take for granted the universal rights that we exercise day in , day out . #% It is our experience that the licensing system in toto provides a false guarantee of safety , in that no predictive testing could accurately ascertain the full extent of toxicity and the potential health threat to humans or animals . #% Let me finally reiterate something on the debate with the Socialist Group on employee consultation . #% The good news is that Mr Hughes has confirmed to me this afternoon that the PSE Group will support that phrase . #% This signals to the world a curious sort of respect by the American justice system for the rule of law and human rights . #% Therefore , opening up the invisible cities of decision-making in Europe to the citizenry is absolutely vital . #% In this case we have made progress and I would like to pay tribute here to Mr Schnellhardt who has been the long-time rapporteur on this directive and also to Mr Imbeni , the chairman of the Conciliation Committee , and all those who took part . #% In these reforms across the institutions we also introduce a new category of contract staff . #% But to do that comprehensively will require amendments to the Staff Regulations and I am looking forward to the cooperation of Parliament and the Council in gaining the changes in Community legislation which are necessary to facilitate that further development . #% The UK will be granted bluetongue-free status , but farmers will still be allowed to vaccinate their animals against the deadly disease . #% During the last four years there has been one other case in which an official was suspended from duty on full pay for more than six months . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Erika Mann for all her work on this report and for her willingness and openness to at least consider other perspectives and views . #% The Commission is very worried about this report because it recognises that if we persist in insisting on a directive rather than a recommendation , the whole thing may founder in the Council . #% Having said that , and having heard the President of the Commission 's speech today , if that is ruled out and the things that have been demanded in this report are performed upon , then that judgement on this Commission should be left to another time . #% This fragmented approach is neither coherent nor sensible . #% Your record is appalling and the answer has got to be , for goodness ' sake , keep your nose out of this . #% Whilst , of course , we must find solutions to deal with the immediate consequences of these policies , and fiscal retrenchment is essential , we must equally importantly commit ourselves to economic reform : to extend labour market flexibility to create jobs , to open markets and remove barriers to trade , and to stimulate private investment so that we can fill the void left by reduced public sector spending . #% It is an extremely important point because if this is the Commission policy , a number of projects which are going ahead in some our most deprived regions will simply cease to go ahead . #% We understand that , now that the active phase of negotiations has started , Parliament needs to be frank about progress in its reports . #% I fully understand the situation on anti-dumping measures and agree entirely with the Commission 's outlook on it . #% The title of this resolution is somewhat restrictive and mentions a new financial instrument as if there were only one solution to the problem , but the text is fortunately much broader . #% Once low pathogen avian influenza is found in poultry , that poultry needs to be disposed of very quickly so that the potential for the disease to spread and mutate into a highly pathogenic form is stopped immediately . #% Until we get an answer to that , we can pontificate as much as we want about enlargement and will be giving a false impression until we know the cost . #% It is a disgrace . #% I also welcome the Presidency 's wish to scrutinise the effects of legislation and improve its clarity . #% Mr President , could you tell us whether any Members of this House declared a financial interest before voting on the previous report ? #% In fact the rebate was always going to be discussed last week because Mr Juncker was determined it should be . #% Many jobs depend on trading relations with China and the number will increase in the future . #% The question is : what should this role be ? #% The law must be respected . #% When reading the document , there is a strong sense of complacency , Madam Commissioner , a real lack of urgency about how to tackle the global economic political challenges facing the European Union . #% Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mr Provan on his very important report . #% Without this , police forces operating in the sphere of law and order will be working with one hand tied behind their backs compared with the criminal organisations . #% Despite the Commission 's insistence that this proposal is not aimed at tax harmonisation , it will force countries that apply tax on registration of vehicles to phase that out and it will make all countries apply the same level of emissions-linking to the so-called ` annual circulation tax ' . #% In our delegation visits from this committee , we have found all too often that national parliaments do not have a clue that these plans even exist and they certainly have not participated in them . #% The expression ` controllable forces of nature ' is a legal nightmare for many Member States . #% Following on from Mr Titley 's question to the President-in-Office , I welcome Mr Henderson 's confirmation that the issue of US involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be on the agenda of the EU-US ministerial meeting in Washington . #% Let us therefore have a loud fanfare for this step towards direct democracy , European-style . #% Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - Mr President , I would like to focus on three of the issues raised in my committee 's opinion . #% Eliminating the frustrating incidences of the double taxation of frontier workers represents a tangible boost to the much misunderstood concept of labour mobility . #% So that is why I ask Mrs Gál to continue her excellent work . #% Mr President , I sometimes wonder what the arguments are for the European Union . #% The second issue is the importance of having full employment : promoting employment is the greatest way of addressing poverty and social exclusion . #% We supported the ECOSOC proposal to look at the idea of a job-seeker 's permit , which could be of great assistance to small - and medium-sized enterprises . #% A Proclamation of Independence pledged both brotherhood to those former masters whom ` do us justice ' and ` its government henceforward to be one of justice ' . #% These are questions that we are clearly going to have to raise and the same applies to stability and security . #% A proposed amendment from our committee requires that all measures under this fund should be based on an approach designed to prevent any outbreak of xenophobia , racism , discrimination or inequality . #% I conclude by saying , on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task . #% All these issues are going to be vitally important in ensuring that the new framework is adaptable to the diversity of large and small credit institutions and investment firms in the European Union . #% As this Parliament 's rapporteur for Article 10 funding , the innovative projects , I know there is a great demand in the localities and regions to harness European support for their endeavour . #% However , for some time , sadly there has been a series of murky extrajudicial killings , allegedly carried out by the security forces . #% We ask : is this duplication worthwhile ? #% It is this : there are those who would say that this debate embraces the debate about copyright and trademarks . #% I fully support the European Parliament resolution which demands restitution of stolen assets , and I trust that the Commission and the Council will do everything within their powers in that area . #% If the bulk of people have to wear a seatbelt in a coach but those at the back , in a so-called cosy corner , do not have to wear one , it simply does not make sense . #% One of the greatest benefits of the question time arrangement is the way in which it endows me with instant expertise on issues as far apart as fishing , olive oil and human rights in China ! #% The Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report covers a wide range of issues which could be considered in the framework of the IGC which is taking place over the remainder of 2000 . #% As Mr Bonde rightly pointed out , we should have a European Union where there is a free flow of information from the bureaucracy to all our citizens . #% I thank the Commissioner for all the information . #% Yes , in all probability they will . #% 
Mr President , I hear what the minister says ; I accept that the guidelines are better than nothing and I congratulate the Danish presidency on at least achieving them . #% That is why everyone is right to congratulate Mr Nobilia , our rapporteur , on the skilful way in which he has struck a balance between environmental concerns , consumer choice and information and the industry 's interests , so as to come up with a proposal that we can unite behind here today . #% The Iraqis are just like us : they share the same desire for freedom and for a settled society . #% On behalf of the PSE , therefore , I can say that we will support the two amendments that we tabled down in the plenary but reject the majority of amendments which either defend the nuclear industry as if no problem exists , or damn it as some form of devil-incarnate industry . #% This is not just an issue of support for non-governmental organisations ; it is also about our support for the whole principle of good governance . #% Also it is important to stress as some seem mildly confused about this , that this proposal is based on Article 138 , previously Article 118a , which laid down the minimum requirements for ensuring a better level of protection for workers health and safety . #% Further , while being sensitive to the socio-economic function of cotton-growing in certain regions , we strongly dispute the rapporteur 's assessment that cotton is less environmentally hazardous than other crops . #% I do not mind that but when the ` unspeakable ' begin to peddle the ` eatable ' , they should be open to the hygiene rules , as set down in this regulation . #% My mate says ` what be 'm going to do about it then , dig it up and put it in trucks and pile it up on Dartymoor so we can go and have a looky at ` n ? ' #% Do not let other people go through what we did last year . #% Yet not many of us are aware of the other crisis in Uzbekistan . #% As for the arguments as to whether or not the lobbying we have had represents patients - I believe this is a sterile debate . #% That way we can ensure that all of us benefit from the continuing prosperity in Hong Kong . #% Is it the case that , if there were to be underspending , the money could be relocated ? #% Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ? #% Mr President , on a procedural matter . #% I of course deeply regret Mr Karimov 's refusal of an international inquiry and so I call upon the OSCE to involve the little-known Moscow mechanism last used with Turkmenistan , also an authoritarian regime , to impose an international inquiry and to report with or without Uzbekistan 's consent . #% Finally , we look to the Commission to weave into this issue of security of supply the related question of climate change and how we adjust our energy policy in a post-Kyoto era to achieve our three aims of sustainability , competitiveness and security of supply . #% I do not want to delay the House unduly , but I think that as we prepare to debate the construction of Europe , it is important to take note of a landmark court judgement in the UK . #% Also , in terms of human resources , we have to have the kind of training or advice that is necessary to help these businesses flourish in the first place : life-long learning and initiatives in vocational qualifications can seen as the start of the spread of best practice , as is the introduction of business mentors in certain countries and developments in school curricula . #% I admire Commissioner Monti and the way he has resisted the pressure from the alcohol and tobacco industries to try and have this decision reversed . #% They are entirely within their rights , of course . #% Bearing in mind that people are living longer and need to work longer , the apparent need for more experienced people and the excellent decision that has been taken by the Irish Government , could the Council not now , without waiting for the IGC , examine the situation and bring forward proposals to abolish age discrimination throughout the whole of the European Union ? #% We all want single market considerations to prevail and that leads eventually to having a Community patent , but the consultation shows that there are steps that can be taken to improve the process . #% Secondly , once again we expose the hypocrisy of a European Union that pays lip-service to health promotion by combating smoking-related diseases but continues to pour EUR 1 billion per annum into subsidising the production of low-quality tobacco , much of which is exported to developing countries . #% I wish to extend those congratulations to all the members of the Committee on Women 's Rights and all Members who have contributed to the formulation of the programme and the plan of action to combat violence against women and children . #% Mr Barroso sensibly understands that many remedies for the lack of economic dynamism lie in the hands of Member States themselves . #% That ambition is shared universally by my colleagues and we could not have made the progress we have unless we had had massive cooperation from staff assuming these obligations in addition to their normal workload and if we had not had the full-hearted commitment of every single Member of the College of Commissioners . #% Most public transport systems are good for the commuter but do not fit the needs of the businessman who must drive into work in order to use his car to visit clients later . #% I now turn to the Goodwill/Bernier Amendment No 18 , as Mr Goodwill would expect me to , exempting hunters from these regulations . #% Paragraph 4 states that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq 's obligations . #% These are common sense proposals from Mr Fantuzzi for greater transparency and clarity in the implementation of the regulations which will benefit both producers and consumers . #% One of the problems we face in this House is that we often orate about how everything should be perfect without always ourselves being willing to seek the means to go with the ends : the means to allow us to have an effective FVO , which at the moment is overstretched and understaffed ; the means to have a proper process of scrutiny whereby every Member State , great or small , whether its population is a few hundred thousand or many millions , takes equal precautions and provides equal information . #% Has the Council not considered the possibility of delaying the issuing of the 500-euro note because , with the introduction of the euro , there will be a particularly dangerous window of opportunity for counterfeiters potentially to have a field day , as millions of people around the world will never have seen these notes before . #% But - and this is a crucial issue she did not mention - it allows the industry , and everyone else involved , to tackle the issue on a broad front because we know that simply making the front end of cars more resilient in the event of a crash is a second option . #% And there is a series of new criminal cases . #% On targets , I very much side with Mr Linkohr . #% One of my greatest concerns about this initiative is its funding , both substantively and in terms of its publicity . #% We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency , public participation and collaboration . #% Mr President , this is a rare occasion for me : I have more than one minute 's speaking time and for once I am not going to disagree with anyone ! #% The European Central Bank is a new institution that has to earn the confidence of the public . #% However , tidying up the ETS in both methodology and targets is something the EU must crucially put into action to remain a world leader in both working for a cleaner environment as well as sustaining a pan-European energy policy . #% I understand that some Member States have reservations about the detail . #% My political group has tabled amendments relating to that human factor . #% We thank you for the informal receptions which are very nice but they are no real substitute for a formal dialogue . #% Firstly , on Amendment 328 to line 22 02 02 ` Transition and institution-building assistance to potential candidate countries ' : this is accepted with + EUR 2 million for commitments and payments . #% We must reject the Commission 's proposal . #% Unless we , as parliamentarians , examine ourselves with the same forensic attention with which we examine other institutions we will find it difficult to reverse the shocking voter apathy which was seen in so many parts of Europe in the elections in June . #% For them , however , Crunchie time has come and they now have Creme Egg on their faces . #% Smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that . #% In that context , the renewed justification by former President George Bush of water boarding - which is unequivocally torture - sums up everything that went wrong in the disastrous eight years of his Presidency and that made the West both less free and less secure . #% In order to proceed with the welcome and ongoing peace process between India and Pakistan , Pakistan must implement the solemn assurances it has given to stop all cross-border terrorism and to deliver on the words of President Musharraf in this Parliament on 12 September 2006 . #% This should begin right away with a tax on all domestic and intra-EU flights -- with the possibility of exemption for all carriers on routes where non-EU carriers operate . #% That is why I hope when the transatlantic summit meeting takes place in a few weeks ' time , that rather than being just a thin audit of what has gone on in the past it pushes the agenda further forward , in particular on electronic commerce , fighting crime and fighting organized crime and drug trafficking in the third pillar areas . #% It is quite amazing that this House , which is keen to see the European project go forward , is very casual about the way it looks at the legal system it is trying to create for the people of the European Union . #% It is no good us debating conflict resolution in the Parliament and then finding that the sole support to assist people when the guns are put down or when the period of immediate humanitarian assistance is at an end is then forgotten altogether . #% Last week , Birmingham City Council , one of the major local authorities - not just in my region but in the whole of Europe - said that it will be reviewing its use of temps which currently cost EUR 20 million per year . #% I would urge that we should consider preserving sites and using sites in that way rather than simply clearing them off the face of the earth at great expense . #% As for their wider role in smaller installations , we hope the Commission will come forward as quickly as possible with a proposal to ensure that new low-solvent paints and coatings are used , and other less harmful substances are introduced . #% Unfortunately Britain 's big stick -- its armed forces -- is being merged into the euphemistically named European Defence Identity , i.e. a European army . #% Only this week , we have had further flooding in Cornwall , which is in my region . #% It seems that , whenever there is a choice between a simple and effective scheme and one that is costly , bureaucratic and inefficient and also criminalises the business fraternity , the European Union always goes for the latter . #% My impression is that absolutely nothing has been done . #% In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future . #% Adequate and inadequate , in my view , are not particularly appropriate terms to use . #% Mrs Gradin replied to my 22 November letter on 29 December and I wrote a further letter to her on 25 January 2001 . #% 
I regret that Parliament did not vote to strengthen the commitment to the right of those people for self-determination through a plebiscite . #% Remember that the problem for both Germany and France began because of the budget relaxations , the tax cuts and public spending increases introduced between 1999 and 2002 . #% Such a chamber would be stuffed with dutiful poodles of the Council , making a mockery of parliamentary involvement in European affairs at the national level . #% Even more important - as Mr Poettering told the House earlier on , and other speakers have referred to this - last night the PPE-DE Group heard Yelena Bonner describe the situation in Russia today : Mr Putin came to Stockholm , Mr Persson gave him a cheque for EUR 100 million , the very next week Mr Putin begins yet another crack-down on the media . #% Unfortunately the Belgian authorities refused to use that . #% The precautionary principle is no frivolous luxury ; it is an absolute necessity . #% They work after a fashion and , while we thank the rapporteur for working on the system of convergence plus freedom , which gives Member States the freedom to set their own rules , we do not need your freedom . #% The committee 's report achieved a number of important objectives : a reduction in travelling times ; upgraded transport conditions , including provisions for rest periods , feeding and watering ; additional training for drivers and animal handlers ; improved enforcement of the rules ; stronger rules relating to journey planning and registration ; satellite monitoring of vehicle movement ; the ability of Member States to ban export of animals for slaughter is included ; there is a preference for slaughter near to the farm and encouragement for mobile slaughterhouses . #% When this agreement was completed , however , my first thought was lucky Mexico . #% Let us take , for example , the reception conditions directive which highlights the classic danger of the ` lowest common denominator ' approach imposed by the unanimity rule . #% Everyone in this House knows how much time has been spent on this directive . #% It did not work in getting rid of apartheid and it will not work with Mugabe . #% I would be grateful for a correction from Mr Howitt , as otherwise legitimate debate on accelerated EU membership for Turkey will be stifled . #% The GSP , or its worth , is not going to be there for ever , as tariffs go down across the board . #% I am very glad to say , however , that they have not been of a nature or of a length likely to cause any severe disruption to the reform schedule . #% While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points , detail and precision are obviously essential . #% Its own communication is lacking in strategic thinking , and we need to make great progress on that issue . #% Unless we do that , we shall continue to adopt legislation which all countries agree with , but which in some countries is ignored and which a lot of countries can not afford . #% The IDA programme is more complicated . #% I would recommend to you a booklet which we have about the Code against Cancer , which outlines all of the recommendations together with the ten points which have been drawn up by cancer experts from all over the Union . #% The reason why I mention these points is just to lend some balance to the argument . #% All of which is not speculation , as an independent survey of over 500 haulage companies from my constituency indicates . #% This is a matter which requires immediate attention . #% I do not know how many this concerns , because there is more than one server . #% His point about language hegemony was a cheap point , which regrettably diminishes my respect for him , and what he says has absolutely no foundation at all in anything that I or my fellow Commissioners have said or done . #% Mr President , I wish to express my concerns about recent developments in Zimbabwe , in particular the closure of the only remaining independent newspaper in the country , the Daily News , in spite of a High Court decision to the contrary . #% The fact is that the Council did not will the resources , or the means , to the Court to do all this extra work . #% Please support the Cappato report , as amended . #% Mr President , this is a very wide-ranging report and there is much in it with which to agree , including the need for a comparative evaluation between EU development projects and those of individual Member States , our long-running demands for budgetization of the EDF , and the need to publicize the very many positive achievements of European aid programmes . #% In the past few years , all we have had is an occasional visit from a representative of the Council , sometimes when the Ombudsman was present to give a report to the committee - which is welcome - but very rarely when there was a matter of particular concern to one of the Member States . #% But , as usual , Brussels will plough on . #% After all , South Africa is specifically responsible for the good governance aspects of NEPAD . #% To the European Parliament and the Commission I ask that we establish a permanent mechanism to monitor and report back on the human rights situation in Chiapas and the rest of Mexico - one which incorporates NGOs involved in the defence of human rights and which offers them increased direct European support . #% That is why we can not accept this system . #% The Commission still has to draw up its final report on the candidate countries , and we must ensure that the process does not degenerate into a messy argument about the imposition of safeguards . #% I refer , of course , to the organisation known as CDE , who , with Commission support , have dismissed all whistleblowers from office and have done little to put right failings in the governance and senior management of this organisation . #% Primary operational responsibility must be with the transmission system operators and , to some extent , the distribution system operators . #% I hope the Commission is making sure that remains the case and is not asking for such binding commitments . #% Commissioner , EU manufacturers and retailers who fear the future in a market swamped with cheap Asian exports need answers , which you hide from them . #% Indeed , if we were to criticise the Commission , we would criticise it rather from the other side ; we would hope that the Commission would take a rather more robustly liberal attitude , for example in the proposals which it has made for a directive on occupational pension funds , to remove the possibility of certain Member States deciding to continue to implement quantitative restrictions for which there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of any superior performance . #% Those unforgettable pictures must stand as a lasting reminder of what could happen again if we do not learn the lessons of this most terrible disease . #% Had Tony Blair negotiated a better EU Budget deal for the UK on rural development monies , our farmers would not be facing this bleak prospect . #% I hope that there will be a sensible conclusion to our debate . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by responding to the last speech . #% I would like to support , in particular , the involvement of patients and families of patients benefiting from the programme . #% Many of us have dealt with constituency cases concerning the difficulties of people temporarily moving to other countries -- particularly students or people taking up work or even citizens wishing to make long-term stays . #% We are very concerned in Europe that consumers should be protected , and rightly so , but what is the Commission going to do to protect European consumers from imports of poultry that have probably been fed growth promoters ? #% A UN resolution is required but we need the evidence to be brought up front , in front of the peoples of the world , to alter the perception of why this course of action is required . #% We all know that , improperly used , satellite tracking is just another form of Big Brother . #% My group agrees in principle with that , but we want some safeguards . #% If you indulge me , may I take the opportunity to thank the representatives of the Presidency for all the help and assistance they have given my colleagues over the recent months . #% Mr President , I am delighted to speak to the House - and in public - as a member of the gagged and muzzled committee of this Parliament which has been unable to conduct its business properly because of a decision by the Conference of Presidents about interviewing Mr Prodi on one of the subjects I will be raising shortly . #% We all remember the tragedies which seem to occur summer after summer . #% I believe the Rule in question used to be Rule 46 , though it may have changed . #% This is actually about the rights and the protection of children and young people . #% We should be generous in our praise for people like Simon and others in the Commission who worked tirelessly in bringing about this particular report . #% Events unfolding today before other committees suggest that this caution is necessary . #% The Vlaams Belang is now the biggest political party in Flanders . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by wishing Mr Juncker and his country a successful presidency . #% Any medical breakthrough that is achieved comes with a very expensive price tag , a price tag that 90 % of the people affected by Aids simply can not afford . #% This report should be seen in conjuction with Mr Ullmann 's report on electronic signatures and my own report , which will come up next month , on electronic commerce . #% Finally , Mr President-in-Office , you rightly emphasise your intention to focus on practical human rights issues . #% Mr Argyros and I have submitted a joint compromise text which I very much hope will meet with the support of this House . #% Can I also ask you : there is a practice within Member States , or some Member States , to feed what I would call banned substances to some of their beef cattle . #% I have no criticisms at all of the work of the rapporteur . #% We have had a good debate , a good exchange , but I still am left wondering whether it has truly been the strategic debate that should have engaged all of this House and our citizens outside . #% 
What we are talking about here is a regime that is legitimately going to encourage invention in all fields . #% We must make sure that disabled people really are at the top of the political agenda and that means that the employment directive must be fully implemented . #% Notwithstanding that , this is an important issue . #% In this question we have also floated the idea of establishing a reserve compensation fund , but this must not be seen as a demand on our part or by the Commission . #% As a result , you and 700 others have the freedom to come from the four corners of Europe to meet in this place . #% In that way they can develop their own solutions , and also draw on a much wider learning-community to help them develop the tools that they want -- the standard applications , the other ideas -- and they can exchange their work with each other . #% And shepherd 's pie labelled `` product of the UK '' may contain beef from Botswana , Zimbabwe or anywhere else in the world . #% The second point that I want to make concerns information technology . #% I think that we have some way to go , but this is a step in the right direction . #% It is one example of the people ' s agenda . #% I ask that the exclusion clauses should not be routinely considered for practical as well as humanitarian reasons . #% We want to make the internal market work and have British beef bought on the continent . #% Members of Parliament and , in particular , the rapporteur , Mr Cabrol , and the chairman of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , Mr Collins , deserve full credit for their efforts and their success in fashioning a major legal instrument of cardinal importance for Europe 's public health . #% So I am on the solid ground of what Parliament has consistently argued for over time in this and I would hope that the PPE-DE Group would rethink its position before we vote in half an hour 's time . #% The so-called Washington consensus needs to be reviewed . #% This ignores the real world and illustrates the typical short-sightedness of the EU . #% As I have mentioned , this would help those species that are not widespread . #% Twelve years later , countless resolutions later , countless promises later , countless inspections later , that commitment has still not been fulfilled . #% Parliament will have three months instead of just one month , as it has under existing procedures , to examine and take a position on such implementing measures . #% These two articles , in whatever combination , have to be read together . #% I think it is important , on the wider issue of our relationship with the Council on CFSP and other matters , that there be absolute consensus among the groups of this House which is why I did not press this matter , as you know we could have done , earlier . #% We went on to see it rapidly reversed by the new Labour Government , anxious to preserve jobs in the mining industry . #% The proposals will put us in a stronger position in the World Trade Organisation negotiations . #% Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions . #% But after various business and interest groups had got involved the proposal was reduced to 12 months only - with quarterly reviews ! #% That is a gross discourtesy to any Member asking a question of a body , which is supposed to be , there to serve and to be transparent in response to requests for information . #% A large number of French departments - I think about 23 departments - had not apparently been monitoring for BSE in the cattle populations within their departments , although they were departments in which there were a large number of dairy cattle . #% It is the role of legislators not to resist globalisation but to make sure its benefits reach as widely and deeply as possible . #% Lack of access led to the collapse of talks in Seattle and Cancun when ministers exercised the democratic right and said ` no ' . #% We then had a long period in labour from 4 p.m. in the afternoon until 4 a.m. in the morning , and at the end we gave birth to a programme which will stand the test , which is why we welcome this point on the debate today . #% All three issues which I raised are ones on which Parliament has the final say . #% In my own country in 1979 we had 1200 British-flagged ships , today the total is less than 250 . #% Why is the Commissioner seeking to reinvent the wheel when there are already satisfactory arrangements in place with the IEA for a regime of maintaining oil reserves ? #% Several governments have asked the Zambian Government to release him or charge him and , at present , he seems to be in a state of limbo . #% My reason for tabling the amendment is because , during the first debate on the Langen report , the Commission 's text called for a ban on any technical dialogue between a contracting entity and anyone who wanted to bid for the contract at a later point . #% It is quite right to harmonise the maximum sentences , so that wherever a criminal flees , he risks the same penalty - no hiding place . #% I find it somewhat patronising to be told that we will get action plans . #% When the Parliament 's Rules are being disregarded , it is quite in order for a Member to draw that to your attention . #% I hope this dossier will , therefore , be concluded at first reading . #% We also need to reassure the consumer about vaccinated meat products and develop and research more new vaccines . #% In the light of current circumstances , faced by at least the British wood industry and wood industries in other parts of the EU , it is a question we need to ask . #% It is absolutely essential that we leave no hiding-place for criminals , who can move very quickly with their information and their expertise from one Member State to another . #% In our discussions we have had two key issues before us . #% My father , Sir Francis Chichester , was a great competitor of Mr Tabarly 's . #% Mrs Breyer , who has put in an enormous amount of work on this and deserves to be commended for it , is absolutely right to draw our attention to the warnings of the latter - the pressure of the market to bring in new products which can not be scientifically tested . #% The massacre at the Burundian refugee camp of Gatumba last August was only one in a long series of provocative actions . #% First , may I say that your vote today will mark a further substantial step forward in the delivery of reform of the European Commission . #% Personally I would not trust the European Commission , past or present , to look after my grandchildren 's pocket money . #% As I have a few seconds left , I would like to challenge Mr Bradbourn from the ECR Group on an issue of free movement . #% Trying to break up the TV monopoly over premiership football has been a complete dog 's breakfast . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council for confirmation that information on which country voted in which way is not at the moment given when the Council issues its press releases at the end of each Council meeting . #% Clearly , we should be using the ASEM process therefore to see how we can ensure that this crisis is overcome very quickly and to ensure that the crisis does not get any worse . #% It should also be extended , but only in its present form , to the candidate countries , which could benefit very much from this programme for the objectives and the kind of things that the Fiscalis programme has been carrying out . #% We want to support , in principle , this global fund to fight communicable diseases . #% I strongly urge that we use all our efforts to promote re-use over recycling and recovery when we come to the full review of the packaging directive next year . #% In every practical sense it already does this through joint coordination meetings and , in any event , the conference works by consensus . #% In this European Parliament , more than anywhere else , we understand the prospect for generation after generation of division and fear which this new Berlin wall represents . #% Essentially , Commissioner Liikanen , the word from Parliament is to go and get on with it . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and my colleagues on working together to achieve the compromise formula and definitions , which have covered a very complicated and technical set of issues . #% That question then led us to another : the timing of this directive . #% I am delighted that both rapporteurs have taken this on board and am totally in favour of it . #% We represented the views of our national parties over there as well as the views expressed within the European Parliament . #% Mr President , on behalf of my group I congratulate Mr Bourlanges on the remarkable degree of consensus he has managed to build in the committee around the main proposals in his report . #% And if a measure is referred back to the legislative authority it should be referred to both branches of the legislative authority , not just to one branch . #% in writing . - The European Parliamentary Labour Party supported this resolution and gave support to underpinning the progress made last month in Pittsburgh . #% As Mr Sterckx has said , Europe could certainly add a great deal of value by having a situation in which we could learn from each other . #% 
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for being here . #% The need for land reform is more pressing than ever . #% If we are to compete in the world of high technology innovation and improve our post-innovative performance from its current lamentable levels compared to our competitors Europe must support innovation with public money where appropriate . #% In doing so , we have tried to include at least three or four priorities which they consider to be paramount priorities , and then ask the Commission and the Council , in paragraph 31 , to at least look at all the Annexes to get a feel for what the other committees are trying to do . #% Can we have a firm undertaking that there are no - I repeat , no - plans to re-open the whole debate ? #% Mr President , I want to start by congratulating my colleagues Mr Van Velzen and Mr Hoppenstedt as is customary on these occasions . #% I have kept in touch with him since and we have discussed the possibility of him coming to the Parliament to give an annual report on what is happening . #% However , I believe we should further monitor this situation in the interests of the public , consumers and public safety generally . #% But , as the Commissioner well knows , trade in animals , if it is not effectively handled , has led to the perpetuation of some serious abuses in the Community in recent years . #% We have accepted the principle that all documents should remain accessible and that , where not accessible , access should be reasoned against quite clearly and specifically in reference to either Article 4 - the exemptions - or Article 9 - sensitive documents . #% If we do not , nobody will understand or forgive us for not realising our aim . #% That is certainly not the way to ensure that Europe will flourish or that Britain will get the best benefits from its membership of the European Union . #% I very much hope that when we vote on this proposal they will at last feel positive and give it their wholehearted support . #% Disabled people , as we have heard , make up about 10 % of any population , but 20 % of the poorest are disabled . #% Finally , Mr President , the Commission would be in favour of Parliament being consulted before any decision by the Council on extending the agency ' s activities to other regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . #% If it is a bad rule it should be changed ; if it is a good rule it should be applied . #% Why was Mr Bhatti not shadowed by armed close protection officers ? #% This issue could quite simply be resolved and in many ways improved by the removal of phosphates from our laundry wash . #% In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind , not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner , but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted . #% It is a major contribution towards the peace process , in contrast to the American military aid in Plan Colombia , which we have roundly condemned . #% In the event that some regions need more time , I believe it is incumbent on both parties to seek to ensure that ACP exports to the EU should not be harmed . #% Since the level of public awareness about the implications and complexities of the GATS process has grown enormously over the past few years , can you tell us why you believe it is still appropriate to negotiate within the WTO on the basis of a Council mandate granted back in 1999 ? #% The main point , as Mr Fava has said , is that simply holding periodic elections is not enough to guarantee democracy in any circumstances . #% During the last three years or so , we have talked a lot but realistically we have achieved much less . #% What is very important -- and it was stated clearly by Mr Radwan , the shadow rapporteur -- is that yes , this is an important issue ; yes , questions need to be answered about how ratings agencies work and yes , questions need to be asked about whether we should have a registration scheme for ratings agencies . #% Far worse , they have given themselves the power to remove those rights and freedoms when it suits them or their successors . #% My big fear tonight is that we will conclude that Alstom may survive and get the support of the European Union . #% I am fully aware of the logistical and organisational difficulties that this presents , but action needs to be immediate and an emergency Council meeting is a small price to pay for ensuring that those in need receive protection . #% Civil justice can not just be an add-on to the internal market - some sort of limited competence where we tread only reluctantly at the invitation of Member States . #% Do not get me wrong : it might conceivably be necessary to weaken the common position when new information or evidence previously overlooked comes to light , but in my view that has not been the case in the examples I mention . #% While we certainly support that , we would prefer to have a compulsory system , were that to be possible under the statute . #% The European Parliament 's legal services wrote a note to the Budgetary Control Committee on 5 November 2001 giving an opinion on whether not granting discharge should lead to the fall of the Commission . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Theato . #% Taiwan is a thriving , wealthy and modern democracy that shares our values of supporting human rights , peace , security and prosperity in the region . #% So we need to find a sustainable way of keeping people active and healthy for as long as possible . #% . Mr President , Mr Böge has made imaginative use of the temporary committee formula and , for the second time , I congratulate him . #% I believe that there will be another vote before too long , perhaps within two or three months , because this is a democratically elected parliament . #% Gliders are grounded because perfectly safe winches no longer meet new specifications . #% 31 % of Germans have never heard of the Commission and 25 % of Britons do not even know that the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union but 7 % of them think that America is ! #% This report , and the original proposal behind it , would have grave implications for business and individuals alike . #% It is an important clarification . #% I would remind Members of the provisions of Rule 9 ( 1 ) , Annex I , Article 1 on declarations of interest . #% Since then the EASA has not proved itself competent , even in this area of work . #% In this debate we should really be looking at the implications of those changes and how we can maximize their effectiveness so that some of our concerns about how the CFSP has operated in the past will not be replicated in the future . #% Thirdly , the strong impetus that came with the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda now appears to be under threat because of a lack of political vision and , perhaps , frustration at the lack of results among many of the parties involved in the dialogues . #% I still believe that Article 175 is the necessary and logical legal base . #% Each Member State does it differently , because early years has grown up within their own systems . #% One very great merit of the report is its recognition of the effects where these problems are combined or aggravated . #% What is interesting about this case is the extraordinary lengths that the Commission appears to have gone to in order to give the impression that this is a much less serious case than it is . #% Why not pass a resolution calling for their government fully to respect the rulings of all the international courts , including the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg ? #% The recent horrifying case of a teenage girl buried alive for talking to boys simply gives ammunition to those who say that Turkey has no place in the European Union . #% Let us hope that this year we can improve from what I consider to be not a good start to a far better understanding between our two institutions . #% We should work together to end state monopolies that leave many of the poorest without essential services and we should be always be a friend to those entrepreneurs who want to tackle global poverty by creating wealth and jobs through increased investment in services . #% We are not one hundred percent happy . #% I wonder whether we would be having this debate today if the German Constitutional Court were still considering the Treaty . #% These are not being slaughtered in the interests of conservation , or with any reference to conversation in the areas . #% Mr President , you have already quite properly expressed the sympathy of this House to the Turkish Government and to the families of those killed and injured in the callous and indiscriminate terrorist attacks that took place in Istanbul on Saturday . #% For these reasons , I have tabled four amendments , for which I have already secured some cross-party support and I also propose to vote against Recitals 5 and 7 , as he knows . #% I am pleased to see that the five-year project has been telescoped into a four-year project instead . #% Mr President , I strongly support the report by Mr Staes . #% Having said that things are often best done at local level , many things can also be done at a European , or even a wider level . #% They do not want grand projects that erode the sovereignty of their nations or affect their chances of getting a job . #% While I would agree with Mr Pronk that a lot of this is about money , it is also about other interlinking factors like a lack of real equality of opportunity . #% Therefore , it is totally inappropriate for us now , in 2003 , to call for a regulation which will just separate two parts which work very well together and we will duplicate , replicate and complicate our efforts to eradicate poverty . #% I have personally been involved in Europe 's support for UNHCR for UN aids . #% By adding that phrase ` after the Kyoto conference ' we make that clear and I hope the House will then be able to support the revised text . #% 
If the result may be said to have a positive side , it is the fact that there is now no longer absolute power . #% We share the view , forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts , and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures . #% We are also sympathetic to the amendment from the Green Group , although I fear that this has less chance than ours . #% I would rather quote George Bush Senior : society is `` a thousand points of light '' , not `` a thousand flowers blooming '' . #% We want improvements in the single market and , as has been said before on many occasions , with something like 20 million small and medium-sized enterprises across Europe and 20 million people unemployed it does not need a mathematician to realize that if every company took on one extra member of staff , unemployment would be slashed right across Europe . #% As we consider the Europe 2020 commitments , we must once again think about what measures can be taken to fight poverty . #% Even in the United Kingdom , where enormous advances have been made , a young man was kicked to death just before Christmas for no other reason than he was homosexual . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , my party favours free trade and establishing good relations . #% My apologies for missing the first few minutes of this debate but , amongst a number of problems today , I was held up in the passport queue at the airport . #% But the EU may also need to look at introducing an aircraft noise limitation directive in order to achieve that reduction of , at the very least , 10 dBA , in recognition of the particular problems of a densely populated area like the EU . #% Parts of it are clearly crafted as helpful suggestions to the IGC ; other parts form a list of pious hopes and hopeful wishes which are certain to be rejected by the Conference . #% It is Kosovo that is to be reconstructed . #% There is no central point in the EU where policemen can go to find their contact in , for example , Lithuania , Portugal , the UK or Italy . #% The EU , in its continuous efforts to extend its own reach , is often complicit in this . #% Nevertheless , aid donors must still insist on verification procedures to ensure that the food gets through to those it is intended for and is not given to the army or , worse still , resold to raise cash for more armaments or luxuries for its political and military elite . #% Look at our case once again . #% There are a number of interesting facts and figures . #% I seem to remember saying a few weeks ago that I regretted that would be the last time he spoke as chairman of the Committee on Budgets , and yet he is still here . #% Mr President , when Turkey joins the European Union the impact and the benefits will be considerable . #% We hear much in this House about rights -- -- shareholder rights -- -- and I fail to see how they can object to the concept of people having rights in relation to their reproductive health . #% Firstly , I particularly want to thank all the members of my group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection who have worked so tirelessly with me to reshape this text . #% But a thorough discussion is required on implementing the goals of the cohesion policy before we make any decisions on the future financing of structural aid . #% We want to publish who has given the advice , not the advice itself . #% I would recommend that any long-term solution is more likely to follow from carrots and not sticks . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very detailed statement which , without wishing in any way to put aside the devastation of the impact of this outbreak , will have counteracted some of the hysteria that we have encountered . #% Infringement proceedings must be brought against any Member State that fails to transpose or implement the appropriate directives already in force in a number of Member States . #% If the law is adequate , then it must be enforced . #% Mr Harbour will be familiar with my view that as a consequence of making that central and measurable change , subject continually to examination , we will get a reverberating change of culture in the wider managerial style and operation of the House . #% Mr President , may I thank the Commissioner for that excellent and comprehensive answer , which goes a long way to reassuring me . #% What we are trying to do is good , and we need to get the right type of transport in place . #% Meanwhile , I hope that we will all inspire others with a strong vote later this week . #% If this is the way of the future , it is important that Parliament be fully involved from start to finish . #% The question was also raised of women ' s appointments . #% Also , perhaps , some thought should be given to the relationship with national parliaments . #% That is why we need to establish minimum requirements with a view to protecting workers from falls from heights . #% Why would that be ? #% Now echoes of Nazi Germany are heard as Hindus , many tens of thousands of whom I represent as a community in London , are required to identify themselves visibly in public with a yellow cloth . #% However , I served for a year as a member of a previous high-level working group on the automotive industry . #% There seems to be some lethargy on the part of the Commission when it comes to thinking through what kind of priorities we should have for foreign and security policy in the future . #% Port workers protested earlier this year at more EU interference . #% Mr President , like everyone else in this debate I should like to congratulate Mr Lannoye . #% Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies , or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe ? #% I do not know what the record is , but you have been very good . #% Poor Greece , trapped inside the modern day Völkerkerker for which it appears there is no way out ! #% This applies particularly to countries that obtain more than 50 % of their current export revenue from textiles and clothing . #% In short , everyone needs to stop flapping around like headless chickens and start examining this matter with a degree of objectivity . #% author . - Mr President , as we know , Parliament has been concerned about the situation in Bangladesh for a considerable period of time . #% There is no common EU policy on migration . #% That is an important saving in cash-strapped times , as well as being an important issue both for the people concerned and employers , who may indeed find themselves at risk of legal action if they are not taking action to prevent such injuries . #% It is kind of Mr Corbett to raise the points under Annex III of our Rules of Procedure . #% At present , a company has to seek 15 regulatory approvals for 15 different sets of disclosure documents . #% There is much about these plans and ambitions to which some of us might object , but one of the strengths of the European Union at its simplest is its role as a pole of attraction for countries that have not had the benefits of democracy , the rule of law and economic prosperity . #% For many that has become the main focus of the report . #% Very little is agreed for streamlining the red tape for legal migrants and there is an alarming absence of progressive and active engagement in how to respect diversity and have imaginative integration policies . #% It was a good question , and so far I have not heard the answer . #% We welcome the North Korean offer to engage in dialogue on all outstanding issues , which may mean that this becomes an opportunity rather than a threat . #% In the case of avian flu , with the transmission from hens to ducks to pigs to humans -- resulting in the deaths of 19 humans -- mutation is a possibility . #% Zimbabwe is a beautiful and once prosperous country with the potential to be the bread basket for the region . #% We should very firmly say to the institutions of Europe , particularly the Commission , that they should also now seize the opportunity without any further delay to endorse that code , so that we can be quite sure that Europe has the good administration it needs and deserves and which all the servants of the institutions wish to provide . #% Before I speak further , I should like the services to rule whether Amendment No 17 from the Green Group is admissible , because it seeks to rewrite the regulation . #% We have different answers across Europe . #% I hope it does not happen again . #% We have now had for a considerable period of time in the United Kingdom an over-30-month cull of all animals which have been taken out of the food chain . #% Unless we all pull together to develop rail freight on a European-wide scale -- including opening up national networks , more progress on inter-operability and changes in the way the industry thinks and works -- there will be no rail freight to defend or be worth mentioning by the year 2020 . #% We should have voted against this amendment and it was a sheer mistake on the voting list . #% I must also say that it is the position adopted by a majority in my political group as well . #% 
It seems to me quite defensive to say that you need a separate institute to ensure that gender equality remains high on the EU political agenda . #% The trouble is the predicted growth is so great as to wipe out the gains being made in reducing carbon dioxide in other sectors . #% If you start to criminalise the client in these matters , you will find that the law of unintended consequence comes into play , something at which I am afraid this Parliament is all too adept . #% We will watch carefully to see that the letter and spirit of openness is upheld in the coming months . #% Reports tell of degrading and inhuman treatment , even torture . #% There are also further concerns in paragraph 242 , concerning trade secrets . #% My final point is in answer to Mr van Dam 's contention that it is a blank cheque . #% Mr President , I beg the indulgence of the House in bringing to its attention the latest appalling developments in the case of the Bulgarian nurses imprisoned in Libya . #% Are we really that much further advanced ? #% I would like to see the area outside the Chamber deemed to be part of the Chamber so that no cameras , assistants , lobbyists or members of the public block us from reaching our offices . #% There was deadlock . #% I have a nagging worry that such intervention may not be the solution . #% What I can never understand in these situations is why a country -- and I can think of one in particular , because we had this problem in Hong Kong -- is so afraid of having its own name on a product . #% Nevertheless , it is a single , wretched , shuffling step on the journey that Europe has to take . #% They can not be put at risk for the sake for closer European political integration . #% A priority for the European Union must surely be to break out of this antagonistic mindset and instead seek , as a primary aim , to contribute to western solidarity . #% We support the rapporteur 's aims and will be supporting most of her amendments but we are not convinced that she has addressed our concerns for the environment in their entirety . #% The Commission should always be on guard to ensure that implementation takes place properly . #% That is why I urge you to reject amendments 1 and 2 . #% Without alternative jobs in rural areas young people will leave for the cities and many more people will commute daily to towns and cities with all the negative implications for the environment of increased car use on inadequate rural roads . #% We do support continued talks for peace and security in the region , we support a two-state solution and we do recognise the humanitarian issues brought about by the ongoing conflict in the region . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , beyond congratulating Mr Romeva i Rueda on his report , I would like to address the content in the wider context of the common fisheries policy . #% It is time , 41 years after the promise was first made , for the EU to honour its side of the promise and for the talks to start . #% Is it of concern for instance that the peer group review mechanism is somehow now being increasingly institutionalised and separated off as a kind of separate secretariat ? #% Only through a healthy , constructive dialogue can we root out and tackle anger and hatred . #% The Socialist Group is deeply concerned by the continuing civil war that has claimed around two million casualties over the last 19 years . #% He also talked about big money . #% Indeed the high quality of the Hong Kong civil service continues to shine through . #% That not only has an effect on Member States but also on the GNP and VAT based receipts . #% That has been a very useful process in getting a much better perception as to where the lines are weak and where we have weak implementation . #% They have made me angry -- angry that they have been let down by their experience of our internal market for financial services . #% There is a great deal more to do . #% So far the only person arrested in the Eurostat scandal has been the journalist who broke the story . #% Will the Minister commit the presidency to produce a result on the trade question within three months ? #% So far as this particular distributor is concerned , they have agreed to voluntarily withdraw from the markets where they have been contested . #% It will certainly be far more possible for them to accept a UN settlement should there be a firm prospect of membership for motherland Turkey itself . #% We therefore call upon the British Government either to produce evidence of complicity in international terrorism or to release Raghbir Singh Johal from custody forthwith . #% I was delighted that last year Member States agreed a Common List of Military Equipment to which the code applies . #% Let us never forget the human cost that this failure represents . #% My second and last point is that on the mandatory centralised procedures proposed by the Commission , the committee decided to move to a more flexible system for human medicines , but did not follow that same route in terms of animal medicines . #% It is unlikely that the proceeds of such taxes would be used to mitigate the effect of the emissions , leaving such schemes as nothing more than revenue-raising exercises . #% The text even says that we regret that it is not to be introduced in time for the next European elections , when we did not even envisage it as a possibility for the next European elections . #% Certainly when producers lobbied him in Hong Kong he got very upset and seemed not to be able to make any comment . #% The Committee on Petitions is , as has been said , the committee responsible both for relations with the European Ombudsman and for monitoring the work of the European Ombudsman . #% We also have to say that some countries are more ready to go through this last stage down the road to European Union membership than others . #% How much more frustration can be endured before a new regionalism emerges and the poorest countries are left behind ? #% However , looking to the emphasis it places on the disadvantages associated with small size and population of archipelagos and on double handicap - for example islands with mountains - it was clear there was no need for such concerns . #% I believe we are all agreed that the forthcoming ICAO general assembly meeting is going to be a key one as far as aviation and environment are concerned . #% One can say in its favour that , unlike some of its neighbours , it remains free of inter-ethnic strife and has unilaterally renounced its nuclear arsenal , as well as much of its conventional weaponry . #% That is one reason why Conservatives voted against it in April of last year , and that remains our position . #% That letter arrived after Governor Taseer 's murder . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , President Ahmadinejad 's ruthless ambition to develop nuclear weapons represents , in my view , the gravest threat to world peace today . #% I had hoped that we would get a first-reading agreement on this but this proved not to be possible . #% in writing . - I was unable to support granting discharge to the European Parliament as some concerns remained unresolved . #% I would suggest three key actions that we need to see in place if we are going to realise the potential for energy saving in existing buildings . #% The current system is , as we have repeatedly seen , unworkable , and the bureaucracy is becoming increasingly stifling . #% What I do know is that the inspectorate which we have fought for - we had to fight to get an effective budget for it , to set up the veterinary office in Brussels and to make sure that we had the principle of general inspections throughout the Community - that inspectorate finds itself threatened and bullied . #% That is what I want . #% To this Green Paper and the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos , therefore , I and my party can respond that the CFP was built on lies and that technically it is a shambles . #% Therefore , so far as his report is concerned , he is pleased to recommend adoption of the Commission proposal to the House without any further amendments . #% I hope very much that the new government in my country will not trample on Unionist wishes in its own desire to achieve a settlement but will remember that political solutions can only work if there is consent . #% Only this week the EU suspended EUR 35 million in aid to the Palestinian Authority , and rightly so , because the necessary benchmarks have not been met . #% Just who the hell do you people think you are ? #% They support proposals with these objectives in mind and therefore welcome the Commission initiative for a Rapid Reaction Facility ( or Mechanism ) , in spite of its confusing title and some unnecessarily politically-correct elements . #% I pointed out to him that the one partner on which he could firmly rely was the European Union . #% With regard to the date for the entry into force of the export ban , amendments have been tabled to bring that date forward . #% 
It is a very important point and underlies some of the disappointments that people feel about the European Union in many of our countries . #% Mr President , could I first join with some of my other colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the work that he has done this year . #% Might it not be wise at this stage , anticipating the successful outcome as you do of the negotiations , to issue an immediate invitation to President Nelson Mandela to come to the Cardiff Summit to put his personal signature on the agreements which we hope will be reached and , of course , to give him his very first opportunity to come and sample the delights that Wales , in particular , has to offer ? #% They are now depending upon the European Union to buy them time . #% We also want the US and NATO countries to prepare and make public the studies on the potentially adverse effects of LFAS which are required by law under Article 206 of the Law of the Sea . #% Now whether this is the European Union speaking , or whether it is the undue French influence on trade policy , I am not sure . #% In today 's electronic world , banks do not need large denomination notes : they are of value only to criminals . #% We , as politicians , are elected to monitor at a European level what happens . #% In terms of the budget that we will be preparing for 2010 , it is a budget which obviously is at the beginning . #% The British Conservatives hypocritically preach that others should do what they claim is done in Britain . #% From 1989 to 1990 the measures that were taken in my country were designed to protect human health . #% There were several different elections : for the presidency of the whole country ; the presidency of the Srpska republic ; the presidency of the federation ; and then also , regional elections . #% Salvaging materials is highly labour-intensive yet the work is unattractive . #% Mr President , clearly there are very real concerns about the impact of China on other players in the international trading system . #% Well , these three reports before Parliament today are a start . #% The concentration of power in , for example , the UK 's Financial Services Authority , is very daunting in itself . #% What I refer to is the issue of special security measures . #% The government of Sri Lanka and the Commission have set up the LLRC to investigate human rights allegations . #% The capital requirements will be especially burdensome to PE and venture capital . #% For instance , you say you will strive for eight or nine women Commissioners , which , of course , I support . #% The concept of putting employment in a central place in the Presidency programme is absolutely right and sets exactly the right tone and example not just for us but indeed for successive presidencies . #% The other is the rather interesting point that the civil servants in the Member States have convinced their ministers that there is a better cost-benefit for national aid going to developing countries than for aid from the European Union . #% We witnessed the welcome launch this week , by the Commissioner himself , of proposal on the internal market for services . #% It is a place where we perhaps have too many old buildings which in some cases require specialist , old fashioned , old-style paints to maintain their fabric . #% Even if not everyone from such countries can be judged refugees under the strict Geneva Convention criteria , but only as escaping mere misery , there is no call to demonise them . #% There will be no fish left in the Mediterranean by then , but people will still be able to eat sushi if they can afford the bill . #% Secondly , the Commission shares responsibility for donor mobilisation with the World Bank and at that July conference of donors over EUR 2 billion was pledged . #% There need to be clear markers on the ways in which a system of non-discriminatory interconnection and oversight of the gateways of broadband broadcasting and other systems can be operated in the public interest . #% He is quite right to say that certain types of consular services are provided in Mecca during the Hajj by the UK Government for British Muslims . #% The official estimate of the number of prisoners affected in this specific area and this specific instance is 300 , rather than 700 . #% May we see them ? #% All EU countries operate blanket exclusions against people with diabetes in certain posts , but the range of excluded occupations varies widely . #% One of the key issues with structural funding is making sure that we deliver regional and structural funding on time . #% I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices , eternal vigilance , not just outside our borders but within . #% Oil-seed rape and wheat can be used in the production of biofuels whether diesel or petrol and save on CO2 release . #% It is disgraceful that their resting place has been treated in this way . #% The sum involved is small but it is important . #% It would be a shame if the report were to go down . #% It is being finalised literally now , so that it can be available in the proper form at the time promised . #% This is a very dangerous proposal ; it has been exploited by certain governments - including my own - to expel people who are protesting about the denial of human rights and the very serious problems in certain countries in the world which have obnoxious , racist and militaristic regimes . #% An attempt is now being made to include terrorist attacks in the list of supposedly natural disasters covered by the fund . #% As a rapporteur , it is important to listen - something politicians are often accused of not doing ! #% The amendment on Article 14 would prevent the confusing situation where minced beef - marketed for example , in Austria , Mr Fischler - which was derived from Polish animals imported live into Austria , could be labelled ` prepared in Austria ' . #% As Mr Amato said , there is nothing quite as complex as simplification . #% So let us use the EU-wide legal base we have to provide greater protection for all our workers . #% Mr President , the Commission 's proposal for a ban on the testing of cosmetics on animals - but only within the European Union - is totally inadequate . #% The Belgian Presidency rightly included action against paramilitaries as one of its four priorities in Colombia , in August of this year . #% EU support for Fair Trade through consumer awareness and information campaigns can help Fair Trade grow across the whole of Europe . #% It means we want to see real benefits for the local communities and assurances that this agreement will not have negative impacts on the local populations that depend on fisheries . #% He can be assisted by the democratically elected representatives of the people in ensuring that his work in combating maladministration in the European Community is supported strongly . #% The OSCE is rapidly usurping the Council of Europe as the principal and most relevant forum for discussing democracy - with its ODIHR branch supporting election monitoring - human rights and the rule of law in Europe . #% Russia maintains that Moldova , as a former Soviet Republic , is in its sphere of influence . #% The point about safety has been well made . #% It is 15 years since Aung San Suu Kyi was first put under house arrest and 14 years since the SPDC decided to disregard the will of the Burmese people as expressed in the 1990 elections . #% With the plethora of new TV channels , with digital TV , have we got anywhere with a Parliamentary TV channel ? #% In the United Kingdom , even when a vacancy occurs mid-term in the European Parliament , we do not take the next Member on a party list ; we have a by-election . #% This industry has also created hundreds of jobs for local people in the impoverished country . #% Hence Parliament 's demand for a convention of the Council , not just a forum . #% He failed to do that in his answer . #% I believe we should learn the lessons from that mistake of the past and realise that the importance of this particular enlargement , the re-uniting of the European family , is something which our public at home needs to be made aware of while the IGC is actually taking place . #% On balance -- just -- it is worse to reject it than to support it and for a Conservative that is a good enough reason to vote for it . #% It does not strip consumers of their pre-existing rights . #% I am particularly concerned that , at a time when questions are being asked about the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of the USA , similar searching questions are missing from our debate concerning the ECB . #% I have always said that Member States should work towards including children in mainstream education wherever possible , but , at the same time , recognising that some children may not thrive in that atmosphere , especially if there is no proper back-up . #% We must look towards common solutions to Europe 's problems , whilst respecting the choice of each EU Member State by allowing them to decide how we progress . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , thank you very much to Mr Kaczmarek and to the Commissioner for his response to the report . #% 
Altogether we are happy that the EU and Mexico have reached an agreement but we do not believe that the UK should be bound by it . #% I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his answer . #% However , we have to encourage investment in the backbone capacity that will carry these services and encourage people to develop the new services that will take advantage of that increased capacity . #% I hope that the Commission will respond supportively , constructively and imaginatively . #% We have pushed forward the issue of developing economic and trade links with Pakistan . #% Our approach was to ensure that all candidates gave a commitment to price stability and independence and , indeed , all six candidates fulfilled that obligation . #% The thrust of the report is not to make concrete proposals , but to lay down guidelines for the next Parliament . #% Those are principles that I not only agreed with at the time , together with my colleagues in the Commission , but have actively been seeking to put into effect ever since . #% In particular , I want to stress the importance of the amendment to remove the reference in the report and in the Commission proposals to the right of Member States to expel third country nationals , not only if they represent a threat to public order or public security but also if they represent a threat to Member States ' international relations . #% The difficulty of policing illegal immigrants is damaging to this process and must be resolved soon . #% I want to raise something with the Presidency which was in the small print of her remarks . #% I have to say this question was tabled in the first flush of joy after learning in the press about this rather unexpected inclusion of the protocol which many people in this House have been arguing for for such a long time but , I suspect , could hardly believe would actually happen . #% Mr President , last week in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly we unanimously adopted a resolution on coffee . #% Secondly , a point addressed to the Council . #% Unfortunately , both the EU and national financing schemes tend to be complex . #% While the Tories are taking time off trying to heal their splits , Labour is hard at work making Brussels work for Britain . #% We on this side of the House support the idea of true and honest cost-benefit assessments that take account of all the costs and benefits . #% I want to see it as an opportunity for countries outside the European Union to be able to be proud of what they produce , providing it is produced -- and here I totally agree with the Commissioner -- to the same standards that we have within the European Union . #% I expect to see a better relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the interest of all the countries in the southern Mediterranean area . #% The petitioners have stated that Greece has not properly implemented Directive 83/182/EEC , which concerns conditions for the exemption of certain taxes and excise duties for EU citizens who are -- and that is key -- in another Member State . #% We therefore welcome the fact that since June 2005 Tunisia 's authorities have allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross access to prisons . #% Finally , the allocation of money for research should always be informed by a consideration for the environment . #% As everyone in this House knows , relations between India and Pakistan have been very difficult over the last few months , and since both countries are nuclear powers it is very important for this dialogue to be successful . #% The Commission is supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties . #% At the trialogue which was held yesterday evening between 9 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. , an agreement was reached between the representatives of Parliament and the Council that Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 should be adopted as quickly as possible , as already approved by the Council . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would like to support the EPP 's proposal for postponement on the vote . #% I ask Council to press this specific case , rather than just make generalized condemnations . #% I know that we have cumbersome procedures but that can not be the only reason . #% For those particular uses , two-stroke technology is the only viable option . #% Mr President , I want to speak for a few moments on the Ludford report on countering racism in the European Union . #% If companies comply with that , they should be entitled to apply for contracts . #% I find myself having to play down those difficulties . #% That has to be a key element . #% It is perhaps the most important security challenge facing us in the next century . #% Depending on the result of that , my point is that I am proposing a separate vote on the original text . #% I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Graça Moura 's report . #% But in the European Parliament , for instance , I think I am right in saying that out of the ten directors only one is a woman . #% I am fearful at the moment that we are seeing those predictions come true . #% Finally it is unjustifiable that LDCs should live up to EU production standards . #% I would like to congratulate President Kim Dae-Jung of the Republic of Korea on his commitment to the sunshine policy which will allow the normalisation of inter-Korean relations and welcome Kim Jong Il 's positive response . #% I hope that he personally , along with the Quaestors , will play his role in ensuring this . #% I apologise for the confusion we have had in committee over the voting and I am glad that it has all been resolved now . #% It will ensure a uniform and harmonized level of safety requirements whilst also avoiding distortion of competition . #% We are not sure anyway how an amendment will support the Dutch case , since it does not amend the current legislation . #% That is highly unlikely to happen unless we are given the time to examine them effectively . #% We welcome too their cooperation in relation to the seminar . #% The report also provides information on EU instruments and initiatives in third countries , for example , the EU 's human rights dialogues with China and Iran , and the new human rights consultations established during 2005 with Russia . #% Mr President , following on Mr Fayot 's very fair presentation , I would like to withdraw my Amendment No 4 in the interests of Amendment No 10 , which has been put forward by Mr Nordmann . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - How will the AIFM Directive , aimed at alternative investment fund managers , restore confidence in the financial sector when the problem is with the big commercial banks ? #% They are trying to put through an anti-terrorism bill with a derogation from the ECHR in order to detain suspects without a proper trial , with no legal representation , no judicial review and without being able to hear the evidence given by the intelligence services . #% The first signal that this report makes is that some of the Commission 's proposals do not quite go far enough . #% The sad fact is that , although this particular disease affects only animals , it can be transmitted by air over a distance of some 200 kilometres and therefore any Member State within the European Union and beyond is vulnerable . #% All the innovation that the industry is coming forward with will fail to develop properly if no spectrum is available and if the industry is blocked from operating across the European market of 500 million people . #% My second and last point relates to the reduction of cyclamate levels . #% Member States can not be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private . #% Mr President , the Indonesian Government must formally put on record its opposition to human rights violations such as unlawful killings , including extra-judicial executions , disappearances and torture . #% They affect anyone who actually becomes vulnerable either by the use of badly treated blood which is often contaminated and passed on , unsafe sex and the bad use of needles to list just some examples . #% The SOLVIT system is , after all , simple , pragmatic and practical -- surely an example of the best sort of thing we do , rather than being overly legalistic . #% In order to advance the immediate aims of the Marco Polo Programme - those of improving the environmental performance of freight transport and reducing road congestion , albeit in a relatively small way - this lowering of subsidy thresholds is crucial . #% A heritage denied , ignored or distorted leaves a society divorced from reality , its true nature and character still oppressed , still deprived of its birthright . #% Well , they may be pleased but they certainly will not be loved by the people of Europe . #% I fear though that it has not been possible to get to a compromise which would enable us on this side to support the report in its present form . #% I voted against the Rapkay report because I consider that the final text did not provide adequate support for services of general interest ( public services ) . #% My group will uphold the committee agreement by voting for an opt-out system on directories to be possible . #% It is sometimes easy to forget that mutual recognition of professional qualifications within the European single market has been one of the foundation stones of the whole of the internal market project . #% 
There is a good deal of uncertainty about a number of things : the cost of the equipment , which the small trader will need . #% Mr President , could I first of all thank Mrs Paulsen for the constructive way in which she has conducted the dialogue between the groups to come up with some compromise amendments ? #% This is not a position , in all friendship to our colleagues in the PSE , which we are able to accept . #% However , we do not support calls for an EU legal base and further directives ( as in paragraphs 10 , 11 and 27 ) to address the problem . #% Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance , assistance to victims and related activities . #% There is a new twist : a French ski school has sought to employ 15 British ski instructors and has been prevented from doing so . #% Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission 's - it was the decision of this Parliament ! #% Today we express our deep concern at Peru 's long-standing failure to heed international protests against so-called faceless courts , which remain totally unacceptable to the international community . #% I am aware that my friend and colleague Reimer Böge said that , of course , in the grand order of things it is not a great deal of money . #% We are not talking here about cuts in social security ; that is not the point . #% Commissioner , I am proud that the EU 's single biggest external aid programme is its contribution to the Palestinian authority . #% We should like to congratulate Ruth Hieronymi on her diligence in the many public hearings , which included the appropriate regulatory and commercial interests from the United Kingdom , and on her producing a balanced , practicable and enduring piece of work incorporating many improvements suggested by colleagues . #% Not least we support the need to have a comprehensive round because if the round is as broad as possible , we will be able to make progress in the end . #% The European Union has long been deeply concerned with Central America , for instance through the San José process . #% We therefore support the Commission 's demands to have more rights to negotiate , for example , the open sky agreements . #% It took us quite some time to find out what was actually being said by the learned individuals concerned . #% As others have said , it has been a concern in a number of Member States for many years and of particular concern for EU residents who travel , let alone those who reside in places like the United Kingdom or Ireland . #% We have heard about synergies ; we want to see them . #% I hope the House will think very closely before supporting that amendment . #% There is no clause which will check whether asylum seekers are being left destitute , equal rights are being denied to gay and lesbian people , or ethnic minority people are being abused . #% Politically , I fundamentally object to the driving motive of EU accession to ECHR as ' a move forward in the process of European integration [ involving ] one further step towards political union ' . #% The European Council is our first chance to step forward decisively from this introspective period of reflection and start to do some serious politics . #% However , I believe that political pressure should never be allowed to interfere with artistic decisions . #% I am sure it can justify those figures . #% I , for one at least , am not in favour of that because I believe it is old-fashioned , illiberal , reactionary and , in its longer-term effect , philistine . #% It can be used by smaller interests to counteract the power of international company interest . #% We have to get away from this idea that sustainable growth somehow means 3 % year after year , if that is going to eat up our finite resources and pollute our environment . #% If you think you have a mandate for that , you are a disgrace and a scoundrel . #% ... will realise that it also owes a duty to senior and often ill Members of this House who have given a lot of service , and that those Members are prepared to pay to be in an insurance scheme which is more than any of us , as present Members , are prepared to do . #% The Commission has powers in these areas which we believe should and must be extended . #% There are other ways of tracing the origins of honey , as well as the pollen content to which the rapporteur has referred . #% All the companies who own the lorries and other vehicles and all carriers of all types must take responsibility for their actions - corporate responsibility from the top downwards . #% Europol should be used to prevent the free movement of people who have been convicted of football-related crimes to ensure that they do not cause the same kind of trouble as at previous World Cup and European championship tournaments . #% We have seen the external value of the euro plummet . #% However , we are now witnessing the erosion of the traditional communities and destruction of our landscape due to the total disregard for sensible and locally acceptable planning developments . #% Mr President , those countries used to Roman and Napoleonic law have to accept that the state governs their lives , but in Britain any such idea is an abomination . #% We agree on the need to support the guidelines process to ensure common themes underlie the programmes in each of our countries , and the need for a full consultation on those guidelines by the European Commission . #% He is right to flag the need for better education and right to raise the importance of increased funding by central government in this regard . #% For the first amendment , which I put down under the Rule which requires 29 signatures , I got 43 without any difficulty from four political groups . #% It is up to farmers to follow the legislation through . #% Also involved are the identical Amendments 4 , 19 and 23 , tabled by the Socialist and ALDE Groups . #% There are the Doorn and the Frassoni reports , one focusing on lawmaking and subsidiarity , the other on monitoring the application of the law . #% So I can say that the Socialists and Democrats Group is very keen to work with the rapporteur ; we do support the proposals for these guidelines , and we look forward next week to discussing the estimates . #% There is no doubt that we need to promote how safe chicken meat is , especially when properly cooked . #% First , intermodality and the need to optimise infrastructure links to the hinterland . #% In conclusion , we wish , as a group , to be able to be principled and responsible in this budget process . #% However , it is rather complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech solutions , while China simply does the manufacturing . #% We will do our best to deal with that , but I suspect that , if there are problems , we will get the blame in public opinion for a decision that was taken by the governments . #% That is the only issue that we ought to concentrate on now and , perhaps with some slight regret , we feel that Parliament ' s position needs to be slimmed down to Mr Pirker ' s points on comitology . #% I would also add that it would be very unhelpful , as Mr Aldonas at the Department of Commerce in the United States has suggested , for the US to link this steel dispute to the wider issue of problems in the global economy . #% It has one of the highest levels of complaints in the Solvit mechanism that we very much support at member government level . #% The initial results of that exercise relating to damage in housing and local infrastructure were issued at the conference arranged by the Commission and World Bank donors last July . #% That too has been slowly becoming more effective and , if not taking on powers , at least becoming more influential . #% Clinging on to outdated concepts does not help ; strengthening the role of the social partners simply leads to more paralysis . #% Mr President , I too congratulate the rapporteur on the report which he will present to us tomorrow . #% We have watched with interest the development of the budgetary process so far and we thank the two rapporteurs who have produced a good report along the right lines . #% Mr President , as others have already suggested , the facts speak for themselves . #% I am also pleased that the scare about the threat to corporate government standards has been dispelled . #% I have abstained on this report . #% Even ship pilots ' proper concerns over safety have met with indifference . #% Yet Romania has concerns that her own entry date may somehow be held up by the energy and commitment that we are putting into the first ten . #% I suggest two solutions . #% I have some reservations with regard to proposals to allow the use of common or generic names without , in addition , the full names or details of the substance . #% If we actually started that and sorted it out locally , as the fishing dispute has been pretty well sorted out locally between those two communities , tensions would disappear very quickly . #% First of all , on the issue of retrospectivity . #% The way forward still lies largely in our own backyard . #% 
Legislation has been brought forward piecemeal . #% Finally , how soon will these proposed missions take place ? #% I commend Mrs Berès 's report to this House . #% The German finance minister , Dr Schäuble seems to have opened the door to a new round of integration leading to a fiscal union and , ultimately , a political union . #% Moreover , competition over tax rates and tax bases between national authorities is actually a good thing for business and economic growth -- witness the general reductions in company tax over the past few years . #% The Commissioner has already commented that women 's rights in certain areas of the country are under assault , but I say this is also happening at central government level . #% We had great difficulty in the Committee on Culture , as we have had across the board . #% The swift commitment of support to projects like that offered by the Maritime Rescue Institute in Stonehaven , Scotland , is just one example , and it is much more directly in tune with Parliament 's earlier call . #% Precision in language most of all : the word `` contamination '' is not satisfactory when it is used in the phraseology of the food authority proposals , which we will be discussing shortly . #% That is why we are not rushing . #% Facts like these only begin to illustrate how far matters of location alone can place islands at a competitive disadvantage . #% When it costs # 100m for a new aircraft , this is nonsense . #% Mr President , I want to draw Members ' attention to a set of pan-European scams which target small businesses . #% For that reason , we do not believe that it is appropriate at this time to call for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons . #% We need to reform , update and simplify our procedures . #% There are many cases in the existing Treaties - different protocols , parts of the European Coal and Steel Treaty for instance - that are amendable by simplified procedure and the IGC should look constructively at this . #% She has been kept under house arrest since September 2000 and has not been allowed to move about freely for 13 years . #% It showed how important this directive is and I thank him very much for that . #% I wonder from my experience in Skopje whether we have not gone too far in bypassing the competence of the local Commission delegation . #% My delegation has placed at the entrance to the Chamber a book of condolence , in which we hope colleagues throughout Parliament will feel free to put their memories of Phillip . #% Therefore , I would like to have clear assurances , with regard to the new arrangements , that first of all the new Agency with these wider and different roles will be objective , that it will behave in a sensitive manner and not allow any politics to enter into its work . #% I understand that , as you said , no agreement was reached . #% Mr President , I would just like to ask the President-in-Office if he would please be so kind as to answer my question regarding the importance of benchmarks by which we will judge the transition process in Nigeria . #% It will also take cost out of businesses and will help businesses do things differently . #% On the second occasion I was able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi clandestinely . #% Madam President , I begin by declaring an interest as the joint president of the Hong Kong Friendship Group , joint , that is , as with my good friend and colleague , Mr De Clercq , from the ELDR Group . #% However , there will be no surprise that we will reject those amendments that have been put down in the name of certain members of the TDI Group . #% First , not only have we ensured that urban poverty and neglect are dealt with directly for the first time , but against all expectations we have retained an urban community initiative too , which can target the small - and medium-sized towns which currently receive less than 10 % of the funding . #% The sole objective of this regulation is , clearly , climate protection . #% He represented the best tradition of Pakistan - a devout Muslim but not in any way fundamentalist . #% I am certainly in favour of free movement in the EU where legal status exists , but what of the applicant states and their borders - they will have to take over protection of the EU under Schengen ? #% There is a gulf of mutual incomprehension between the EU and the US . #% To my mind , the European Union should focus more precisely on some achievable objectives where it has leverage . #% There are very few people in the Chamber who were here at that time , but I can still see one or two officials from those days . #% This is an opportunity to explore their commitment to working in partnership with Parliament and embracing positively our concerns to scrutinise the implementation of the reform process and also their constructive engagement with our concerns as Members for a European economy based on knowledge , skills and creativity and a European society based on inclusion , diversity and cultural wealth . #% Secondly , throughout these talks we will be very much in the public eye . #% However , we have abstained on this report since in places it is over-detailed and prescriptive , and where it does propose specific measures it is far from clear that these would help Member States to develop a coherent and consistent anti-discrimination policy . #% In the next ten years 45 million children will die of poverty-related diseases , 12 million AIDS orphans will be produced in Africa , and 100 million children will remain totally illiterate . #% These may be only allegations , but they are made by Mr van Buitenen and should be listened to . #% But long-term investment in properly targeted development assistance seems not to enjoy that same priority . #% As for the future , I wish you well when you start the conciliation negotiations . #% In his statement of 12 October 2005 , the Commissioner did not mention the importation and trafficking of wild birds . #% I will read Amendment No 9 to the House . #% My final point is this question of winning at all costs . #% That is extremely important as part of Parliament 's approach to property policy . #% Mr President , the furore over the Danish cartoons rages in Europe and worldwide . #% Mr President , Rule 34 of Parliament 's Rules of Procedure states that the debate on a motion of censure shall not take place until at least 24 hours after its receipt is announced to Members . #% I have two questions : should random testing not be considerably increased in order to increase the certainty of detection and , similarly , what technical improvements are required to remove all doubt ? #% I am very pleased that they are going to be brought in line with the working time directive . #% However , there are potential dangers for developing countries in this revision ; one country that has been mentioned already is Sri Lanka . #% It is very aggravating when the Council of Ministers and individual governments wring their hands about the low turnout in European elections , launch campaigns with balloons and plastic bags about people 's Europe and seek to win citizens ' votes in referendum campaigns , but still maintain obstructive red tape when those citizens have the cheek to assert their European legal right to move freely . #% As we enlarge , the Charter succeeds in spelling out for all concerned why fundamental rights are so salient to bringing Europe closer to the citizen . #% But it appears from comments being made by one of the Vice-Presidents of this Parliament in the newspapers and not to this House , that the whole issue is now not regarded as important by the Bureau . #% There is much anecdotal evidence in the UK that large amounts of illegal meat are still entering the country . #% Will she take that back to the Council of Ministers , raise it with her French colleagues in particular , and answer me , perhaps in writing later , unless she is able to do so today , about what can be done to ensure that these older pilots ' jobs are made safe . #% In respect of this legislation , I note that the proposal conforms to the provisions of the Montreal and Warsaw Conventions . #% If large corporations and large enterprises are losing people , making people redundant and laying people off , it may well be up to the smaller outfits - the SMEs - to pick up this slack and to actually go out there and create employment for those who can work in this sector . #% While I have and will continue to support demands for an immediate halt to further extension of the settlements - or rather their dismantling - and no further building of the wall , I feel it does not fit well here , where we are essentially dealing with a very different issue . #% The objective of this proposal , as the rapporteur has stated , is to lay down harmonized conditions under which nonresident carriers may operate national coach and bus services within a Member State . #% The EU has added more than GBP 200 per annum to the average UK gas bill . #% For many years this Parliament and the Committee on Budgets have fought for the rights and the prerogatives of this institution . #% We believe , however , that our law enforcement authorities need to be able to use adequate tools for them to carry out their tasks effectively , of which profiling , particularly intelligence-led profiling , is one . #% It obviously makes it attractive for counterfeiters , if they are going to counterfeit notes , to counterfeit large denomination notes , rather than smaller denomination notes and I am slightly concerned that this very large note will , if you want , make the euro the counterfeiter 's currency of choice . #% I shall give a couple of quotes . #% Further work needs to be done to guarantee the rights of Russian-speaking minorities in Estonia and Latvia . #% I do not yet know whether Mr Sawyer has or has not agreed to accede to my request to withdraw the code of practice . #% 
I would like to be able to take a robust first amendment position on this as has been upheld in the courts in the United States . #% I just wish to say that the Commission has already announced its intention in the 1998 to 2000 social action programme to launch a debate on the use of the future Article 13 . #% That seems to be entirely inconsistent and is also an issue that was covered by the Gambelli case . #% We want the best possible relations with Indonesia but these can only be achieved on the basis of a very considerable improvement in the sphere of human rights . #% With these and with proper labelling the consumer can exercise a safe , free and informed choice . #% We are being deprived because we have no explanation of how he voted on the Plan Colombia . #% Macedonia as a candidate has waited long and patiently for accession negotiations to start . #% We need direct action and we need it now . #% It is inevitable that within the EU and , to an even greater degree , in the EU applicant states the number of jobs in agriculture will fall as a result of mechanization . #% Joint investigation teams will allow two or more countries to join together for the purposes of investigating terrorism , human trafficking , drug trafficking and indeed other serious organised crime . #% The resolution which the US is currently trying to get through the Security Council is not designed to avert war but rather to provoke war . #% It should also mean avoiding the use of public funds , for example in information policy , where EU-financed actions could replace viable , ongoing private initiatives . #% Support one part without taking into account the needs of the other and you can create damaging distortions , which is exactly what has happened . #% I am surprised that she was surprised . #% It is also the case , as others have said , that employment , environment and labour rights need to be an integral part of the process , not bolted on as some kind of afterthought . #% There are , after all , rocks with natural radioactivity close to beaches and we do not want everyone to have to go swimming with a Geiger counter in their swimming trunks , or indeed swimming trunks that turn black if they meet any radioactivity ! #% Such is the grip of EU money that dissent from the perceived wisdom is treated almost as heresy . #% Then we need to help with bringing the guilty to justice and the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission . #% Initiatives like duty - and quota-free access for LDCs , special and differential treatment , and aid for trade can not be held up in an agricultural silo by more advanced developing countries , especially when the offer on the table is the most substantive ever made by the EU . #% We need to work with the Commissioner to ensure the good work he does and the good work we do with him can be implemented for the safety of the traveling public . #% My reservations lie in the section addressed by Paragraph 13 of Mr Lannoye 's report , where we are calling on the Commission to notify us by the end of this year of the measures taken to ensure that useful substances which have low toxicity levels , and appear on Priority Lists 3 and 4 , which have not been notified because of a limited commercial interest , or of high evaluation costs , may be so evaluated with the help of an appropriate restricted data package . #% Worst of all , the financial regulation has been split from the trade regulation , which is by far the most important part of the package . #% I just wondered , following Mr Bertens ' third question on follow-up work , whether the Council is aware of the large level of publicity that was generated on this very subject by the visit to Angola with the Red Cross of a former member of the British Royal Family , Princess Diana . #% It is also condescending for this Parliament to seek to impose restrictions on others , while excluding executives , MEPs and Commissioners . #% Finally I want to express support for the small disability organisations for blind and people , or people with intellectual disabilities . #% In my previous life I was managing director of a snack food company that made tortilla chips . #% I have on two occasions raised an issue in this Chamber during the course of discussions such as this and it has been incorrectly minuted . #% I know some of you were also concerned that we went too far in seeking to ensure that Member States did not undermine the level of transparency the regulation aims at . #% Now a large majority of people , and indeed all travel agents , have access to the internet , and I agree with the previous speakers who have said we have a duty to ensure fairness and equal access to the market and , as Commissioner Mandelson said , fair rules , effective rules , and protect the consumers and ensure competition . #% I raise this point in working Document No 4 for the Budget Committee and again draw this to your attention , particularly because Dublin has lost some ECU 1 million in exchange rate losses in the year 1996 . #% We believe , therefore , that the committee has done a good job in tightening the legal requirements surrounding this and making it clear that detention is not imprisonment when you have been accused of no crime . #% In fact , they feel as though their national identity is being forgotten . #% Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Larive on her report and welcome it on behalf of the European People 's Party . #% I think there are many people not only in this House but beyond who would think that issues to do with criminal cooperation , drugs , tackling drug smuggling and protection of privacy are rather important matters to have on-the-spot inspections about . #% Conclusion two reads : ` in response to the Fukushima accident , the UK nuclear power industry has reacted responsibly and appropriately , displaying leadership for safety and a strong safety culture in its response to date ' . #% For example , the crime rate is lower than in Germany , the detection rate higher . #% Mr President , I want to concentrate on one area only . #% That is our fault . #% 40 % of EU trade is already by sea or inland waterway . #% The report has not only looked at contracting industries in the building sector but looked across a wide spectrum of people working at heights . #% The House knows very well the difficulty we have been having concerning some of the social programmes insofar as the use of Article 235 is concerned . #% Frankly the Convention is staggering and may stall completely should the Feira Council fail to bring a fresh stimulus . #% What conditions would need to be satisfied to restore the Association Agreement ? #% At 21 she is seven years younger than I was when I went to the House of Commons . #% But sadly , CETA does come up with some other demands and political goals which we find deeply worrying . #% I have no doubt , therefore , that a single regime for prospectuses can create benefits for all , greater choice and higher returns for investors , lower costs of capital and funding opportunities for companies . #% I hope that custom will also be emulated . #% Once again this is a year in which it has failed to manage and control the Community 's budget properly . #% And how are you monitoring that Member States are carrying out their duties under this code properly ? #% I have three supplementary questions . #% In the bold new Europe , even nature has to be standardised . #% Nonetheless , we should support this report and I once again congratulate Ana Miranda on all she has done . #% My group thinks that in combination with a number of other factors , Mrs Myller 's report which is to follow for example , it is possible to put a little more into this proposal than we see already . #% Prior to the result of such an impact assessment , I flatly reject proposals for a blanket 0.05 % FTT on all financial transactions as being arbitrary and ill thought-out . #% What is more , will he take back to the further discussions in the Council the advantages of untying aid ? #% But it is when it comes to Ireland that I really get interested . #% Your appearance will put off other diners . '' #% As far as I know this decision has not yet been taken and , therefore , we need to be clear about what we are trying to do in these debates . #% In this report Parliament has significantly improved the Commission 's proposal and it is one that I can fully recommend to this House . #% What must be recognised is that the European Union 's integration agenda is one of the greatest threats to the heritage of every country in Europe that we have seen for decades . #% I am glad that Thessaloniki rejected the preposterous suggestion that all EU asylum seekers should be driven back towards the Third World or EU fringe countries . #% We hope it will not be his last time for presenting this report to Parliament as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets , but there may be life after 2004 . #% It is pathetic that Javier Solana and Gijs de Vries are obliged to come to us and say , ` we do not believe there have been any violations , but we do not have the competence to ask Member States the relevant questions ' . #% The intention is that I will be the parliamentary representative on 19 June , as an observer , to which I look forward . #% One set of papers from mid-2003 actually dismisses rumours of planned restructuring . #% It is particularly difficult , Colleagues , when Mr Bangemann was a former Member of this Parliament and indeed , a leader of the Liberal Group . #% 
He wrongly expected the same reaction as shown by the EU to the flawed election the previous year in Azerbaijan . #% The act which brought my private life to public attention was one of extraordinary foolishness . #% We all condemn the violence taking place in Sri Lanka and we all bemoan the loss of life . #% We agreed that in order to be useful , we would need to prioritise the issues that we focussed on very rigorously . #% With regards to combating terrorism , we have supported the more constructive and forward-looking language in amendments 55 and 56 , which acknowledge that there has been progress in decreasing the levels of infiltration by militant groups , but that further action needs to be taken in parallel with meaningful demilitarisation . #% In my case , I live with diabetes . #% ESDP is not about sharing the defence burden , it is not about strengthening the European pillar of Nato . #% Mr President , this is an extremely bad directive . #% To what extent would the Commissioner agree with me that the origins of the current crisis in Macedonia actually lie purely and simply with the activities of criminal gangs looking to protect their smuggling rackets and taking advantage of the weak security of the border with FYROM , and that what we need to do is to tighten up on those criminals who have used the issue of minority rights as fuel to keep the fires of discontent going in order to cover up their activities ? #% Science is crucial , so is independence - that is why the siting of this authority is important . #% In concrete terms , that means that , in my constituency for example , a feed plant which at the moment is producing feed for ruminants will be able at the same time to manufacture feed for pigs and poultry . #% There is a distinction at the moment between the EU and the US and we hope we can move forward together , but if we can not we will have to move forward separately , because the direction we are going is the right one . #% Unless we do that in November or December we will be having a similar debate about Indonesia , telling each other how we knew it was all going to end in tears . #% Again , we are very pleased to see that the bond market is going to be given distinctive treatment , which reflects the differences between the bonds and the securities market . #% There are two issues which must be of concern . #% The IRA is different from ETA , which is different from al-Qa ` ida , but they are all evil and must be faced down and eliminated . #% My distinguished colleague , Professor Tim Congdon , has written a pamphlet on this . #% I have always believed that foreign military intervention should only take place in the national interests of the nation-states concerned , yet the serious deterioration and spiralling violence in the region demand action and meet the test of the new ethical foreign policy of which Portugal is a full Member State . #% But do not be naive - the rejection of this directive will not prevent experiments in biotechnology . #% I should like quickly to cover a matter that we hold dear in my political group -- the question of value for money . #% I accept the need for the ban on arms . #% I personally regret the decision to apply this directive only to third-country nationals and stateless persons , thus removing the EU Member States from its scope , and I shall be voting for the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group to that effect . #% The rapporteur in his introduction said that the objective is to implement the Dublin Convention and have a system of fingerprinting . #% There is no more urgent task for international diplomacy than to work with Russian and China to isolate Sudan and impose a UN presence in Darfur . #% Would the Commissioner accept that is a suitable target and a suitable deadline ? #% And the European Union , as a multinational organisation of fifteen developed democracies , clearly has a duty as well as a significant role to play in all the global efforts to promote democratisation , sustainable development and peaceful progress . #% Mr President , I refer to an item in the Minutes concerning my report on ferry safety . #% I am not in favour of early closure of safe nuclear plants , but my enthusiasm for new plants is extremely limited . #% Let me refer now to Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 . #% I have seen a list of more than 3 400 people who , in the last 10 years , have died under torture in that regime for their religious convictions . #% Although the British Conservatives support cultural and linguistic rights for ethnic minorities , including Hungarian minorities , throughout the EU , we are concerned that invoking the principle of subsidiarity and self-governance for the Hungarian minority in Romania could set a precedent for forcing Member States to abandon their unitary constitutional arrangements . #% I would like to point out to my colleague that the Treaty of Amsterdam refers to ending discrimination not only against women but against a whole range of minorities on the basis of race , ethnicity , sexual orientation , disability . #% Starting this week , you will be spending large amounts of taxpayers ' money telling people what they should think and how they should vote . #% You will be aware that the whole question about the implementation provisions will not be in force in the United Kingdom until about April of next year . #% So it is important that the health and safety risks are taken on board . #% If Europe has fallen into line with the principle of culling animals over 30 months , is that in itself enough ? #% After several high-level meetings last year , the Moroccans eventually agreed to enter into an informal dialogue on re-admission . #% Mr President , my party fully recognises the need for the developed countries to make available resources for international crises and for our response to be rapid and effective . #% Perhaps I might ask Mr Fischler if there is any progress made in this direction . #% The Tories pretend to be against unlimited immigration at home , but here they support giving the right of entry into Britain to an additional 94 million people . #% Mr Bösch has tabled a number of amendments from the point of view of a critical friend , regarding OLAF , the Anti-Fraud Office . #% In the defence industries in the last few years we have had considerable cross-border cooperation and consolidation but we have not helped those companies because we have not provided them with a single company structure . #% That means improvements in working conditions and working hours on board ship . #% They share a small cell with three other prisoners . #% It will not cost the tax-payers an arm and a leg : just EUR 83 million per year , if our committee position is accepted - a tiny sum for a massive challenge . #% We need to congratulate where there is good work , and encourage good practice to spread across every department , DG and institution . #% I disagree with Mrs Wallis ' suggestion that , because of some criticism from David Byrne of the result reached in the Legal Affairs Committee , we should give way now . #% I would also like to thank the Belgian Presidency for their work , as some of my previous colleagues have said , and also Mr Gauzès and the other shadow rapporteurs . #% As and when this Council regulation is imposed , will it improve the situation or will France continue to play wing three-quarters with its illegal immigrants ? #% Please do not be scared that by not granting discharge you will cause this Commission to fall . #% Believe me , colleagues , I have had no shortage of people wanting to complicate this text , wanting to add extra provisions . #% Opt-in is superficially pro-consumer , but you would have to prove that you never opted in , which is actually more difficult . #% We will be looking carefully to see precisely what is contained there and whether Mr Blair ditches his previous commitments in protecting the British rebate . #% It does not go as far as I hoped , but it does go further than I expected , as Parliament and the Swedish Presidency dragged the Commission and Council far closer to our position than they ever expected to be . #% So the EU should remember Third World countries outside the EU where its funds would be put to better use . #% There is a potential for trouble here but there also is a potential for much good for the consumer . #% These would have been the people who made all the laws . #% We therefore voted against Paragraph 3 and Recital F. #% It is a serious matter and it needs to be dealt with in a serious way and I am sure there are views on both sides on this , but to tie it into a general set of negotiations and discussions , when critical issues have to be decided for the future of our continent , would seem to me totally inappropriate . #% There is no evidence that the Americans are treating them cruelly or inhumanely , and we should support them rather than engage in speculative and ill-informed criticism . #% My constituency of half a million people is approximately three-quarters from the mainland of Hampshire and one-quarter from the Isle of Wight . #% There is no more scientific evidence . #% The Commission has recently stated once again that EU citizens should be able to move between Member States on terms similar to those applicable to nationals of a Member State , and that additional administrative or legal obligations should be kept to the bare minimum required by the fact that the person in question is a non-national . #% NGOs have forged a greater role for themselves in the WTO negotiations on the basis that they represent civil society , but do they ? #% Mr President , you may have an appointment somewhere else later on , I do not know , but we are here to do a job and to vote . #% It was a great shame in fact that the Belgian police overreacted in such a way by clearing bars of decent ordinary football-loving supporters , taking them with the dross that are the football hooligans . #% 
Any agreement on data transfer should recognise this right . #% However , delaying their admission by one more year would serve no purpose other than to send the wrong signal to their peoples and governments . #% I would appeal to the House that in some ways it is more important to get a clear answer than to get one that suits everyone ; one that is absolutely perfect in every respect . #% The financial envelope of the proposal should be covered by additional resources . '' #% It may be that some of those arrested have been over enthusiastic in their activities and , technically , may have appeared to have broken Greek law but others in the group , including Mrs Coppin , have done absolutely nothing wrong . #% Am I correct in assuming they are the stumbling block in this affair ? #% Last week Gordon Brown admitted that the UK had failed to maximise on its twin presidencies of the EU and G8 to complete its ambitious development agenda . #% Mr President , I thank Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for his report . #% . Mr President , this report represents a wide-ranging analysis of the problems facing Romania in its development to meet the high standards we demand for joining the European Union . #% Corruption is endemic in Azerbaijan and the promise of wealth from its oil reserves is , as yet , unrealised . #% I fully supported the final compromise and , indeed , the benefits that it will deliver . #% That is not a healthy situation . #% In your statement you said you would now make sure that under no circumstances could decommissioning funds be redirected as cross-subsidies for the commercial operations of nuclear companies . #% People are being entrapped on the Internet because of their homosexuality . #% Two hundred and eighty million Arabs live without democracy . #% You fought for democracy . #% It was thought necessary because some airlines had got into a very bad habit of cancelling flights at the last minute , overbooking flights , inflicting delay because of inefficient operational practices and then , to add insult to injury , they treated their victims -- their passengers -- with total disdain and little or no sympathy . #% Would a carcass trade not be better for Europe to be considering ? #% In this context I should like to use my time to flag up one particular concern I have about the possible impact of the proposed - if I can use the horrid word - `` Amsterdamised '' versions of the Brussels and Rome Treaties relating to the operation of this part of the single market . #% I would , however , say that there is no rush . #% The company statute is a voluntary measure and no company , when this proposal is eventually adopted , will be forced to set up a company statute against its wishes . #% As a vegetarian , I have strong reservations about the whole meat production business . #% I hope that in the future we will have a better relationship when we deal with these extremely important economic and monetary questions . #% There is a major problem in drafting a coordinated policy in that there is a lack of comparable data in relation to social and health problems with alcohol consumption and abuse . #% Commissioner , it is official documents which are accessible . #% The second year 's report was made only 11 months later , and this year the report is actually in October . #% Competition and customers are powerful forces for growth and for better services . #% The whole thing was a travesty ! #% You have sacked a Director-General , but the Commissioners are still in place . #% All we want now is a certain candour in that matter in this debate . #% Firstly , neither the European Parliament nor the EU-ACP Joint Assembly was invited to participate in the summit . #% We must clearly seek new ways of providing an adequate level of social protection which will enable and encourage more men and women of working age to gain employment and earn a proper income to enable them to care for their families and undertake lifelong learning as well as holding down jobs . #% Category one , which contains specified risk material , was implicated in the spread of BSE . #% And finally , it is crucial to ensure maximum involvement of the users of this legislation , particularly businesses , because they know best how this legislation affects them . #% Firstly , by restricting the scope of the directive to biofuels , we could hinder rather than help achieve our overall environmental objectives . #% For this reason alone , it would be sensible for the ECB in future to vote by majority . #% The best guarantee of human rights is the ability of people to cooperate at an international level . #% However , coded calls for his assassination recently by Israel 's Deputy Prime Minister are not helpful , as he was recognised as the elected PA Chairman , and this lowers the moral tone of the debate . #% I am sorry the Italian presidency is not here today , but I had a chance to meet the Italian minister and his team , who played a crucial role in negotiating what was a very well-balanced declaration and action plan . #% At the moment only about half our citizens know their rights as consumers . #% Instead of Parliament electing at least the President of the Commission on a proposal of the national governments , should it not simply elect whoever it likes as President of the Commission ? #% Finally a word on the participation of the EU delegation in the Bonn conference . #% Again , Britain 's Labour Government is leading the way . #% So those of us who have come to ask a supplementary question are being denied our democratic right . #% You do that for example by the next debate on energy , by showing that we are working together in solidarity to face any threats that there may be . #% Madam President , I also wish to congratulate the rapporteurs on their reports . #% The current stories about budget cuts for the centre are not acceptable and I hope that a strong message will be sent to the Commission and the Council . #% We are convinced that today 's vote is , in the long run , good for the health and profitability of the European cosmetics industry , as well as the public it serves . #% When you say these things in the Council , how can you simultaneously do the opposite ? #% Confidence is a key factor . #% And that will be at the forefront of our discussions at the trialogue this week and in the conciliation on 20 July . #% When it comes to cost , if , again , we say we value something and we put no resources behind it , we expose our hypocrisy . #% What a glaring inconsistency . #% In addition , last June the Commission decision implementing the regulation establishing the anti-fraud office , OLAF , explicitly made the provision that officials and servants of the Commission , and I quote , `` who become aware of evidence which gives rise to the presumption of the existence of possible cases of fraud , corruption or any other illegal activities detrimental to the interest of the Communities '' are obliged to inform their hierarchy or the Secretary-General or the Director of the European anti-fraud office , OLAF . #% Let us make sure we have an agricultural policy which helps our farmers , helps the budget and helps the new democracies . #% I welcome the recent comments of the German Economics Minister , who said that we do not need industrial patriotism and said that foreign investors should be welcomed with open arms , not just tolerated . #% We note that as yet there is no evidence to link depleted uranium and ill health suffered either by troops or civilians . #% Mr President , it is worth reminding ourselves that we use the word ` terrorist ' to describe one who seeks to cause terror , and truly do those responsible for the Beslan siege define that word -- terror , horror , shock . #% In terms of the construction of Europe , the role of sport was formally recognised by the Communities in the Adonino report presented to the Milan European Council in June 1985 . #% Whether we adopt or reject the amendment for EUR 500 million , let us not forget that -- as I keep saying -- it is still the first reading . #% In the past Mexicans have suffered grievous violations of their human rights without the culprits being detected or punished . #% The issue here is one of the government and the judiciary , but of the government and the security services . #% The ACP has been asked to do a great deal and too often the institutional infrastructure and lack of capacity has raised questions as to whether these proposals will contribute to their development in a manner that they want . #% It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else . #% Mr President , this is a very important subject for the fishing industry and for the marine environment generally . #% To take the example of textiles again , we have heard already in the debate how countries such as Bangladesh , Laos , Cambodia , Sri Lanka and Nepal all depend on textile and clothing for the vast majority of their industrial exports . #% 
Instructive , however , in clarifying the need for the international community to set up a permanent international criminal tribunal which can deal with the all-too-frequent acts of genocide which besmirch us all . #% We hope that the Commission will accept that the grounds for concern are justified and that Parliament will give its support to the amendment . #% Any private entity behaving in the way that the Commission has would find itself in breach of EU laws on information and consultation , collective redundancies and transfer of undertakings . #% So does he agree that codecision is the way forward in this policy area ? #% This has not yet been officially confirmed but I believe it to be the case . #% This week , there is a rare opportunity to begin rectifying these injustices . #% Whether the Council respects our rights and our prerogatives remains to be seen . #% They will have at their disposal two interpreters in one room for 15 languages . #% If the matter changes , perhaps you might wish to come back to the question at a later date . #% It is not sensible that we should create a piece of legislation that puts Member States in this position . #% Why has some better organization not been found for today 's agenda ? #% This proves beyond doubt that the overarching ambition of the European Union is a single nation with its single national flag , its single national anthem , its single legal space , its single national borders and now the citizens of Europe will soon be able to breath single European air . #% The problem is that there is really no indication of exactly where the ECU 7 million involved is coming from . #% I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called `` a big bang approach '' . #% Secondly , we need to ensure that we have a proper civilian crisis management arrangement . #% It appeared to be presented to us on the basis that it was the other politician who was taking proceedings against Mr Bossi on the basis of words that he had spoken . #% It is not sustainable and that is why we have urged the use of appropriate environmental indicators alongside the social and economic ones . #% -- Madam President , if an honourable colleague has been unfortunately delayed and is not in the Chamber for his or her question , but then arrives three questions later -- there are , after all , very few colleagues present -- would you , in your personal capacity , please take question number 72 ? #% We have every sympathy with those victims and believe that such donations should come from national governments or charities . #% I echo the Commissioner 's words in congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Liese , who has ably steered a path , strengthening the protection of human health , ensuring informed consent and avoiding most of the pitfalls of previous debates in this area of human endeavour . #% This raises the question of why , in Iraq , the British and Americans have encouraged the adoption of a constitution which enshrines Sharia law and will severely curb the freedom of many women . #% We do not need the heavy regulatory touch of the past . #% But if we are to have this agreement we have to be willing to negotiate , we have to move . #% You will no doubt know that the system of proportional representation was used for the first time in the UK in the last European elections and the people who voted in these elections voted for a party whose views they agreed with , not for an individual . #% I need no lectures about subsidies to tobacco producers , having consistently opposed them since election to this House . #% As a compromise arrangement I think and I hope it will be very successful . #% If we discover in our review period , when the Commission does this , that cross-border re-use has either not happened or been very limited , then we might well have to revisit some of the elements in this particular proposal . #% So , thanks to the Commission ; thanks to Mr Liikanen and his team for facilitating the process ; thanks to the Luxembourg presidency which , I hope , as others have said , has set a precedent for the future in working with Parliament ; thanks to the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets for the extremely hard work they have done for Members ; and thanks to that ` devil ' of Parliament - which many people seem to think he is - Mr Samland , for the skill that he showed during the conciliation process and along with that , to the members of the Budgets Committee who were with him in getting that agreement with the Council . #% We are fiddling while Rome burns . #% I am sure that the DG on Transport and Energy has a copy of the UK 's road safety strategy that was published in March 2000 . #% It is also a market-opening measure without using sledgehammers to crack nuts . #% This directive will benefit workers exposed to risks from artificial sources of optical radiation in a wide range of working environments : everything from electric arc welders to workers using advanced industrial lasers . #% Second , in terms of emerging risks , I hope the Commission will look at the need for new laws in areas such as harassment at work , recently called for by Parliament . #% If Mr Prodi and his colleagues wish to remedy Euro-scepticism and Euro-apathy , I am calling for true democracy and for the elected representatives to have much more authority over the programme and policies of this institution . #% Firstly , South African fishing . #% So asking people what they want is a no-no . #% I do not agree with Mr Goodwill that there may be more harm than good in that . #% I refer in particular to Zimbabwe , where in the last few days police have arrested over 500 people - including Members of Parliament - and hospitals have treated more than 250 people with serious injuries . #% I have no doubt it will continue do so if these policies persist . #% Mr President , to follow on from what my two colleagues have just said , I took part in the adoption of this directive with Mrs Corbey and others . #% In reconsidering that option we need to do more , as Mr Virrankoski said , on co-financing on agriculture . #% However , the continuing application of Hong Kong 's legal system has been promised in every detail and therefore we must demand that the law is applied consistently , in accordance with the Basic Law . #% I calculate that three-quarters of all the amendments to the text that we will vote on on Thursday originated from our group . #% Madam President , I request your help . #% What about Israel ? #% We also share the view that the procedure for dealing with these policy strategies as they go through the committees and then through the budget process will be very important in order for us to be able to see that they are properly brought together . #% In addition , we are spending a lot of money on our external policies , particularly through the PHARE and TACIS programmes , on ways of developing the important role of the environment and the sustainable development of those areas so close to our own borders . #% His radio station Moscow Echo was selected by President Clinton a few days ago for the only substantive interview that he gave to a Russian outlet . #% They would be in a peculiar position because they would find that non-Member States were involved in a free movement arrangement which as Member States they were not part of . #% One of the good things about Mr Maat 's report is that he has differentiated between animals going for slaughter and those going for further fattening . #% In her report , Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking , yet desperately needed . #% I hope too that she will offer support for the Community initiatives and the innovative projects which , as the report points out , represent 70 % of the total underspends . #% Finally , we are very concerned that feed coming in from outside the European Union also meets these very strict criteria . #% I want to repeat some of the concerns I have expressed elsewhere . #% They also raise side issues which could affect Kashmir . #% The convergence criteria have helped , of course , and we have managed to maintain some investment as a result of consolidated budgetary and fiscal policies . #% If the Commissioners have not had sight of these articles I would be happy to let them have them . #% I welcome this proposal from Mr Rothley on behalf of our group , and particularly thank him because he has accepted a number of suggestions that I have made to him in this area and added them to his report . #% I am certainly encouraged by the commitment , not only that shown today but throughout , on these issues . #% I believe you have a whole host of problems coming forward and , should you read the political tea-leaves correctly , you will be keen to get your reforms under way even quicker than you have done . #% It is fair to say there has never been a dull moment . #% That is unacceptable because the failure of the nuclear industry to make proper provision for the cost of decommissioning distorts competition . #% Together with the forthcoming programme on rare diseases , plus what I hope will prove an effective new framework for public health policy over the next five years , this initiative offers realistic new hope to those who suffer pain and misery . #% We need to review the delicate balance of civil rights , -- and I agree with that -- but it is very important that those who go about their normal lives -- their normal , innocent and lawful lives -- should be protected . #% I thank the Commissioner for his detailed response . #% No strategy for economic growth is complete without addressing the growing crisis of climate change . #% 
We had evidence from Mr Bildt , Mr Kouchner , Mr Hombach and then from all the other agencies , that this is a long-term problem we have in front of us . #% I am concerned with a number of aspects of the reports we have discussed this morning , especially regarding the intrusion on Member States ' subsidiarity in terms of educational targets and social policy . #% I would just take issue with him on one point . #% You will have to answer for the impact this will have on local jobs and local manufacturers . #% This demonstrates that when the European Union sets itself clear targets and when it sets itself realistic timetables , we can achieve great things in this Europe . #% It is an example of a vital link to a group of islands , of which , of course , there are many others throughout the Community . #% Mr President , I was in Ethiopia and Eritrea just a few weeks ago , and I met both the Prime Minister of Ethiopia and the President of Eritrea , along with many other politicians and people . #% This is not the opportunity to slay a few fatted calves and have a feast . #% We have to encourage the in-patent sector to develop new medicines but the generic sector also provides affordable medicines . #% The first is to have a real debate about priorities of the Union . #% My gut feeling is that there will be no agreement with the Council on getting a revision of the financial perspective . #% It adds over GBP 2 billion to the British economy every year and the local economy enjoys another GBP 200 million from the cruise industry alone . #% Clearly , where there is competition around , price becomes important . #% They have to know the upside as well as the downside . #% Mr President , we have never done anything like this before and I welcome the opportunity to open this debate . #% Our real objective here is for the persons concerned to be afforded the necessary support , if required , in terms of sustenance and medical assistance , when transiting through airports on their way to their destination . #% In short , this e-commerce initiative makes A grade business sense . #% We also have to recognise that the Environment Agency set up in Copenhagen has a role in identifying problems and informing the Commission so that it can take rapid action . #% Why should absolute priority be given to fulfilling the capabilities requirement of the EDSP ? #% It is clear that no long-term peace in the Middle East is possible until we see an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine . #% To conclude , tourism and tourists will be the shock-troops of the euro , bringing the benefits of the euro immediately to the attention of all Europe 's citizens . #% We must make this a reality . #% I was hoping that this report would lay down a marker to say that the authorities ought to be able to use information given by national information centres to other Member States . #% I would like to thank her for the way she has done it and the way she has so freely shared her knowledge with us . #% Will the Commissioner stand up to the Monetary Committee ? #% The Commission action on mobile roaming charges is excellent , by the way . #% I have listened carefully to what the rapporteur had to say . #% I have criticised the bullying of peaceful Taiwan in excluding this country from all international organisations , including the World Health Organisation . #% Secondly , although I am delighted with what we have been told and although we have made a lot of progress in eliminating the noisier aircraft , all aircraft are noisy to some extent , especially at certain times of the day . #% But there is always room for interpreting Treaties and for going for one interpretation rather than another . #% That represented a fundamental failure in the early discussions between the Commission and Parliament . #% It is a project that the Commissioner has tried to distance himself from entirely and a process that is democratically deficient , owing to a failure to consider , consult or compromise with those at its heart . #% Will the Commission 's own systems actually function properly ? #% These are not all the same things . #% Yet one warning : the schemes must be part of the solution , not the problem . #% That obligation also means defending an acquitted person against any questioning of their innocence of the charges on which they were acquitted . #% But it is clear that if we are to tackle the problem , we need , as Mr Gargani has said - and I think my group would also underline - to move towards a binding European certificate of inheritance . #% Mr President , two months ago we adopted an urgent resolution in this House regarding Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and he still has not been released from detention . #% That is no way to promote the Lisbon Agenda . #% There were UN resolutions that called for a plebiscite for the people of Kashmir all that time ago , and still nothing has happened . #% That is something we could also look at investing in , in a more serious way than we do currently . #% Eight and a half years it has taken you to get this treaty through , and on 1 December you will have it . #% Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries , I would like to compliment Mr Koukiadis on his report and thank him for the consideration he has given to the conclusions of the Committee on Fisheries , for whom issues of safety are a high priority . #% Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , you have rightly placed emphasis on meeting the expectations of our peoples . #% We need to know that is being done and we need to hear from you that it is being done . #% She has never been elected to anything and no one knows who she is ! #% They want this legislation quickly and they want it now . #% Secondly , the public has lost confidence in the old national and European food safety systems ; after the scandals and scares about olive oil , wine , mineral water , beef , eggs , poultry , milk , e-coli , listeria , salmonella , dioxins , hormones and GM foods - and the list goes on . #% Please take a look at the statistics in your own countries . #% It is for this reason that this dialogue is so important . #% Protectionism by the European Union against the developing world is morally unacceptable and economically short-sighted . #% They had never heard of the company on the side of the lorry and the driver paid cash for the ferry . #% It really is time to stop the illusion that suggests that European Union competitiveness can somehow be invented at annual spring European Union summits . #% We are all very aware that one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency , quite rightly , is to tackle the scandalous position regarding road safety in the European Union . #% As the Commissioner said , this is a key part of the Lisbon Agenda , which we support . #% Many colleagues have mentioned the low turnout at the last European elections - 49 % overall , 24 % in my country . #% But we are now reaching a point where we can thoroughly support , by a large majority , the outcome of the rapporteur 's work . #% It also appears that the exemptions discriminate against smaller countries which lack the manufacturing base to produce the required life-saving drugs under compulsory licences . #% I hope also , in spite of the great Anglo-American solidarity over Iraq , that the United States will no longer merely take on trust Mr Blair 's promotion of ESDP . #% Paragraph 4 goes on to say that the Parliament ` considers the Member States ' approach to be a breach of the principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions ' and that it ` interprets this approach as a signal that the Council intends to abandon the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Perspective included therein ' . #% The Colom i Naval report seems to have caused a lot of problems recently but hopefully we will have a solution in the very near future and those in the Member States who have been ringing around and those in the Commission who have been - dare I say - panicking can put their minds at rest . #% It has been suggested , for example , that a single strategic platform should be created at a level to bring together all key actors to work together on growth , innovation and jobs in each sector and to coordinate existing instruments such as technology platforms , skills expert panels and joint technology initiatives . #% We have an opportunity to make a contribution to the process of reducing pollution and cleaning the air we breathe . #% Fourthly , this proposal expressly excludes the mandatory application of international accounting standards as far as SMEs are concerned . #% We have to make sure that the access-providers as well as service and content providers recognize their responsibilities in this matter , firstly , for the identification of each service and secondly for the classification without which filtering will not be possible . #% In this Green Paper the Commission looked at several issues , a number of which are intended to deepen the analysis of obstacles to free movement and are outside the scope of this present proposal . #% 
However , I would not like to see the new date being used as an excuse for having a long , drawn-out IGC from autumn 2003 to May 2004 . #% I support the drift of the question from Mr Paisley that all minority languages should be given equality of esteem . #% This of course has had a devastating effect on cattle farmers , cattle farmers throughout Europe , and the clean beef prices have been dramatically affected in the market place . #% We agreed about many things , particularly the need to move such issues sharply up the agenda . #% Mr President , on a point of order , it was a big disappointment that President Prodi did not present his reform package on regulation to a Conference of Presidents open to all Members . #% The one thing they have to learn is that you can not defy the laws of mathematics . #% I think that it is perhaps time that the Commission supported those countries in having their own independent voice in NAFO . #% Mr President , I am very sorry to have heard in the debate MEPs from my own region in the UK from different parties say that they will be opposing this report . #% We have no idea now what our external policies will be , particularly in relation to enlargement . #% The United Kingdom , on the other hand , which has a higher level of BSE incidence at the moment , removes all animals over 30 months from the food chain , as well as adopting a whole raft of other measures . #% There are other weapon systems that could be used instead of antipersonnel landmines to equal effect , but without the negative dangers . #% The intention to repeal or to amend the Bill of Rights Ordinance - which includes provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - along with the Societies Ordinance - which was aimed after all at dealing with the Triads - as well as the Public Order Ordinance which deals with meetings and demonstrations must cause us some concern about the future of human rights in Hong Kong . #% She inspired me with an interest in this area of law and as she gradually retired and handed over her practice , I became more and more familiar with the workings of the Brussels Convention as it came into force in the UK . #% A majority accept the Commission proposals but want products with more than 0.5 % of GMOs or less if practicable , to be labelled as such . #% We say again , today , that oil sanctions remain the only instrument available to the international community which will guarantee change ; oil earnings , which account for 96 % of all Nigeria 's export earnings , with 40 % of all federal government revenue provided by one European company : Shell . #% Mr President , on a point of information , Mrs Gradin stated that the Commission called in the police on the matter of DG XXIII . #% The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia . #% It is a fact that 36 % of Burundi 's budget is currently being spent on defence ; far more than they spend on health and education combined . #% With the experience of the Iraq crisis behind him , I sincerely hope that the British Prime Minister will realise the folly and indeed mischief of creating defence institutions which will merely exacerbate divisions between European countries and the United States . #% It puts on a clear and transparent footing the method by which the Union will finance trans-national European political parties . #% I would , however , say as an aside that I regret that in staffing issues we do not make more use of fixed term contracts . #% We welcome the position that you have taken on this particular issue . #% We must be tough and take the necessary action to protect our interests in this steel dispute , but also think of the broader context and form a vision of how the transatlantic partnership should look in the 21st century . #% We have turned a blind eye to what has gone on in Albania for too long and we are now reaping the consequences . #% Mr von Wogau was the rapporteur and will remember that we obtained a three-month deadline for measures that fall within that category . #% This example should serve as a paradigm for the EU 's future actions within our emerging Common Foreign and Security Policy . #% I would like to ask the President of the European Monetary Institute to respond to the points that I am going to make . #% Thirdly , as both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council have mentioned , this summer we all signed an interinstitutional agreement explicitly designed to ensure better law-making in the European Union . #% I know what we voted , but I also know what has been said . #% When we determine an industrial policy - which we should do for the pharmaceutical sector - we have to recognize that it is a much broader sector than the other industries we have looked at in the past . #% Equally , there is rationale behind trying to approximate the fines across the different States to ensure that we have a combined front against these traffickers . #% Can I have your reassurance that the fulfilment of the Lisbon agenda will indeed colour your entire presidency , as I am confident it will ? #% We are running a EUR 6 billion deficit with the United States . #% These promises must be realised . #% In particular , we observed huge improvements in human rights , including minority rights , such as for the Roma communities and the gay community . #% My constituents do not doubt the authority or the legitimacy of this democratically elected Parliament , but they do not wish to be governed by it . #% I fully support this report which recognises the diverse advantages that sport has to offer , from improving social skills and integration to working with and including voluntary organisations . #% It is very difficult for South Africa , France , Britain or other nations to control fisheries within their own EEZs . #% Mr President , I welcome the Prime Minister 's historic speech . #% This means that Amendment No 42 , the committee 's bridging , and , to some extent , warning amendment , can be replaced by Amendment No 55 . #% The answer is no-one . #% It is absolutely vital that we are involved . #% Would that not help ? #% Mr President , the proportion of freight transported by rail within the EU has almost halved over the last thirty years . #% As someone with a deep interest in the former Soviet republics in Central Asia , I see parallels between that region and Belarus . #% There was a request from our Group for a split vote on the last few words . #% I am appalled that the ECR Group , which contains the British Conservatives , has submitted an amendment to this proposal which reduces its coverage . #% My feelings are clear : if the Council wishes to reserve powers to itself when the information from Eurodac should be available to this democratic body , Parliament , then that is unacceptable . #% The Commission has closely followed developments in Sri Lanka and is greatly concerned by the grave setback inflicted on the peace process by recent events , including the deployment of troops in the capital and the decision to bring the cabinet portfolios of defence , interior , and communications under the remit of the President . #% In any case , if we do get agreement on reduced rates of fuel duty for biofuels , that would make mandatory targets less necessary . #% A good company will look after its workforce . #% I wear my third hat as a British Labour Member who is at odds with a number of amendments from his own political family , the PSE . #% We would like to encourage independent regulators to work together to provide simple , impartial price comparisons for consumers and use the sort of new tools they have available , like the Internet , to give consumers the ability to calculate the real cost of their calls . #% That is why in my response today I have been unable to accommodate , any more than I could at the committee stage , some of those on either the Left or the Right who wish to make this also a debate about eco-labelling , the virtues of organic produce or , on the other side , the virtues and provability of GM technology . #% So the city of Henry the Navigator may become the city of Netscape the navigator , a new approach which I thoroughly welcome . #% Effectively , this means border management , hand-in-hand with common policies on asylum and immigration . #% However , it also contains many proposals to which we are firmly opposed . #% Institutional theology is not the priority of the citizens of Europe . #% The reality is that we live in a dangerous world in which our liberty is threatened by terrorists , dictators and violent crimes . #% Finally , could we start the session on a Thursday at 2 p.m. instead of 3 p.m. and have the votes on urgencies at 4.30 p.m. . #% Mr President , I wish to make a short statement . #% This directive to control the emission of VOCs from industrial installations has the support of my group , and I would like to give my personal thanks to the rapporteur for the hard work that he has undertaken and what he has achieved so far . #% The report highlights the fundamentally inadequate procedures for combating fraud and more importantly how slow the Commission was to react to clear evidence of major problems within Eurostat . #% The acquisition of an international legal personality would be a powerful instrument for the Union . #% I am the first to confess that I do not think this is a very glorious suggestion but it is a pragmatic one . #% I was curious though that there was no reference - unless I missed it - to the Council Presidency comments of a month or so ago , because I thought those remarks were also very helpful to the debate and they made the point very clearly that , whilst the Barcelona objectives had not yet been reached - in some cases , by a very long way - it was very clear that a number of countries did not have any immediate plans to reach them and did not see that as a particular problem . #% 
Madam President , I do not normally give explanations of vote but on this occasion I shall , because this may have been one of the last actions in this present Parliament , and I want to avoid any possible misunderstanding about what is perhaps an ambiguous vote . #% Sadly , in the last two years , huge numbers of Iraqis - perhaps over two million - have left , particularly the long-suffering , persecuted Christian Assyrian minorities who have been squeezed on all sides by Islamists , who accuse them of collaborating with the crusaders , and by the Kurds , who want their lands . #% That costs our health systems EUR 102 million per year and is the major cause of absenteeism from work . #% However , we all share values of freedom , fairness and equality for every person and every Member State . #% The Commission proposals , as I understand them , threaten the UK growers and would leave UK processors with no domestic supply of raw material . #% Keep the word safety in the title of the authority to give a clear signal as to its purpose and methodology . #% The questions enable me to report publicly and fully to this House on an issue that I know has aroused interest particularly in Sweden . #% But we also need to stress to the US that we need fair trade . #% The tragedy is , certainly in one area , that we find that the structural funds are underspent in 1995 by ECU 4.4 billion . #% Even natural products like the leather of these desks or wood are treated with chemicals ; and of course we put chemicals in our bodies , both as food additives and as residues from pesticides ; and we use cosmetics , some of us more than others , which come into intimate contact with our bodies . #% It is pretty hard to get an agreement when the Council just ignores Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement . #% Or , in some cases , there is a completely different sort of financial offset in terms of an agreement to buy products from a company in another market . #% Madam President , I voted for the report with some reluctance because I feel there should be more urgency for reform than is actually contained within it . #% While funding programmes are beneficial , they are also short-term in nature . #% Let me say immediately that religious persecution is non-Islamic . #% The public does not support you . #% In his first term he supported witch hunts against journalists such as Hans-Martin Tillack who exposed frauds . #% That is why our joint resolution insists on the importance of a strategic partnership , one which stresses coordination and cooperation in meeting global challenges and regional issues and in which legislators are full and serious players . #% We have the absurdity of John Major 's deal in 1992 during the then British Presidency that gave Germany the recognition of Croatia and the consequent tens of thousands of deaths in the ensuing civil wars . #% It may well be that by focusing on that , management could have avoided some of its worst mistakes . #% Last , but not least , as noted by the rapporteur himself , the creation of a uniform , simplified control document , a Community coach licence , will avoid the present confusing situation whereby old documents are amended by hand . #% But it wholly ignores the bigger intercultural dialogue between the different European cultures and those of the wider world , for instance that of the Indian subcontinent . #% I hope it works and that we have a mid-term review . #% I will tell you where they were made : in Europe . #% However , whilst I may welcome them as a British Labour Member , I am here not as a British Labour Member but as a rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets , and can not support them . #% This is a trend we desperately need to reverse . #% It is now an accepted part of our procedure and one which is welcomed by all democrats . #% Will you pay particular attention to the nature and level of any proposed royalty payment which is being put forward which , if adopted , must be kept to a minimum rate with minimum bureaucracy ? #% If this company in the vanguard of European industry pays so little attention to its most important asset , its workforce , it can only be time for the Commission to strengthen and reinforce legislation that is clearly not strong enough . #% I recommend this report and the draft directive to the House as an important plank in opening up the single market to electronic commerce . #% I have to say that I think it is crazy for this House to consider removing the possibility of national symbols on the new currency when it is issued . #% A majority of African countries are overwhelmingly dependent on just one or two commodities for the bulk of their foreign exchange earnings . #% According to the findings of the Asian Development Bank , quoted by the UN 's own rapporteur in his report , the country spends only 0.17 percent of its GDP on health care and a comparable amount on education . #% While Thames Estuary Plastics have had to wait nearly two years for confirmation of their support , another company , Camtac of South Woodham Ferrers , have waited so long that their success in the meantime means they now no longer have need for the loan . #% We have heard the Council and the Commission being urged to act . #% I always think that any laws which are passed and are retrospective also open up all sorts of problems . #% I understand Britair is going to court over subsidies to the new competitor Ryanair , which appear to breach state aid rules . #% This week I had a visitors ' group from the Winchester Probus Club , mainly retired people and , in general terms , well informed about world affairs . #% The EPLP believes therefore the emphasis should not be on harmonization but in sharing best practice on enforcement in road safety . #% It seems from the events of 11 September in New York that democracies are particularly vulnerable to terrorism , which has no respect for the ballot box as a way to achieve change in societies . #% Mr President , as a friend of the large Cypriot community which I represent in London , I have always supported peaceful reunification of Cyprus . #% As recent events have shown only too clearly , the American regulatory system is not always a good one . #% I would ask you what you think we could do together to promote this type of action . #% The European founding fathers , whilst rightly revered in this House and whose achievements are undoubtedly as great if not greater than Kennedy 's , are less well known . #% Turning to transport , we want to see action quickly here too . #% I welcome President Santer 's discussion of the role of cities , towns and regions in the economic reconstruction of Europe . #% What is at stake here ? #% Secondly , we have some disagreement with the line taken by Mr Kittelmann . #% Our first priority now is to help bring an end to the senseless violence in Libya . #% Vaccination is not as simple as some suggest . #% We also want progress on both the working time directive and the slot allocation at airport directive , as well as measures to end the misery in air traffic control delays in Europe at this moment . #% We are dedicated to ensuring maximum strength and maximum dependability in these vital procedures . #% The regulation shows , in fact , that the Commission recognizes that there is a necessity for better coordination between available instruments and that the elaboration of a more holistic approach to development is also very welcome . #% Baroness Ashton , as Vice-President/High Representative , you have recently come under pressure for its lacklustre performance . #% The EU should seek positively to raise standards of protection of citizens ' rights and a culture of respect for fundamental freedoms in order to create the mutual trust necessary for mutual recognition . #% Between 1985 and 1989 57 , 000 cattle from the United Kingdom were exported to countries in the European Union . #% Parliament 's resolution of May 2002 made a proposal which still has not been taken up . #% For years the European Union in general , and the European Commission in particular , have been strongly criticised for shortcomings in financial procedures by Member States . #% Secondly , will the Commission ensure that when changes to GATT are being negotiated , the health and welfare of European citizens and their farm animals can be properly protected and not susceptible to the kind of commercial pressure which seems to be being exerted under GATT by the United States ? #% We know well the dilemma in dealing with a report that has to straddle the interests of business and consumers . #% Mr President , I should just like to observe that the leaks do not help the Commission 's cause to be involved in foreign and security policy decisions . #% Two million people are homeless , and they are still being terrorised by the Janjaweed militias . #% We do not label very low levels of residues of pesticides or chemical contaminates in foodstuffs although we know they are present . #% That is why , as a group , we have submitted a number of amendments to Mr Sterckx 's report . #% So if the conference is to be held there , we need to question the Thai Government about this problem . #% We need to value it , improve it , and build on it as a model for North-South cooperation . #% 
Defence procurement and defence budgets are essentially matters of national concern and should not become a Community responsibility . #% In short , it is back to the failed policies of the 1970s . #% Biomass is a most important form of energy , accounting for 65 % of the renewable energy used in the EU . #% All of those are possible if we adopt these two reports . #% However , this will all be swept aside and lost if the EU embarks on the madness of a Constitution . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , we are not asking to reopen the vote , we are asking to vote on the text that we have in front of us . #% The report also calls for the environmental objectives to be taken into account in the enlargement process . #% As the drafter of the opinion from the Petitions Committee on this proposal , we made the point that many petitions arise from the failure to consult adequately at the strategic stage . #% The question is , do the Commission and Council accept their political priorities ? #% In that context , I am delighted to welcome the Commission 's communication on this matter . #% Third , it must be transparent . #% We want a workable and effective proposal for all the citizens of Europe . #% The first one , which we on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs support , would be the creation of a satellite agency . #% We will be proposing a very slight amendment suggesting that the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee should be allowed to sit as observers on the proposed institutional group . #% The apparent slippage in the Government 's position , which has been confirmed this morning by the Prime Minister , is of concern to us and we obviously watch carefully to ensure that British taxpayers do not become pawns in discussions over the future of our budget . #% Let us have a look in a bit more detail at what they really mean . #% We therefore suggested that we should have some overall view of this and , for that purpose , on first reading , we put 500 staff into the reserve - the additional posts requested . #% I congratulate him on his excellent report . #% Incidentally , we still allow them to be used in spermicides in condom production where there is no alternative . #% Mr President , most of my constituents were probably not aware that an important meeting of EU Governments took place in Tampere last week on justice and home affairs . #% We must move forward in other areas as well . #% in writing . - The EPLP believes that the Lisbon Strategy remains an important platform for growth and job creation across the EU . #% I anticipate us supporting all the amendments which have been tabled . #% What is different ? #% This might possibly be regulation , but there is no reason at that stage why some form of self - or co-regulation should not be considered as a proper option . #% When the deputy Health minister visited the European Commission recently , it was the - male - deputy Health minister , Dr Feroz , who attended , not the Health minister herself , the only senior minister who is a woman . #% The devastation caused by HIV/AIDS is well-known but TB is increasing and malaria remains endemic . #% Madam President , I would like to raise briefly a matter of serious concern to me , and perhaps to others in this House , relating to the question of discrimination . #% If one good thing has come out of the 1996 report , it has been the access which the Committee on Budgetary Control has had to persons and papers . #% The EUR 605 million is what the negotiations are all about , so I am not yet in a position to be able to say to him whether that overall price is satisfactory to us , whether it meets the needs we have or what our eventual position following the conclusion of negotiations will be about that price . #% Let us have an honest debate about it rather than hide within the Trojan Horse of supposed healthcare issues . #% Firstly , we all agree about stressing the dangers of nuclear proliferation . #% If there are documents and impact assessments , they should be clearly attached to that . #% We see no sign of change . #% My vote is to endorse that clear overall finding and not the associated detail , which , inevitably in the absence of clear cooperation by the authorities , is speculation , which , while often right , is from time to time wrong . #% I must however say that , as a Liberal who treasures the diversity and pluralism of public opinion , I have some personal doubts about the wisdom of advocating two opposing blocks in the European debate either here or , more generally , in the Member States . #% It is a positive step towards eliminating difficulties with translation and communication between drivers and various authorities and it will take the ` aggro ' out of many incidents . #% We know it is not , and I think you know it is not , Commissioner . #% Sadly it expires in 2002 and we must incorporate it into the Community budget . #% We are seeing again in certain countries a decline in voluntary work , for example , with all the repercussions that has for wider society . #% Its fledgling role as banking committee for the citizens of Europe must be developed and essentially the ECB governor should present not only the bank 's annual report but also offer regular , possibly quarterly , explanations of its interest rate decisions , and the minutes themselves should be published in summary form showing the decisions made plus explanatory commentary . #% The House will be aware that it is not unusual and not irregular for Member States to raise these types of issues from time to time . #% Therefore , I have absolutely no problem in recommending to colleagues that this House should give its assent to the accession of the Community to The Hague Conference . #% Lastly , on external policy , our rapporteur has indicated the need to set priorities . #% Naturally-produced foods untainted by excessive use of pesticides etc. , food with real favour and nutritional value are increasingly what European consumers are quite rightly demanding . #% As someone who wants to see real reform of the CAP I find it to be an unbearable burden and something I just can not agree with . #% What has been produced by the Commission is a major contribution to dealing with the saturation of airspace . #% However , we must not rest on our laurels but ensure that tourism remains dynamic and that this growth does not stagnate . #% This is the task which will put the European Parliament on the political map forever . #% British Conservatives have always been and remain strong supporters of EU enlargement as it provides a larger single market and a looser and more flexible Europe of nation states . #% I reported to this House previously that Mr van Buitenen , a short time after ending his period of suspension , was informed that he had a right to seek employment in any of the European Union institutions in a job for which he was qualified . #% Mr President , I would like to add my congratulations and thanks to the Ombudsman for the report which he has presented this year and also to Mrs Thors and Mrs Lambert for their reports to the Parliament . #% In fact , I think it is my job to ensure that performing artists and organisations that facilitate performing arts are as free as possible from well-meaning , but misplaced and naïve , initiatives like this one . #% We will listen to the debate because our overwhelming desire is to get the bones of this proposal through . #% I notice , however , that you explicitly reserve the right to bring forward better proposals . #% This has put life-saving programmes at risk and any delay now would exacerbate the existing impression in South Africa of a European Union which seeks only to serve its own interests first . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by paying tribute to Commissioner Vitorino . #% I will say more on that , but touch on the other two issues as well . #% What we see tonight - and that is all I want to take my two minutes to say - is the contempt with which the Council holds the views of this House . #% I would like to take up the subject just touched upon by the previous speaker , namely the transatlantic aspects of telecoms liberalisation and particularly paragraph 6 and 7 of the draft resolution , which refers to the unfortunate initiative by Senator Hollings to restrict the transfer of licences to telecoms companies which are more than 25 % state-owned . #% However , taken together , their collective aim is to advance and promote the political and foreign policy agenda of the European Commission . #% I want to express Parliament ' s concern that the Kyoto Protocol may falter and fail , leaving the world without any coherent network of obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . #% Are not many of these issues really political in nature rather than fundamental legal rights ? #% I wonder whether those who have been making repeated remarks in successive votes in successive plenary part-sessions on this issue do not have a political motive behind them . #% What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators , stockbrokers and option traders . #% This is a really important issue which goes to the whole heart of why we have the European Union . #% 
But it is also one of principle , not just of theoretical principle but of one that has been tested in the European Court of Human Rights , as my question points out . #% When in future the committee gets reports of maladministration relating to the outcome of individual complaints we will discuss them with interest . #% Therefore I would advise the committee to watch very carefully what the Commission is saying about nickel and Nordic gold , because we are not being told the truth . #% You have acted correctly according to the Rules of the House . #% Could I perhaps also ask Mr Bolkestein whether he is aware of the failure of Independent Insurance in the United Kingdom over recent months and the appointment by the British Government of an inquiry into the Equitable Life insurance company ? #% Many of the interpreters , I am sure , would have liked to have studied on a Erasmus course when they were learning their languages and studying at university . #% In conclusion , the 2007 budget procedure , as the first budget of the new financial perspective , represents a real opportunity for a broad mobilisation to adjust to the new policy challenges of a fast-changing world . #% In the first reading on sulphur levels in marine fuel , the European Parliament asked for stricter levels for sulphur in marine fuel , and as a first step towards looking at this , I am very pleased that the Commission has requested a study which has now been produced - that looks into the particular issues involved , arising from a potential price premium for 0.5 % sulphur in marine fuel . #% The key issue is how we allocate resources . #% Rather it is for us and indeed for governments to see what we can do to help , as far as is possible , avoid the problem in the first place . #% Experience shows that consumers ' lack of confidence in cross-border transactions can be explained by the divergences between bodies of law and by consumers ' lack of awareness of the legal guarantees available to them . #% Does the Commission support the Council ? #% When you read the European Environment Agency reports that glaciers in Switzerland retreated by 10 % in one year alone , in 2003 , you think that maybe he has a point , that we are just not realising what is happening . #% Finally , let me say that we in Parliament are not daunted or diverted by the idea that the European Parliament should only be concerned with the adoption of legislation and not with its follow-up . #% I broadly support the common position although I share some of the concerns of my colleagues in relation to animal welfare and ethical control . #% The Court of Auditors has yet again adversely commented on the weaknesses of controls , on numerous irregularities and the slow rate of recovery of monies due to the European Union . #% Also , it is absolutely critical that we have new long-term substantial funding for the Sugar Protocol countries . #% The Committee of the Regions will have to answer some serious questions . #% The history of that island has been distorted these past 30 or so years . #% As such , we in this Group also support strongly the call for a Europe-wide study to be undertaken , clearly in cooperation with the WHO , because we want to spread the knowledge and gather the knowledge as widely as possible . #% Can I congratulate Mrs Boumediene-Thiery on her report on special measures concerning the movement and residence of citizens of the Union which are justified on grounds of public policy , public security , or public health . #% Under this compromise text , the Council is obliged to repeal or amend the Solana Decision of August 2000 so that it conforms to the principles of this Regulation . #% Unemployment is 2 % . #% I was sorry that we did not uphold all of Mr Cappato 's report last time . #% Engineering is important in my constituency so I particularly appreciate the importance of patents and inventions . #% Why not send back the funding that has not been used to the countries who pay the contributions ? #% Nevertheless , I appreciate how much hard work has gone into these legislative and other texts . #% I would ask the Commissioner , therefore , to make it clear that technical reasons - that is , mechanical breakdowns - which affect operational safety , qualify as extraordinary circumstances where they affect what I have termed ` social carriers ' : shuttle services to islands and peripheral regions . #% We have no such action or statement from the European Union . #% We are faced with a double problem in this area : one , as the Commissioner mentioned , is the exponential rise in cases in Eastern Europe , and the second is the fearsome rise we are now seeing , here and across the Atlantic , in a number of newly-diagnosed cases which are multi-drug resistant . #% Things move on . #% Where is that money going to come from ? #% If we are to maintain the ceilings as they are , the only ways we can pay for increased responsibilities are either through the increasing use of flexibility instruments - and we have reservations about that - or quite simply through cuts in other lines . #% This budget line is the work of the European Parliament . #% We must get humanitarian aid , we must get peace restored , we must ensure there are proper elections based on free media and respect for the rule of law . #% Mr President , it is quite opportune that I am the last speaker , as I want to add a note of optimism to the debate , which until now has been rather gloomy . #% The original proposal called for labelling as steer , heifer or young bull , which would be sexual discrimination . #% When we look at the huge variation between Members States of what they view as safe we can see the problems raised by this concept , especially taking new forms of persecution into account . #% Upon examination , what the honourable Member will see is not any meanness or narrowness in the attitude taken to the MEDA programme . #% Our job in the new few months , as a Parliament , will be to report on the Commission 's opinions in a way that reminds all Member States that their national interest must not override our global and humanitarian obligations . #% They see it as creating a Europe that is inward-looking , that is bureaucratic , that is restrictive , whereas we should be creating a Community that is innovative and outward-looking , that reaches out to the rest of the world , that is flexible and democratic . #% Finally , the UK Government must not give export credit funding to the Ilisu dam , which threatens to be a human rights disaster for the Kurds as well as an ecological disaster . #% The matter has been under consideration for two years - too long , say some commentators , when measured against the lives of people with cancer , Parkinson 's disease or organ failure who might be aided by this research . #% The hard work of the rapporteur has meant that the potentially unnecessary bureaucracy has been addressed . #% Secondly , we hope that the deletion of Article 12 , led by the Liberals in committee , which could deprive citizens and consumers of network benefits and deprive disabled people of access , can be reinserted into the text . #% I am pleased to see that we have one representative on the Council benches . #% New technologies are inevitable , and inevitably they will affect the nature of the press and conditions for journalists . #% They have done an excellent job and have covered all the aspects which will be discussed in Dublin . #% We are now , Mr Lamy , at a critical stage in the negotiations for a successor agreement to Lomé IV and we will soon be embarking on complex discussions on trade relations with 71 ACP countries . #% I am sorry that colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development were unwilling to face these realities and that a majority on the right voted to delete essential paragraphs from Mr Rehder 's report . #% I propose that a blue metal plaque be placed on the wall at Hampton Court saying : ` On this spot on 27 October 2005 nothing happened ' or , as they say in Yorkshire : ` Eee , you must be jokin '' . #% A third of our working-age population is economically inactive . #% My only criticism is that an attempt has been made to hijack the report on behalf of the Taiwan lobby . #% Mr President , concerning the list of petitions appended to the Minutes , I wish to comment on Petiton No 727/95 by Mr James Fielding and others which concerns the position of 10 , 000 elderly people in the UK who have lost money and risk losing their homes under failed home-income plans . #% It is vitally important , when we look at emissions , to see where they take place . #% Madam President , I heard you give some names out of people who are going to make explanations of vote , but they are not here . #% Mr President , I wish to begin with a point of order . #% UK-based organisations which support terrorism in Britain or abroad must be closed down . #% In the light of this latest evidence , will you agree to review once again this damaging directive before it does more damage to employment prospects throughout the European Union ? #% Let me come to the substance . #% After all , the Internet was a tool intended to facilitate research networking . #% Therefore I support this decision by the Council of Europe . #% There is no threat to human health . #% Tell the Americans that if they want to talk in an atmosphere of confidence and trust and goodwill , the first thing they can do is to suspend their Article 84 complaint in ICAO . #% It is also important in reconnecting Europe with its people that we look at our global role . #% As far as cars without VAT are concerned , expatriate workers working for all the European institutions have the right , granted to them by the Belgian Government , to purchase certain goods , including cars , free of value-added tax in the first twelve months after they are engaged and at no time after that . #% 
Presumably , Commissioner , you would be very supportive of the notion that common rules should be observed and respected by all Members , whether or not their form and understanding of democracy and respect for international commercial law happened to coincide identically with our own . #% Mr President , a year ago Labour MEPs warmly welcomed the opening of accession talks . #% In the interests of the people of Europe and their environment , we will pursue this issue and we will not let go . #% When we pointed this out to the Commission , they said next time around they would consider involving Parliamentarians . #% Mr Lannoye says that he has gone back to retable some of the original amendments . #% Since we represent the public - the people of Europe - I hope that the Council notes that there is a wish for transparency in the Council . #% Similarly , as we have heard , the Commission 's organization of its work on human rights also shows a lack of coherence and coordination . #% The Chinese Government seems to have no inhibitions about bolstering tyrannical regimes and supplying them with weapons of oppression in exchange for access to natural resources . #% I therefore welcome the proposals extending the testing on biodegradability , making biodegradability regulations stricter generally and requiring clearer labelling and information . #% In the initial trial in November 2001 , 25 were sentenced to jail terms , but the government has decided on a second retrial of its so-called perverts . #% Experts in the fields of taxation or budgeting should substitute for regular members from time to time if that leads to better and more informed debate . #% I want an international agreement in place as soon as possible but I have concerns about the nature of such an agreement . #% We are grateful for the Commissioner 's commitment , both personally and representing the Commission . #% Lord Ashdown will have an important role in ensuring that the ALTHEA EUFOR mission does not practice arbitrary arrests or ill-treatment of detainees . #% Unfortunately , as others have said , Europe 's response is often perceived as being guided too much by our own commercial advantage , rather than the need to respond to the misery of the people in those countries where we risk undermining the very credibility of any claim that Europe is , in fact , genuinely committed to human rights . #% I fear that not doing this will damage Parliament 's reputation and standing , and will not be as helpful to the IGC as it could be . #% I am glad to say that I believe that the British loaf , and other items cherished in my country , can be appropriately indicated in terms of price notification . #% Yes , we need to protect our farmers in the short term against too rapid change , so that they can cope with this transition period . #% It also makes provision for public service broadcasting , an issue that we ought to be discussing more in this context , to allow governments to open up channels where they feel that public channels should be conveyed to the market place . #% We believe it more important for the EU to be delivering tangible benefits to its citizens before returning to the structural reforms for better decision-making . #% The EU and the applicant states have much to prepare before enlargement can take place . #% Frankly what I would like you to do is to press this programme as aggressively as you can because you will make the British public and the public in many other Member States so furious that when we get our chance in these ten referendums we will say no and we will say it loudly . #% So , knowing what we have gone through in the past , I am extremely pleased with what we have got for the future . #% I want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission , it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission . #% Having said that , I would just like to flag up one or two points on the amendments that have been tabled subsequent to the amendments being passed by the committee . #% The third thing which struck us is that , though President Lukaschenko seems to be determined to reunite his country with Russia , the question of reunification with Russia did not feature in any of the questions in the referendum as it is uncertain whether or not the population of Belarus will be invited to pass their comment on whether or not they wish to be reunited with Russia . #% Funding for its emergency operation is still under 50 % and $ 29.6 million are still needed to deliver the aid required . #% Here we are in 1996 , but 1992 's single market still has not arrived . #% I do not wish to delay , and neither did the Foreign Affairs Committee at any moment wish to delay , the delivery of aid to Bosnia or indeed to delay this regulation . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his learned and thoughtful report and commend his European vision . #% Spied on by teenage boys , women are marched to hospital and forced to undergo abusive gynaecological examinations to prove their chastity . #% Since then , I have had lengthy deliberations and negotiations with Commission staff , whom I thank for their time , with the French Presidency , which prioritised this report , and indeed latterly with the Swedish Presidency , which has equally been generous with its time and energy . #% I want to refer to the political position here . #% So a system that is already inherently bad becomes even worse . #% As an aside , it is curious that it is mainly women who have stayed for this debate . #% Two years ago I spoke in the debate on the annual legislative programme on behalf of the Liberal Group , and I was very critical of the old process which I described as the swapping of shopping lists between Parliament and Commission . #% We called for urgent measures to alleviate the impact of commodity price instability in ACP countries . #% We want to control our own borders and decide who lives , works and settles in our country . #% It changed the way many people thought . #% The key is clearly vaccines , and it is the new vaccines we will need , once we know the strain . #% I am also glad Commissioner Bonino is here now to hear her colleague 's answer . #% With high unemployment a factor across Europe , people are waiting for practical ways of getting them back to work . #% What we therefore have is a thoroughly unsatisfactory proposal . #% The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports this resolution and would like to echo the congratulations and welcome given to both Bulgaria and Romania ahead of accession on 1 January 2007 , whilst underlining the importance of adhering to commitments made in the Accession Treaty . #% If you had not agreed the EUR 125 million for Morocco - even before we had an agreement - we probably would not be in the position we are in now . #% Madam President , may I say that I fully endorse your speech earlier in which you said that one of our jobs is to provide the public with information about the work of the institutions . #% The active interest of this House in such activities is invaluable and we are therefore grateful to it for its continuing support and understanding . #% Allegations that such an ` Echelon network ' exists are based on hearsay and circumstantial evidence . #% In many ways Mrs Lenz has indicated that in her earlier remarks . #% I know that in this Parliament , if you criticise Belgium or the Belgians , you get fined , but I would remind you of a bit of history . #% That is one thing we can not do . #% It is clear now that the Union must move swiftly to replace the United Nations as the principal force for peace and reconciliation upon that sad , divided island . #% on behalf of the Group PSE . - This is an important and timely debate . #% The United States is blocking plans to halve the number of people who lack sanitation - two fifths of the population of the planet - while 2.4 billion do not have any sanitation , not even a bucket to use , in a world where that is one of the main causes of disease . #% Mr President , I am sorry that President Barroso has been summoned by the Belgian authorities . #% We have an interim solution which is , as I announced , the waiver for 2004 although , obviously , we will require Council understanding and consent . #% Sometimes , however , it can release dangerous chemicals , such as dioxins , into the atmosphere . #% Concerning organic farming and organic products , I want to stress that people are increasingly buying organic produce , which is to be welcomed . #% Madam President , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I thank the rapporteur , Mr McCartin for his report and efforts and , in particular , for the way in which he highlighted the major concern of my committee , namely the slow rate of implementation of the Community 's structural funds . #% For this key reason I oppose Turkish accession . #% Otherwise the belated decision which the Commission took on 14 March to exclude Argentine produce would make no sense . #% Mr President , this Constitution does not reflect the thoughts , hopes and aspirations of ordinary people . #% However , there are some important exceptions to this general rule . #% The prosaic and everyday nature of the scene of bustling shoppers and market stalls contrasted brutally with the clear-up operation that was taking place , with human remains being scraped off the canopies of the market stalls . #% Some of the practices of industrialised farming have threatened us all . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report today as it signals another step in the right direction in the fight against climate change . #% 
It is here that most migrants arrive . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , credit rating agencies sold their souls to the devil some years ago when they started to rely on those companies whose bonds needed grading for payment . #% I do not think it is in the remit of this report or this place or the Commission to ask for that . #% Recognising that we even have weak Member States amongst the current 15 , we have sensibly given derogations . #% Ruslan Sharipov is a journalist who wrote about police and government corruption . #% Our job is to bring all 15 Member States together so that the process of traceability throughout the whole of the food chain , from the birth of the animal to its slaughter and disposal , would be universally applied throughout the European Union . #% Commissioner , on this regulation , in introducing new comitology we remain furthest apart . #% We have a lead in Europe but we are not encouraging that . #% They have not taken their information from so-called ` misleading press releases ' -- despite the predictable spin from Mr Hughes and his Socialist colleagues -- but straight from the directive . #% However , as speakers have already said , there are huge difficulties in that area . #% I hope that you will agree , Commissioner , that in the context of helping more women into the labour market , and in the context of helping people with the important role of childcare , that there are indeed many roads to Paradise - and there is not just the one road that we should exclusively concentrate upon . #% I regret that , after such long negotiations , my group can not accept the negotiated position because , while we do not object in theory to such a directive , it certainly does not meet the standards that we set at the beginning . #% One of them carries the efforts of Turkey to create a viable form of European Islam , where the Prophet meets the Enlightenment . #% However , we feel that the Palestinian people -- especially the women -- should be proud . #% Their message is perfectly clear : there is still a great deal of work to be done . #% As a result , many of the animals we eat are also suffering ill-health , and cruel conditions as well in many cases . #% I appreciate that we have a set of rules under the World Trade Organization but it has repeatedly been the position of this House , both in September last year when the actions of the Commission were condemned , and in my own report on codes of conduct of multinational companies , to say that we must use trading relations through the WTO to uphold trading which is ethical , and respects the environment and human rights . #% In those circumstances , the exception that allows DEHP and other phthalates to be used ` where such a restriction would have a negative impact on medical treatment ' is entirely appropriate . #% That is perhaps partly behind the Commissioner 's principles . #% I think there was an implicit acknowledgement of that in the President-in-Office 's references to moderate pay increases . #% I shall just mention a couple more . #% All this exacerbates Israel 's persistent defiance of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July , which heavily criticised the illegal separation wall in Eastern Jerusalem . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I am sorry to delay the House when I know there is a large amount of voting to go on . #% They should be at the heart of Europe 's attempt to support new employment , to combat discrimination and to facilitate change in the economy which is sensitive to need and fair to those in work . #% I wanted to ask you specifically : is the Commission prepared to be flexible about the start time , end time and terms of these negotiations ? #% The Serbian and federal authorities have indicated their intention to urgently re-examine the cases of those not covered by the law , particularly to ascertain whether the convictions are sound or not . #% I am not sure your answer will satisfy my constituent , Mrs P. Adams of Nantwich , in several respects . #% We need to review the whole idea of having third country agreements . #% Finally , I should like to thank the Belgian presidency for the energetic and determined way they pursued agreement on this dossier . #% I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member , but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted , and every single one of those requests has been met , and met with alacrity . #% Finally , Amendment No 10 proposes the use of area closures to protect species which accumulate particularly densely in certain areas at certain times of the year . #% I hope that this support and understanding will continue . #% The implementation of the 1976 Directive has taken 30 years at least and cost a lot of money . #% That ship unloaded 500 tonnes of chemical waste into trucks which dumped it in 15 separate sites around Abidjan , a city of 5 million people . #% Each of those proposals has been rejected by that same intransigent leadership at the LTTE . #% I commend Mr Paasilinna 's report to you . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Lamassoure on his work these last few months and on the remarkable result he has produced . #% The decision by the US to classify them in this way is , therefore , not vindictive but practical and necessary , but it exposes the inadequacy of the anachronistic international jurisprudence in this area . #% We should also appeal to the 94 % of people who do not give blood to do so in future . #% But even in the United Kingdom half of invoices are still paid late . #% Unfortunately , the glass increasingly seems to be half-empty , rather than half-full . #% Perhaps it is the abuse , I do not know . #% I welcome the committee 's proposals on bus and coach services , provided that we can differentiate between the leisure industry and the express-coach industry . #% Dockers could lose their jobs , the security systems could break down and the safety issue would be jeopardised . #% But , on this issue , I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council . #% Indeed , some of those that have been returned were sent back wearing flak jackets and helmets , which , to me , says it is not exactly a safe area . #% Thirdly , in my view , as a matter of utmost importance , the Commission must apply far greater urgency in its efforts to achieve a positive statement of assurance . #% Unless it is tackled urgently , it will continue to be an area of friction as we look at the enlargement process . #% Mr President , colleagues , not since the spread of universal suffrage in the last century has our society faced such a big potential transfer of power . #% I thank Mr Viola for his report . #% That is why , with the help of some of my colleagues from across the political spectrum , I have submitted an amendment to have this proposal rejected in its entirety . #% I do not intend to use my full five minutes . #% We look forward to continued close cooperation with the European Parliament as we take our human rights work forward in the months ahead . #% Mr President , as the joint initiator and author of this question , perhaps I might be allowed to say a brief word . #% It is a circular argument . #% Fishermen in the UK , particularly along the south coast in the 10 metre boats , are often badly affected by imbalanced quotas and subsidies to other national fishing fleets . #% This is , of course , first-class news because these courts do not contribute to justice ; they do not contribute to security . #% Mr President , he is speaking on the wrong paragraph . #% The Third World needs as big a share of world trade as anyone else , but the current regime of tariffs and subsidies stifles it . #% Apart from Gibraltar , where safeguarding the apes might be a welcome way of deflecting a Spanish threat , Europe has no great apes . #% This directive would of course not affect that , but it could potentially remove places where people could get those instruments repaired and maintained . #% So , I wish the final report had been stronger on these crucial areas but I also recognise that this version now has a political value in EU relations with the peoples concerned . #% Both the Commission and the Parliament are doing their work . #% The changes we have seen as a result of Parliament 's efforts are extremely welcome and have considerably improved the proposal . #% We are a non-racist , non-sectarian , democratic political party , but one which dares to say that carrying on with European integration without the wholehearted consent of the people of Europe is a dangerous thing . #% On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet , at the very same time , the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging . #% 
Whilst labelling might be one possible improvement , my understanding , as other speakers have said , is that the best answer would be a ban on the adding of water above , say , 15 % . #% It is perhaps dangerous for a politician to advise other politicians to study history , because we all have our favourite national historians . #% Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has referred already to the position of small shopkeepers in the United Kingdom and I shall come back to that . #% Their relatives are faced with appalling bureaucracy through which they have to wade . #% Our young people are Europe 's future . #% I am very much against this proposal . #% So I invite her to support an idea of mine , which is that we should take to naming hurricanes after oil companies . #% Economists like the American Jeremy Sachs admit that development assistance to Africa to date has been peanuts when measured against the scale of infrastructure investment that is required . #% Earlier , you called Mr Heaton-Harris to speak for the Budgetary Control Committee and he was not here , and he is still not here . #% I want us to move up from 20 % to 30 % . #% I would ask you to vote against this directive , but knowing your insatiable appetite for more and more legislation , I know I am wasting my breath . #% In the case of SkyEurope , it was an airline based in Slovakia . #% We therefore wish for the European Parliament to be fully involved in future work on that . #% EU criticism of human rights in China is a good thing in itself . #% For too long sporting activities have come second to so-called formal education . #% Under Maastricht it was possible for the Council to opt out and unilaterally adopt its own text , challenging Parliament to reject that text . #% There is already a problem of terminology about what we call these acts , but nonetheless when we , as Parliament , and the Council , as a legislative authority , delegate powers to the Commission , currently exercised in the context of the comitology system , we need some fundamental change , some further steps forward on what has been agreed so far . #% I do hope that does not mean that we are going to see a European Union regulation restricting us all to living in bungalows . #% Why can we never actually get results that matter to our citizens ? #% He believes in the Stalinist saying that it does not matter how the voting is conducted , but who controls the count . #% Mrs Schreyer , we insist that the Commission must fulfil these promises . #% For example , if a particular Member State 's government was determined to use its resources to create positive jobs , and that involved what could be considered a breach of the Maastricht criteria , would that kind of determination be regarded as unacceptable by the Commission and the Council itself ? #% Dear colleagues , this is the business of Iraq . #% Evidence from disabled people shows that they are denied the rights taken for granted by non-disabled citizens , such as free movement , access to goods and services and , in some cases , even the basic right to vote . #% That is no condemnation of the President-in-Office , for whom I have great regard . #% What we have here is a very clear view of principle . #% Firstly , can the Commission confirm whether Mr Fléchard is related in any way to Mr Delors and/or members of his cabinet ? #% Accidents and acts of God do happen , and we can not guarantee to prevent them . #% I am pleased that the committee has approved the report , after much deliberation , and I know , through colleagues from right across the committee , the painstaking work that was done to try and come forward with something that was acceptable . #% Of course , the health and well-being of our citizens is of paramount importance . #% We have a right and a duty now to set society straight and to put our own house in order . #% The other issue we have to address is the ability of investors to make satisfactory returns on their investment . #% The US view is clearly that free trade is a one-way street for a superpower : good for US exporters , but not so good for US domestic industry . #% I should also like to thank the Secretariat and I extend my special thanks to the European Disability Forum . #% We recall that on 20 August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait in a unilateral act of aggression that was universally condemned . #% The concern is that the food distribution is not reaching those in the greatest need , especially children under five , and the food being distributed is not appropriate for the young children and infants who are the main victims of this current epidemic . #% I welcome the Commission 's urgent attention to the crisis . #% British ports use their initiative and investors ' money to create competitive advantage : the very opposite of a level playing field . #% Mr President , I have protested in this Chamber on every available occasion about this unnecessary piece of legislation . #% In view of the Community ' s normal legislative practice , I am somewhat surprised that it was not felt that this should be achieved by going with the grain of the established legal and administrative mechanisms of each Member State . #% On second thoughts , the markets could find solutions to the single currency issue , as we found in September 1992 . #% It is likely that the charges of unnatural sex acts and corruption are fabrications to justify his removal and imprisonment while the real motive is to remove a rival when the Prime Minister 's standing has been shaken by the Far East economic crisis . #% It is good to be back for what is my last week in this Parliament - or any parliament . #% The growth of trade with China constitutes both an important boost to employment and an opportunity to further develop the maritime sector to ensure even more trade is by sea . #% Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing . #% The World Bank is including poverty reduction programmes in its plans , and is expressing concern about countries such as Tanzania which spend more on debt servicing than either health or education . #% Mr President , last week the whole Parliament was treated to a very grand press release from Mr Adamos Adamou , MEP . #% They object to family unity . #% Mr President , the Minister has given the right answer . #% Are you aware , Sir , that the leader of the British Conservative Party has said that we have reached the limits of European integration ? #% If we can unlock this problem for small businesses in the European Union , the dividends in terms of jobs and getting our people back to work will be absolutely enormous . #% I am sorry , however , that we are told repeatedly in our committee that we can not mention human rights abuses within the European Union . #% That is certainly essential . #% Beijing will undoubtedly dismiss our concerns in this Parliament as an unwarranted intrusion into their internal affairs , but a fresh and more relaxed approach to Tibet by the PRC could well pay dividends for China 's internal security as well as its external image in the world . #% I would like to pick up on some of the lessons that I learned . #% This is stated quite simply in the first three paragraphs of Mrs Buitenweg 's report . #% Tourism means jobs . #% Conflict has dominated the trade agenda too . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Professor Friedmann and his colleagues for the annual report and the DAS . #% It is in this context , too , that we must today condemn the pattern of threats and attacks against the media in Peru , which seek only to report freely and fairly on the abuses that have taken place . #% He makes it clear that European citizenship not only supplements and complements national citizenship but also that the concept should adapt to include the rights of long-term resident foreign nationals . #% However , my group had one major problem with it over the support for the rigidity of the stability and growth pact . #% Please , Commissioner , with regard to our amendments , I would be very grateful if you could see what the Fisheries Committee is trying to achieve in this respect : fuller involvement of the European Parliament , not an attempt to take over the Commission 's negotiating mandate , but to have a real input into what is being decided . #% At a political level , the machinations of the rapporteurs are rather impressive . #% When each deal is debated , my colleague , Mr Nigel Farage , has urged you to open your eyes to the environmental destruction and , more seriously , to the deaths of many hundreds of black African fishermen which European Union boats are causing every year . #% The situation on the Korean peninsula is potentially far more dangerous than in Iraq . #% 
Perhaps instead the Commission should be banned for seven years from pronouncing on state aid and from over-regulating the business sector . #% Mr President , I do not want to follow the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights in their discussion of whether this report is in order or not . #% It wants an EU space programme linked to the security and defence policy but at the same time says that the space policy should not contribute to the militarisation and weaponisation of space . #% Until May 2005 , all newspapers had to clear articles with the Ministry of the Interior in advance of publication . #% If the Commission and the Council flout the wishes of this Parliament , then we will have dictatorial bureaucracy . #% Can they not see that it is precisely because of the old social model that Europe is today in relative economic decline ? #% It has had a terrible history , suffering particularly badly from the fallout from Chernobyl . #% We also take a different view in urging the Commission and our colleagues in Parliament to try to make progress in taxation coordination . #% We must not forget that these vehicles are essential for many users and that there are very legitimate reasons for them to be covered by these specific provisions , which have slightly higher limits to reflect the fact that emissions increase with vehicle mass . #% However , there were parts of this new legislation that were new , innovative and worthy of adoption . #% It is incredible that the Commission can , in these circumstances , record President Gayoom 's commitment to democratisation . #% We can see the limited re-use which currently exists , how it can be extended and how important it is going to be , as the previous speaker said , in the Lisbon conclusions . #% I wish the Presidency well in finding an agreement which will serve as Council 's negotiating position for the definitive negotiation with Parliament . #% How do companies actually raise debt and equity finance across the European Union ? #% . Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner and also congratulate Mr Wieland on his excellent report . #% If so , they should think again . #% Nobody has been asked whether they want it . #% There is no functional justification . #% Madam President , I wish to make a few remarks and address a few questions to the Commissioner with regard to the Trakatellis report . #% We all enjoy this , but I think we have to remember that the poorest in society , let alone the poorest across the world , are denied these opportunities . #% They are broke because of their own stupid leadership and politicians . #% Therefore , someone like yourself , Mr President , of supreme importance in the affairs of the European Union , would no doubt have been provided with two armoured cars filled to the gunnels with armed policemen with machine-guns , whereas a mere humble back-bencher like myself would be lucky to see one policeman walk past his house every other day . #% Having six different companies on the network between Birmingham and Berlin will create a complete ` dog 's breakfast ' , or should I say a ` Dachshunds Frühstück ' . #% This problem also applies to hunt kennels which feed fallen stock , and dispose of offal and - bizarrely - to pet crematoria , although I understand that human crematoria are not covered as dead people are not classified as waste . #% Many colleagues have worked together on this and it is a tribute to Mr Zappalà 's persistence that we now have a very good result . #% It is therefore crucial that Parliament accepts our amendments , particularly Amendment No 123 , for an overall , final maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for fattening . #% Now Mr Blair wants to embroil the British nation in yet another lie and fantasy . #% The pattern of the voting list is slightly convoluted because the text is complicated and what is proposed deals with drafting points . #% It will certainly become an important part of the regulatory regime for the biotechnology industry . #% That means supporting children in need because of illness , or disability or hunger or poverty or lack of educational opportunities . #% I congratulate Mr Goodwill , who has written a good report and taken on board many of the comments and remarks made by colleagues . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , in generations to come , children will be told a story . #% So there is a very real concern among SACU countries that these products will undercut local goods in their own markets . #% Amendments Nos 58 and 59 are there to try to regularise and give status to those who serve us as individual MEPs . #% In recognising the determination of the European Union and its Member States to safeguard its citizens from acts of terrorism , we stress the need to reassure the public by striking the right balance between vigilance and enabling everyday life to continue . #% I lament the fact that the British Government has failed to reach a bilateral agreement with Spain on this issue . #% Self-evidently , prevention is the first priority and in any event , pollution should be kept to a minimum . #% Mr Medina said earlier that some of the amendments that went through committee weakened the Commission 's original proposal . #% Will the development of our trade with Russia simply strip that country of its natural resources for the lowest possible price ? #% We are witnessing serious under-performance by standards which Europe 's socialist leaders have set themselves . #% I thank my colleagues Mr Ford , Mr Thomas , Mr Needle and Mrs Malone for bringing back information concerning the famine in North Korea and for alerting us to the plight of starving children there . #% Yesterday , on a state visit to Georgia , President Bush called for freedom and democracy everywhere in the Communist world . #% Then we joined the EC , and that all changed . #% We do not want to see this extended to fattening pigs and calves . #% It is quite clear that our parliamentary colleagues on those bodies look to this Parliament and the European Union to provide a robust and functioning Northern Dimension policy . #% A recent development report of the United Nations detailed the prevalence of world poverty and stated that 358 billionaires owned capital equivalent to the annual income of nearly half the world 's population . #% The questions we will be asking concern the significant rise of 780 in staffing numbers and , in particular , whether we need so many civil servants in the interpretation and translation departments . #% Everyone should be treated equally across the EU . #% This war must end . #% Indeed , many aircraft accidents are survivable . #% I also want to put to her the results of that survey which show that 40 % of people entering temporary work come from the pool of long-term unemployed and 40 % get permanent jobs within a year . #% Ports such as Newhaven will be given the welcome boost that they so badly need to try and secure a role in the future . #% Take the example of the vibrations directive . #% All of us know that Parliament has received a number of petitions from bar organisations around Europe . #% The procedure would be rarely deployed , but it represents a significant insurance scheme to see that the Union authorities do not abuse their reinforced powers . #% Otherwise world prosperity will be seriously threatened in the longer term . #% I therefore ask the Commission if it has done any analysis on what the cost would be if there was to be instability in Macedonia ; and to what extent - to take him up on his last point - it is true that we need to ensure there is stability in Albania in order to maintain stability in FYROM . #% We are now seeing a United States Congress that is increasingly protectionist . #% They recognise that you can not say you are upholding international law by breaking international law . #% Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we can not deny that occasionally , we do have differences of opinion . #% We have to continue to exercise it in the fashion familiar to the House . #% I would also like to make the point that I am delighted that my amendment to the Corbett report , taking written declarations outside of the plenary , has now come of age . #% Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring ? #% We have used very strong words , ' is concerned that the Commission 's proposal to negotiate regional free trade economic partnership agreements may be premature , impractical and lead to increased poverty and social tension in the ACP states ' . #% The groups have to meet . #% It is understandable that border controls with Egypt will require Israeli and international monitoring for security reasons for some time to come . #% 
My group believes that so long as consumer interests can be asserted and maintained as an essential element of the provisions of this report , then it is obviously going to be willing to withdraw any amendments that might suggest derogations or deletions to the country - of-origin principle . #% If I were to describe Mr Lannoye , whom I hold in esteem as an ` industrial Belgian ' , it would be a meaningless phrase . #% Mr Posselt , who spoke just a moment ago , was far too negative . #% As far as I am aware , that money has not yet been paid . #% When I was in Serbia last October , I was impressed with the commitment and effort of Serbia 's dynamic , western-orientated democratic government . #% I hope the Commission takes these points on board . #% I am speaking particularly on behalf of the UK PSE delegation in order to say that we will not be supporting this report for many of the reasons that Mr Katiforis has already outlined . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Commissioner , thank you for your statement . #% It is quite clear that Parliament must get its own house in order after the agreements we have had vis-à-vis the Commission . #% The new legal base , which was not really what we wanted , relies on the European Union 's competence on health and it must not restrict the scope of the Daphne programme . #% That is why I welcome the safeguards that the Commission has announced . #% If the Council and the Commission did not feel moved to act before , then it is certainly time to act now , before the Mugabe regime destroys all hope for what is potentially one of the most prosperous countries in Africa . #% Mauritania , for example , is dependent on its fishing industry for half of its exports , which represent 15 % of its GDP . #% General Budget for 2002 #% The basis is Article 138 , which was previously Article 118a - and if I am right , we must look into the costs - administrative and otherwise - for small-to-medium-sized businesses , as laid down in the Treaty already . #% I can not quite marry your concern for women with what is happening in Portugal , where some women are being prosecuted for carrying out abortions . #% Has the Commission adopted security rules ? #% Their impact has been substantial and , in this context , I would like to pay particular tribute to our friend , Jaime Mayor Oreja , one of Parliament 's most influential personalities . #% My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of Austria ' s Freedom Party . #% Batom Mitee , brother of the acting president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People ( Mosop ) told The Times : ' Farmers are struggling for land and space with oil exploration . #% Mr President , we have a long catalogue of action by the Council and the Commission to deal with the problem of counterfeiting of the euro . #% And sustainable development I would like to point out is not the same as sustainable growth which we have been hearing a lot about this afternoon . #% There is a big debate in the European Union about whether or not we need labour market flexibility . #% We need to ensure that custody orders in the court of one Member State are not defied by the illegal abduction of children to the jurisdiction of another country , sometimes even another Member State . #% As we approach a new millennium , maybe we can start a new trend towards ensuring that such laws will be universally enforced and applied . #% Temporary means temporary . #% I hope that the Commissioner will agree with our argument that we should give the motorists a choice . #% But others in this House are straining to carve a new and retrograde path in the social field . #% We have a moral duty to embrace the people of Eastern and Central Europe who lived under a cruel and alien tyranny for so long . #% I believe that he is correct in arguing that many of us tend to stick with comfortable old ways , rather than addressing the difficult adjustments to the law that we may need to make vis-à-vis the balance we have to strike between human rights and the security of our public . #% We recognise that some documents should and must remain confidential and classified , but what must not happen is that legitimate reasons of security , public safety and public protection are used to hide the merely embarrassing and misjudged . #% Regarding category 5 : how do we fit everything into the existing ceilings ? #% I do not think the amendments are necessary . #% The process would be exactly the same , though a bit later . #% Mr President , I understand that at the beginning of today 's sitting a point was raised about the travel office and the fact that the current staff are to make way for a new company . #% Secondly , the quality of aid . #% A good case already exists for claiming that some of the machinery involved could well cope with higher speeds than are proposed in this directive . #% But in the face of these disappointments , you have brought forward more intensive , traditional controls based on cooperation , information exchange and data access . #% It seems to me that low-volume cars are often high-spec cars with all kinds of features and I wonder what the Commission thinks about the amendment to somehow exempt them from the requirement of having sound technology for mobile air-conditioning . #% I would like to accompany my congratulations to the Council with a warning to future presidencies about the dangers and the consequences of recidivism . #% We are therefore trying to suck in the health workers from other countries in order to deal with our own problems . #% But we will be savage critics of those who prefer narrow self-interest and threaten the accession of new Member States . #% I think that loyalty was misplaced and has resulted in much of the delay . #% in writing . - I voted to change the rules on vaccination against bluetongue disease in order to allow the use of more effective vaccines and to reduce red tape for farmers . #% I believe that Mr Putin will win the presidential election , and that we must recognise his democratic mandate to rebuild a strong Russian state . #% It is therefore vital that working hours are monitored and that employers are prevented from exploiting youngsters at work . #% We would oppose money being allocated to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as we would oppose money being allocated to all EU funds . #% There must be some organization , planning and control of the levels of immigration that we can sustain . #% The common European interest will only be fostered if all those who share executive power - the European Council and also the Commission - collaborate with all those that share legislative power - the European and national parliaments . #% We in Europe should aid that . #% Mr President , we find ourselves once again debating the situation of human rights in the world . #% If someone becomes sensitized to nickel , then , of course , if they ever come into contact with it subsequently , they can be subject to a very severe reaction . #% I regret his understandable view that the Commission , to use his term , is hiding the internal audit report from Parliament . #% Those elections must be genuinely free and fair . #% In response to the particular questions of the honourable Member , the Member States of the Union have not informed the Commission of their actions taken following receipt of the Regional Environmental Centre report . #% In these circumstances , I believe that , if such products go to a retail outlet or a restaurant , there is a difference . #% Then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected . #% But perhaps I am a hopeless optimist . #% The Commission has allowed members of the Committee on Petitions - but only members - to see the actual questionnaire , and then only under extremely stringent conditions . #% Passengers will be entitled to refreshments in the case of short delay , a refund for over 2 hours ' delay , and up to EUR 1 200 for lost or damaged luggage . #% Anyone who has watched the Prime Minister preside over this presidency will surely understand my caution . #% Above all , my correspondents tell me that they are fed up with the EU 's mania for bombarding the consumer with information . #% I hear what various colleagues have said on this subject and particularly welcome the comments made by the rapporteur herself , that this regulation might not be the right place to address that . #% You can have all the weapons in the world , but you will be unable to defend yourself against a few people armed with box cutters . #% But who knows , Mr Chichester , maybe even the world of commerce would benefit from the improved intelligence such a centre could provide . #% Whilst we move towards extrajudicial remedies , we must also ensure that judicial remedies are accessible . #% 
A woman may be desirable but another dopey set of rules for harmonising the way we deal with batteries and accumulators -- I think not . #% The welcome failure of the Constitution should have presented an opportunity for genuine reflection by the leaders of the European nations on the nature and direction of the European Union . #% Like my colleague Mr van den Berg , I am very keen to know where the EUR 1 billion promised by President Barroso at Gleneagles is going to come from . #% So why does the Right ignore this ? #% We need to have the information in place and we need the legal base which will allow us in future to have a proper concern for consumer matters . #% This is a most serious distortion of the level playing field , particularly if the money is then to be used to gain a share in other utility markets . #% We need to work together with major consuming countries such as the US , China , Russia and Japan to tackle this problem and to set up a global alert system and register of illegal logging and countries of concern using Interpol , an appropriate UN body utilising the latest satellite technology systems . #% We must not lose sight of our objective in relation to the Cotonou Agreement of poverty eradication and sustainable development . #% I welcome the communication from the European Commission , which aims to remove trade-distorting subsidies from the EU sugar regime . #% I recently talked to a group about how best to solve that problem and they told me that , in general , politicians were seen to be boring , grey and used language that is completely out of date . #% I personally salute Unison , the trade union , for campaigning on this issue . #% Africa is at the top of the agendas of today 's meeting of G8 leaders at Gleneagles and of the UK Presidency of the EU . #% If that is not possible - and plainly it is not : even Mr Happart had to accept , however much he deplored it , that the Committee on Agriculture was prepared to accept 5 % of vegetable fats throughout the European Union - the fall-back position is to go to Mrs Thyssen who has had two bites of this cherry-flavoured chocolate already . #% I was particularly pleased that the amendments seeking to abolish the lump sum payments that are very common in British pension funds were dropped . #% I also hope that the interim arrangements the Commission has suggested will commend themselves to the House . #% Those of us who really care know the great difficulties of this subject . #% I very much welcome what the Commissioner had to say about the actions that had been taken by the British Government . #% Given Mr Poggiolini 's comments earlier , perhaps we can make a plea to the services of this Parliament that we occasionally have a debate on health issues that takes place during the daytime rather than late at night . #% For instance , we must drop the requirement for Cypriots to have Greek mother tongue in order to be officials in the EU institutions . #% Finally , I see that among the Manzella amendments you have accepted , quite rightly , an amendment to delete text . #% Speaking as a lawyer and a former Justice Minister in the United Kingdom , I have questions to ask Mr Frattini , and I will do so in an unemotional way , because I think this is a very interesting debate . #% I note with concern the determination of the euro-integrationists to reintroduce a European Constitution by 2009 , to spend more public money on propaganda campaigns to support this objective , and to introduce geographical and political limitations on the EU . #% Fine words are one thing , making sure that in practice disabled people are treated exactly the same as everyone else is another . #% We can hinder that process by failing to put our own House in order over the common agricultural policy and over budget reform . #% I congratulate my colleague , Mrs Jackson on her continuing interest in this critical area for the future of mankind . #% Improving people 's knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine can be an important way of enabling them to make more responsible and better informed choices about their health . #% He had to meet a four o'clock deadline , but he will read the Commissioner 's reply in the transcripts tomorrow with great interest . #% In considering the whole issue of product liability we have to say that the current directive appears to have functioned well . #% However , I would argue , as I am sure many speakers in the debate would argue , that trade liberalisation is not a panacea for generating the kind of self-sustaining growth and poverty reduction that we want to see as a result of our policies - we are talking about coherence here - let alone the objective that we have of promoting human development . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 22 November last year , the rapporteur said that pensions were exclusively a competence of the Member State . #% And , when I say that the Commission took that view , I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler , who is from Austria ; and who , once again , demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission , under oath , in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning . #% The EU Heads of State or Government at the Lisbon and Stockholm Summits aimed to create the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world , capable of sustainable economic growth accompanied by quantitative and qualitative improvement of employment and of greater social cohesion . #% If growth is quantitative and not qualitative I would submit that we are actually creating instability by making money out of oil spills , clearing up after crime etc. . #% The Commission will continue its efforts motivated by the hope that the tension can be reduced . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their statements . #% It is unacceptable that somebody should have fewer legal rights if they are charged with an offence in a country other than their own than they would in their own country . #% Madam President , I refer to something which was not in the Minutes of the Friday of the previous part-session because I was not able to put my point . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to thank Commissioner McCreevy for fully living up to the pledge that he gave to us . #% Mr Anwar and his friends are by no means the first politicians to suffer at the hands of the Malaysian authorities . #% I would like to congratulate in advance those Member States that will meet their obligations under this directive for all sectors . #% If you do not have that information I would be very grateful if you could let me have it in writing . #% This often causes , for prolonged periods of time , massive social and economic problems in countries , many of which are already amongst the poorest in the world and suffering from the ravages of long-term war and disease . #% The second area of concern to us , where we were in line with a number of other committees , is the issue of jurisdiction . #% Mr President , yesterday we heard Mr Chirac set out his objectives for the French presidency . #% The ELDR Group has consistently welcomed the progress made over the last few years in the way in which the Commission has presented this important document . #% That was last December . #% Are some still saying that they will put this material into landfill ? #% Mr Cars is absolutely right ; we should be working in partnership with all 26 national parliaments . #% No good can come from driving Palestine into financial chaos and ruin . #% I recently represented the Socialist Group in Romania , and was singularly impressed by the progress that is being made under the current government , which has finally got to grips with some of the issues . #% It would perhaps therefore not be appropriate to delete such a symbolic procedure . #% The European Arrest Warrant has tremendous potential for abuse and for use against political dissidents . #% The first of the eight joint actions , the eight core challenges , referred to the point of promoting employment , though it was in recital V in the report . #% US domestic political ideology is in conflict with American security interests . #% What are we going to do if we get a hoped-for peace agreement in the Middle East ? #% It is fair to say that Tajikistan 's record in democratisation and human rights is imperfect , but I am convinced that dialogue and engagement on the EU 's part will encourage Tajikistan towards positive change . #% He should therefore tell us what is really going on . #% Violent suppression of a peaceful movement in favour of democratic reform in Indonesia , with arrests , restrictions on journalists , injuries and deaths , is something to which this Parliament must react . #% Yet this report goes deeper than just imposing direct charges on the public . #% There are still 15,000 or 16,000 cases per year of salmonella food poisoning in the UK , half the previous levels . #% There should also , wherever possible , be a freedom of choice as to the method of implementation as is , for instance , the case in connection with the open coordination method in the employment and social field . #% Indeed one would hope that people will be able to spot the difference between that and other ideas about compulsion . #% The second issue I wish to raise is that of Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act . #% If it does the latter it can apply the measure provisionally , if this is necessary to avoid a legal vacuum , or not if that is not necessary . #% Apart from that , this is a reasonably sensible directive , to protect people like welders from artificial radiation , but we should not include natural radiation from the sun . #% The second example is the European Food Safety Authority , which is expected to move to Parma . #% 
It is not a military , rapid reaction force , which is , of course , second pillar , and driven by the Council of Ministers . #% I fear we are doing neither . #% Mr President , after reading the reports on the proposed budget for 2005 , I can not help but wish that they could also be read by those useful idiots back home , upon whom the British Government so often relies , who keep telling us that the EU is not about creating a giant single State . #% Unlike Sir Neil MacCormick , I think it is right that the task of implementation should be given to the Bureau , because the Bureau is elected by the House as a whole . #% The United Nations inspires me and all of us here in Europe . #% We can only hope that the Czech presidency will be a little more sceptical of the great European project than some previous presidencies . #% Sadly , perfection often eludes us in human endeavours , whether by politicians or anyone else . #% In the tradition of British governments since 1972 , it is almost certain that Mr Blair will surrender the British national interest -- in this case the budget rebate -- while no doubt still finding a way of trumpeting it as a triumph of diplomacy . #% Another point about the objective of the communication is that it needs to be more explicitly aimed at reducing ship emissions of greenhouse gases in particular , looking especially at the impact on global warming . #% Bulgaria 's accession process has not always been a smooth one . #% Parliament 's amendments emphasise individual producer responsibility so that none can escape the net of the directive , but this means changing existing collective responsibility systems . #% Mr President , this is a very important report and it approaches a difficult subject . #% This delay has no real justification or apparent basis , according to my reading of the Treaties . #% Mr President , Mr Jarzembowski observes in his explanatory statement that we have to strengthen rail transport , to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of railways in order to reverse the downward trend of their share in the market in the last 15 years . #% It is right to say that so far the reflection has been less about the text and more about the context . #% What we have had ever since 2008 is repeated hesitation and internal wrangling between Member States and the institutions , and each time , a painfully extracted response - but produced too late and constituting less than what was required . #% Mr President , I speak in support of the Roth-Behrendt report and congratulate the rapporteur on the quality and thoroughness of her report . #% It is why Europe rightly champions UN policies : the 0.7 % target in the Millennium Goals within EU development policy , and Europe providing over half of all support to the UN High Commission for Refugees , which stands up for fundamental rights as a bulwark against the racism and xenophobia now sweeping our continent . #% As others have said , that is not the only way in which we should be looking at this issue , if we should be looking at it that way at all . #% This new regime means that every document is considered on a case-by-case basis without blanket exceptions and documents concerning security and defence are by no means excluded from the Regulation . #% Recitals F and G mistakenly blame market fragmentation for Europe 's military weakness and lack of interoperability . #% I therefore share the view of Mrs Lynne that this Question Time has not been long enough given the importance of the subject . #% My government says that the rebate is non-negotiable . #% It will completely undermine the efforts of colony egg producers in the UK . #% At that stage barely any Europeans were interested in the process of economic and monetary union . #% This was done last year in protest , after Mr Castro imprisoned 75 dissidents and human rights activists and executed three ferry highjackers fleeing the island . #% So I have brought her this evening a modest proposal which I invite her to support . #% In fact those in France who have studied the subject in depth may well decide to buy British as the safest and tastiest option . #% Finally , it is vital that we have proper protection for freedom of speech and for journalists . #% Comprehensive means all-encompassing ; it does not mean riddled with exceptions . #% In many respects this directive has two purposes , both to regulate the industrial market and also to protect the environment . #% Forty per cent of European groundwater is already well over the standard set in the Florenz amendments . #% If we permit unjustified surveillance , detention and discrimination against minorities , especially Muslims , we will weaken our moral credibility as well as foster more terrorism . #% Our citizens have a right to receive equal legal protection wherever they are in the European Union . #% That would allow us to clamp down on real football hooligans ; football fans who are innocent would not be caught in a trap . #% It is specifically for the purpose of enlargement that openness is necessary . #% It is puzzling why the Commission and Council are promoting a new agreement on access to SWIFT financial data on EU citizens when the Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement allows for specific requests . #% That is a question which my German colleagues who are moving the other question want to follow up . #% Can I just , in finishing , say that we will have started four new programmes by the end of this year - Media , Culture 2000 , Youth and Socrates . #% It has certainly been interesting working with him for the last two and a half years , if only because I never knew what he would be getting up to next . #% We also believe that the establishment of regional advisory panels will do much to encourage responsible conservation measures , although the role of such councils needs some clarification . #% I also said that we need only one reading of the budget , and that would simplify the whole process . #% That is a fundamental principle for us which we hope will be fully respected in the next round . #% In other words , that they should apply not just to those people who are in work , not just to those people who are not able to work , but also to those people who want to work but are unable to find work because there are too many obstacles in their way . #% If this ambiguity is not clarified , then we risk seeing dramatic variability in the application of the directive . #% To understand properly much of what they have said , one must consider the history . #% If every Member who has an interest is now going to get up and declare it before we start this vote , we will only start the vote at 1.00 p.m. . #% There is , on an alternative issue , a growing need to link some businesses with the research programmes . #% My way around this is to say that the funds that have not been used so far should be lost to the system . #% On the content , I hope the macroeconomic dialogue will call for and take note of evidence on the success of the active labour market measures we have been increasingly pursuing since Luxembourg . #% However , it would seem to me at the very least appropriate that we should invite Mr Rugova also to address that committee . #% It does not seem right to me that British slaughterhouses should be put through the hoops as a result of the Commission 's action whilst Spain is allowed to default on its obligations . #% My group believes that we need a comprehensive approach to this , and we are very much looking forward to the Commission White Paper on this subject . #% How exactly are the EEA negotiations progressing ? #% We have differing views across Parliament as to what should and should not be benchmarked and we need a common approach on that . #% The issue of proportional representation is far from being the only issue on which it had proved difficult to reach the necessary unanimity in the Council . #% I understand that you have today written to the Ombudsman but I wish to know when the Members of this Parliament are going to have the opportunity to respond to the Ombudsman ' s request for comments in his own-initiative inquiry . #% I hope the Commission will take these points seriously . #% Finally , let me turn to Mr Perry 's comments , put with his customary delicacy and charm and all the more forceful because they were wrapped in silk and polished with scented soap . #% However , as Mr Nassauer will know , and as we have heard in the previous debate , it is not as easy as we would like for someone to move from one EU country to another to work . #% Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise , their dynamism and their flexibility . #% Mr President , in my opinion the new agreements and renewed agreements with ACP countries require new attitudes . #% We have heard the cross-party agreement right across this Parliament this morning . #% Animals are not merely products , nor are they simply commodities . #% In conclusion , I commend this proposal to the House . #% The Commissioner himself acknowledges that it contains a lot of very broad proposals . #% 
These proposals come at a time of increased terror risk in the EU when Member States are already struggling to cope with the weight of the movement of people across the continent . #% My sources also said that he did not confess and he has never confessed to this alleged crime , despite the torture he allegedly suffered for several months before his trial . #% He should take more note of the phrase `` peacekeeping operations '' . #% It has been suggested in the media that Mr Blair allowed the rebate to be discussed when such discussions were not necessary , thereby falling into a trap laid by President Chirac who wished to distract attention from the French ` no ' vote . #% If we do not liberalise , if we do not maintain the country-of-origin principle , that 20 million will be joined by many others in the future and many others will continue to stagnate . #% We should recognise this and congratulate the Turkish authorities . #% One of the other big problems we have in making progress in certain cases , especially those relating to the environment - such as waste disposal , water quality , etc. are the delays at national level in providing information to the Commission . #% I doubt whether this proposal , in its present form , unless it is well amended , is going to be of positive benefit to the public . #% Preparatory work on the proposals is progressing under the Director-General for Administration . #% I believe that by stimulating job creation , by supporting economic growth and by encouraging global competitiveness , the European Union has the potential to make itself most relevant to the lives of the European citizens of today . #% Sports bodies have more funds , a fairer share of the money , and they are able to put that money back into the sports themselves by developing facilities and training to bring people into those sports . #% In these deliberations we need to be absolutely clear that developing countries are not asking for an ambitious programme in this round . #% Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Mr Lisi on behalf the millions of airline passengers who will benefit due to his work and that of the Parliament and the Commission . #% The Council , the Commission and Parliament should facilitate the use of unspent funds in our budget for relief . #% Perhaps , above all , it is a decision for the Member States and not for other countries to take a decision as to when a date should be set for Turkey to start negotiations . #% There are indeed political and security challenges facing the continent of Europe , but why should the European Union have an autonomous space and security and defence policy ? #% Mr President , as a new Member here , I am not rising to criticise the architecture and decoration of the building , although quite clearly I could . #% Enlargement is not only necessary , it is urgent . #% It is about ensuring that the internal market operates fairly in terms of passenger cars and that the current obstacles which are there , in part , in the range of taxation currently levied , are evened out so that the internal market in this particular area is enabled to function much better than it does at the moment . #% Mrs Fontaine says in her letter : `` I believe the time has come to provide all Members with the fullest possible details '' . #% At a time when we are pressing for support for the principle of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons it will give the impression that we are in favour of creating a nuclear Europe while objecting to others doing likewise in their areas . #% Further market reform , with the decoupling of direct payments from production and the reinforcement of rural development , is most welcome . #% That is why my Group as a whole vigorously supported the resolution that we have just adopted . #% And institutional changes do not help with climate changes . #% That is why we specifically support , in today 's resolution , condemnation of the failure of the EU 's resolution on Zimbabwe at the UNCHR last year , calling for the EU once again to co-sponsor a resolution condemning human rights abuses in Zimbabwe in Geneva this year . #% However , I agree with those who say that it is time to look at wider measures to do with suspending this EC-Israel association agreement , because that agreement contains an important human rights clause that states that if there are human rights abuses on either side of the agreement , then that agreement should be suspended . #% Some fear that Abidjan is going the way of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , a country whose skyscrapers and boulevards now lie in ruins . #% But , please , do not let us risk job losses in our own wine areas and possibly creating problems for our own bottlers by creating barriers between producers , distributors and consumers which are artificial and will damage trade within the Union . #% Mr Aznar spoke recently about the need for dialogue between the Palestinians and the Israeli government in the Middle East peace process . #% We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly . #% Fronting the legislation is Andrew Duff , a liberal democrat MEP from my own region . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his characteristically full discourse and discussion on this subject , and also for the very comprehensive material he makes available to us on the staff reform issues . #% If the President kindly agrees to write the letter as requested , she will present it with her other colleagues at the EU-ACP Assembly due to take place next week . #% We too are in favour of the scrapping of needless or redundant laws , but we do have some concerns , partly fed by the way President Barroso came out shooting from the hip in the on the subject of deregulation . #% We must take up that opportunity ; we must unite with them to push even the Americans towards some form of action . #% This is an absolutely disastrous situation ! #% We now have the evidence and the opposite is the case , because part-time work has come to be seen as a positive option . #% Step by step , Spinelli 's achievement can now be seen in perspective . #% I wish to raise one specific point which is of great importance . #% My job as rapporteur for this report , rather than as chairman , is to defend the position of the Committee on Budgets . #% For recycling , we welcome public education schemes and voluntary schemes . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I would welcome this report and the work done in particular by the rapporteur and all the others concerned to reach a first reading agreement and therefore hasten the implementation of this proposal . #% Mr Bouwman quite rightly referred to Erika . #% The PKK 's 1999 ceasefire is under strain , and only political negotiations can ensure permanent peace . #% The reality is that defence budgets are being slashed across continental Europe and even the superb British armed forces are desperately overstretched and under-equipped . #% I do not think we should criticise Member States for having those fears : it is understandable . #% This clearly expresses our joint concerns about the executions of women and , more rarely , men by the cruel and barbaric practice of stoning and about the sharp rise in the use of the death penalty in Iran over the past two years . #% This is an unnecessary and damaging measure . #% The result of that is that the democracy programmes , which we all support here , and the human rights programmes , are now dying . #% If joint ventures and bilateral projects can be developed between Latvia and the EU in the course of modernizing and privatizing the ageing Latvian fleet , this can only be beneficial to the progress of Latvia towards full European Union membership . #% We know from our Scandinavian colleagues that , provided there is good water and sewage treatment , phosphates can result in lower volumes of detergents being used and also lower water temperatures being necessary . #% We can do more by helping those countries . #% The Commission 's own research shows , for example , that the per kilometre cost of running a car in the UK under infrastructure charging would increase by 97 % by 2005 . #% However , if they are there we have to act on them -- they have to be credible . #% I also object to the undemocratic nature of Euratom decisions and the waste of resources in the boondoggle that is the ITER project . #% Can I also ask as regards compensation whether it is possible for the Commission to consider compensation , not only for those farmers that are directly hit by foot-and-mouth disease , but those that are also closed down by not being able to move their livestock ? #% The process is far from its beginning ; in fact , this time last year we were hoping it was near its end . #% If we were to take a view as a full Parliament , then we should have something more in front of us and a great deal more time and careful consideration before we enter into such a hasty vote on an issue such as this . #% I recognise that it is radically different from the one-sided version originally put before the Foreign Affairs Committee and thank those involved for those changes . #% So far , however , the employers ' organizations have consistently refused to discuss the inclusion of drivers . #% Therefore , you will have to answer three questions , and I end on this . #% I do not believe that this undermines the Council of Europe , and I fully agree with Michael Cashman on this : it intensifies the support for human rights in Europe , but we also need to include competence in relation to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty . #% These are horrors which every civilised person , government and judicial system condemns . #% We desperately need to improve road safety with safety equipment in cars , seat belt campaigns and better road signs . #% If recommendations of this kind are to be internationally effective the measures must be enforced by the body overseeing airlines , not the EU who like to dictate on all subjects , including the rules of football ! #% I certainly hope that in the next few weeks we can sort this thing out . #% 
Mr President , I should like once again to congratulate Commissioner Kinnock on bringing forward yet another proposal to enhance safety at sea . #% We have been told that , in the two years we have had as a Commission , the only reform has been to get rid of the medal for 20 years ' service . #% In Amendment No 13 , we look at the question of what I would call copycat advertising where a product which is to all intents and purposes the same - save for a single vowel or consonant - is advocated in an advert as though it were the original product . #% What is happening in France , Mr President , appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties . #% Prime Minister Berisha even interfered with the arrest , ordered by the Prosecutor-General , of guardsmen who had shot protestors , claiming that a coup d'état was imminent . #% Well , let us conduct a human audit . #% I hope that we in the EU will back those recommendations in full . #% We have heard from both the presidency of the Council here today and from the Commission that they are actively pursuing the idea . #% This would be an unnecessarily complex thing to start at a time when we will be out on election campaigns and the present Commission will be in its last year . #% If you support them we will engage with you . #% This may well give rise to endless chaos and confusion which should be avoided at all costs . #% The people have given a clear message and part of that message is that they feel alienated by the processes and by the institutions . #% Human rights have deteriorated , opposition is not tolerated , eleven former leaders of the government party have been arrested , the press is suppressed and journalists arrested . #% Paragraph 15 is inappropriate in this context . #% Tunisia plays an active role within international human rights institutions and was elected to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in April 2004 . #% However , there is also an equally important seventh question : it is the old issue about national declarations . #% Mr President , I decided to speak in this debate when I read the truly excellent analysis of the current situation in Europe produced by the European Commission before the Lisbon Summit . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner to say a little more about the PACTE programme . #% I believe the majority of the S&D Group will find those compromises acceptable to them . #% This is particularly important in the context of derivatives , where the scope of the definition of inside information would make it very difficult to hedge ordinary liabilities , relating for example to an interruption to supply or new research revealing details of potential new supplies . #% There is a lack of partnership in many areas and almost complete lack of democracy on the programme monitoring committees . #% I should mention the fundamental problem that key Commission documents are not made available to Parliament and its rapporteurs in good time . #% He was given a special award in recognition of the fact that he continued the race even though it was quite clear that his chances of winning had been spoiled . #% We have to become involved as we promised to do in the Customs Union and in the association agreement , and we must work to make Turkey ready for European Union membership , just like all the other applicant countries . #% In the last 12 months , some 200 executions are estimated to have taken place in all , 9 in public in the last week alone . #% It does seem to me that there are some people in this House who are a little bit dim in grasping that . #% Allowing service providers to operate outside their own country is integral to the EU 's single market and reducing the bureaucracy at national level can allow the directive to make a contribution to EU economic growth and its jobs objectives . #% Avian flu -- to the best of my knowledge -- is an infection of the gut , not of the respiratory tract . #% Can you imagine our financial and economic future being discussed in public houses up and down the country ? #% Parliament is being asked to approve a draft supplementary and amending budget of nearly EUR 10 million to fund staff and equipment for the separate European Union military bodies . #% It is very important that we stick to the rules , as you stated them , taking note of what Mrs Fouque had to say . #% Our whole world is now riven by conflict and insecurity , from weapons of mass destruction , which sadly do exist , to the continued act of genocide in different countries . #% It is our duty as politicians to ensure that our police , security and intelligence services are given every possible means and support for their difficult and often dangerous work , with proper safeguards for the liberties of our law-abiding citizens . #% You need to stand up to the Council . #% I note that even the executive vicepresident of Polygram - one of Europe 's leading film-makers - supported this proposal when he suggested 2 % of net profits from successful films should pass back into the fund . #% In the past , I have spoken with concern in this house on the Charter of Fundamental Rights with regard to the attempt to make binding its new controversial , social and economic rights , as opposed to the civil and political rights enshrined in the much respected 1950 European Convention of Human Rights . #% The institution has not , however , used human resources policies that are appropriate to the changing responsibilities and needs of the institution as an organisation . #% I believe it is a step forward in the security of the continent . #% Given Mr Theonas ' question , is it not the case that those weaker economies need to make sure that they have prepared fully for the single currency , so that their small and medium-sized enterprises can take full advantage of the stable and very large euro area that will be created next year ? #% The matter is , if you like , too urgent to take on board because it happened last Thursday and can not be brought forward as an urgency . #% Some of these can be big projects used for power stations , others can be small projects for local heating plants and for schools and hospitals . #% Every 30 seconds a child in Africa dies of malaria , and yet there are a number of actions that could put a complete stop to that . #% With regard to the amounts in reserve which are released : Amendment 302 to line 16 03 02 - ` Local actions ' - the reserve is lifted ; Amendment 251 on ` European Schools ' - line 26 01 50 23 ; lastly , Amendment 330 to 28 01 01 - ` Staff in active employment in the audit policy area ' . #% The man is a gangster . #% Such cooperation makes the life of a rapporteur a lot easier . #% I hope that after we have heard the Commissioner we will have the opportunity to discuss his views further and to discuss the very deeply worrying issues which delay on this regulation raises . #% The report ensures those travelling on longer-distance coach journeys across Europe have access to better information , support and compensation in case of delay or cancellation of a service . #% However , in this context I consider that my own stakeholders are my electorate . #% I want to refer in particular to the UN Development Programme . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , it is a shame that Mr Barroso has fled the Chamber . #% To have sectoral ministers suddenly , in the middle of the IGC , coming up with new points that were not even listed by their own governments as issues for discussion in the IGC represents a new threat and a new danger . #% I would also like to ensure that a range of parliamentary committees are also involved in the follow-up . #% Lesbians and gay men are ordinary men and women made extraordinary by extremists ' preoccupation with our sex lives and the defamation that lesbians and gay men are a threat to society . #% Since the numbers of people affected by asbestos are predicted to rise considerably by 2020 , legislation must be upgraded to further reduce acceptable levels of exposure . #% Such programmes need an audience to justify their raison d'être and there is no better discipline to make them seek an audience than the discipline of the marketplace . #% Mr President , I will restrict myself this evening to Mr Le Rachinel 's report on vehicle registration signs and of course I congratulate him on his efforts in producing the report . #% Recently I was in Slovenia reassuring the Slovenes that the Commission 's approach to the enlargement process was an objective approach , that each country would be judged on its merits . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , as one of the three rapporteurs who worked very closely together on the whole package - and this is clearly a package - I want to give a very warm welcome to this compromise agreement and also to add my compliments to Catherine Trautmann , who has led the negotiation with great skill . #% I find myself in rather rare agreement with Mr Hannan . #% I was therefore shocked to discover that state victimisation has been taking place against Professor Pelinka , first when Haider 's lawyer , acting as prosecutor and judge in the case of libel against Mr Haider , whom Professor Pelinka described as responsible for having made National Socialist positions and statements politically acceptable . #% Madam President , I too welcome the Commission statement , particularly as far as the optical radiation directive is concerned . #% He estimates that there are 6.8 million people in one form of detention or other in China today , many of them there for religious convictions - and we think especially here of the Falun Gong practitioners , who are blameless but who are tortured for their beliefs and , in many cases , are dying . #% It does not exactly trip off the tongue , does it ? #% Should there not be some coordination ? #% Secondly , it is important to support the exemptions included in the Commission proposal for universities , libraries and museums across the European Union . #% All of us , Commissioners , Ministers , and parliamentarians want to be able to endorse those words . #% 
As far as we are concerned , whatever our political positions , we need to have sensible and progressive reform . #% Mr President , these proposals for the training of heavy goods vehicle drivers are , like much of the legislation adopted by this House , totally unnecessary . #% It was conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system , which is inherently unfair and is no longer defensible in the 21st century . #% To adopt a child in the UK , checks and vetting procedures are robust , and prospective parents need to be accepted by an adoption agency . #% We have just heard a sample . #% Designed to conserve fish stocks , this misbegotten scheme has reduced some species to near extinction . #% This would ensure that they do not forget this and substitute some inadequate plane that is unable to take everybody . #% Having said that , we are happy to accept the compromises . #% We need the European Council to agree collectively on how to proceed . #% It is fundamental to our vision of Europe that employers and workers should , as far as possible , decide on their own terms and conditions and working hours , and not have governments or the EU decide for them . #% I stood here nearly a year ago to comment on the tenth anniversary of the European Court of Auditors ' refusal to sign off the EU accounts . #% That is the last thing we want to achieve because , in many areas , I suspect this is an agricultural policy not an industrial policy , and , of course , we must not underestimate the importance of genetic modification in meeting the biofuels targets that we require . #% It says it is investigating , but I want a full investigation . #% This is about a fundamental freedom , with the focus on abortion , a highly emotive subject . #% I was given a lot of documents by the Commission . #% The ALDE Group is totally supportive of these reports and we want more openness . #% I am glad he was still able to remember the crucial arguments underpinning his report a whole year after he steered it through the committee . #% Species have dropped by 80 to 90 % . #% This would cover the Sangatte Centre near Calais . #% At this point , I should also mention the impact of the WTO Doha Development Round on an EU-India FTA . #% That too is not a threat . #% So I hope that this Parliament will hold governments like Britain 's to their promises on sex equality , on free speech and on avoiding the imposition of Sharia law in Iraq and Afghanistan . #% They cover areas such as textiles , which is a particularly big area . #% Any civilised society is judged not by how it treats its majority but how it treats its minorities . #% In fact , in all too many cases , environmental laws are ignored , targets are not met , reports are not sent in to the Commission on time and those countries which break the law go unpunished . #% We need to work with the United States to make that a reality . #% We want to see the return of refugees and we want to see free and fair elections . #% But here , at the European level , we can do more . #% Sixthly , is it true that the six opposition candidates were arrested after the election and one of these , Mr Yorongar , was beaten and wounded ? #% As we all know , there are many competing claims - the claims of ACP banana producers , Community banana producers , EU businesses which have been hit hard by US sanctions , the EU 's role and standing in the WTO and , of course , the rights and interests of European banana consumers . #% It promotes mobility , and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded . #% Can we not see that by continuing to talk about the Lisbon Strategy , the European Union is emphasising its own impotence ? #% Young farmers need greater access to production rights . #% I hope this House will act swiftly when this matter comes before it at the next plenary session . #% The electors I represent will not thank us . #% It is very important to define the general procedures for interoperability and it is with some regret that we lost those in the CII Directive . #% At the outset I would like to thank the other 26 Members of the European Parliament on the delegation for their work , particularly my deputy chairman , Mrs Napoletano , and , of course Mrs de Keyser , in her capacity as chief observer of the European Union 's team . #% What is Kennedy remembered for ? #% Only in this way will the European Parliament perform its task of independent custodian of the independent bank as set out in the exemplary and pioneering report so finely chased and chiselled by my colleague Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath . #% It admits that people tend to see the Community legal framework as being excessively complex and unclear and proposes that it be simplified and rationalised . #% Prosperity comes from a secure workforce and a society that invests in all its citizens , excluding no-one . #% As a result of that , the committee meetings are constantly under pressure and those codecision committees are now unable to legislate effectively . #% Was the decision the subject of unanimous agreement in the Joint Committee ? #% Even before the crisis begins , women and other groups experience the different food entitlements which are common in many societies . #% We do not know what companies might be interested but are deterred from starting up such companies , again because of flaws in the legislation . #% That is genuinely very important for youth employment opportunities . #% We want to see true partnership at work and the real benefits that this can bring to the European Union . #% The report by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna contains a reference to the duty of the country under whose flag a vessel is flying to exercise jurisdiction and take action if that vessel infringes the regulations . #% I know that my colleague , Mr Medina Ortega , is concerned about the way that self - and co-regulation develops , but I would argue that , if we consider that as a genuine alternative at the beginning of the process and see how it is integrated and that safeguards are built in and check it against the alternative of heavyweight and intrusive legislation , this can only be to the benefit of simplifying and improving the regulatory climate . #% It truly has to be risk-sensitive compliance . #% We in the European Union have been hugely successful in the way that we have offered the benefits of our own networking technology through spreading the Géant Network to the developing world and also encouraging the development of open competitive markets to deliver high-quality services at competitive cost . #% We know that there will be new intergovernmental negotiations to reform the treaties on these points . #% We are working at Peugeot at the moment and in other areas . #% Similarly , we hope for continuing availability of innovative measures as currently allowed under Article 6 . #% I urge everybody to support this . #% At a point when we are finishing the technical work of economic and monetary union , citizens in the EU simply do not understand the whole process . #% I do not think it does , but that would therefore make it 1.03 % at best . #% Sometimes in the debate I have got the feeling that the European Union is the only body that is being defrauded . #% Turning to Mr Désir 's report , we could not agree more with him when he names the transnational corporations as a source of negative effects on the environment and on our social standards . #% We want to listen to citizens . #% But there are a number of Member States which use filtered honey extensively to remove insect debris , grains of sand and pollen fragments . #% The important and welcome news that we have had today about the appointment of a new Secretary-General , Mr David O ' Sullivan , raises the question whether he has been involved already and will that have an impact on the development that you have already set in train . #% Finally , I would like to join my southern colleague Mr Booth and speak up for the Isles of Scilly helicopter service . #% None of these businesses can hope to deal with the complexities of this regulation , the paperwork , the recordings and the inspections - and they will progressively be driven out of the feed industry . #% I hope that both Council and Commission will hear very strongly the strength of feeling which is shared by all groups in the European Parliament on this subject and seek to get the best possible deal in September . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his work in bringing this report before Parliament . #% 
We needed guarantees of transparency , openness and consultation . #% Thus , while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend , we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed . #% Unfortunately there is not yet a scintilla of evidence that the EU is currently equipped to take on such a role . #% After all , it is Mr Mugabe and his ZANU-PF cronies who have systematically pillaged and brutalised the once prosperous country of Zimbabwe , brought lawlessness and starvation on its people and forced so many of them to live in fear and desperation . #% Elections are due there in the autumn and I think it is the clause in this urgency that deals with those parliamentary elections that is the most critical . #% Mr President , could I thank the honourable Members in all parts of the House for the constructive contributions they have made in the course of this debate . #% Clearly , there is no point in having a statement on Kosovo and a debate several hours later when the Council , I understand , will not be here . #% The policy of critical dialogue has not succeeded in bringing about a change in the Iranian Government 's policy despite all the talk of the moderation of Rafsanjani and the mellowing of the regime . #% . Mr President , we are all familiar with the principle of substitution , the substitution of a more environmentally friendly or more healthy product for another one which is environmentally damaging or damaging to health . #% For example , they are now forbidden to talk to the press and to make statements . #% It is at last time to say goodbye to Commissioner Patten , but I look forward to working with him in the quest for a ` yes ' vote on the Constitution in Britain . #% They have all the files , all the information , and you will be agreeably surprised . #% Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment . #% I congratulate Mr Deprez on an intelligent and reasoned approach , with measures that facilitate freedom of movement for third-country nationals on Member State territories for a maximum period of three months . #% Mr Pirker also said that the purpose was to ensure that there are no social abuses of the system . #% All of this adds up to the possibility of job creation and business start-ups which do not have to be subsidized , which leads me to say that if I were to find fault with any part of Mrs Sierra González ' report it would be where it suggests any intervention in the pricing and the market mechanism of the information society , or where it suggests additional spending in the European budget beyond existing lines for structural funds and the cohesion fund . #% I also welcome Amendment 7 to encourage companies to better anticipate economic , technical and industrial change . #% First , in relation to recital D and paragraph 24 , we should recognise that there are a range of electoral systems used in the different European countries , and in fact around one-quarter of current MPs in Turkey are from Kurdish origin . #% It is certainly a very impressive report and it is one which the Socialists will be happy to support for the most part . #% It is not about colonial powers . #% Equal access to the public service sector and the labour market and freedom from discrimination are essential for all people regardless of race , ethnicity , or heritage . #% But you need to tell industry now across the whole of Europe that we are going to reward best practice and it should start investing now in making a difference to our planet . #% The committee has been disappointed at the perceived inability to control the budget for the body in question , although I accept that it was only introduced this year . #% I believe that you are all looking for new uses to justify the huge cost of the Galileo satellite project . #% Article 121 will be invoked with all of those . #% Recently a German Council official told me that his Brussels office might as well be in Bonn , as his main point of reference was the German Foreign Ministry . #% Clearly the reforms - and I know you will be able to tell us much more about them in a moment - are at a critical stage . #% These schools then subsidised free education for the non-working poor . #% We are all Europeans and decisions made in this House are made in the interest of Europe as a whole - this is not an intergovernmental institution . #% As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said , we have to be realistic in our approach to , and modern in our interpretation of , relationships and to show understanding for the circumstances that people find themselves in nowadays . #% We are not looking for confrontation , we are actually looking for a way of cooperating together . #% Madam President , firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very courageous report . #% I stupidly asked him `` Do you feel you are beating it yet ? '' and he said to me `` I have a lifetime struggle ahead of me - if I ever think that I have beaten it , then I am lost '' . #% The alternative is to contain Saddam for a while until the world 's attention is focused elsewhere and he can once again rearm . #% Therefore , whilst I recognise that I looked at the British consequences , I am extremely concerned about the effects on those jobs across Europe . #% The Commission can help , as I hope they will , by speeding up the inter-service consultation which still seems to be a rather dozy process . #% If we do that , we may be able to introduce a degree of sense and coherence into our Rules which is currently missing and will remain missing to our detriment if we do not manage to do it . #% I would be particularly interested if you could give me the name of the hospital privately , without making any fuss about it , and I would be glad to see whether they were in fact on the list of contacts , because they should be . #% In the United Kingdom there has been chaos on our railways , there has been plummeting customer confidence in the rail system , remedial work has caused huge financial investment and Railtrack has threatened a delay in work on the Euro Channel Tunnel Phase II programme which is very much part of the integrated European rail system that we all support . #% Mr President , I am glad that the rapporteur has consulted the stakeholders on this matter , although I note he does not specify who they are ! #% I am not seeking to apportion blame in any way , but if we wish to see the farming industry - particularly the beef industry - flourish in Europe , we must all shoulder the responsibility to enforce the rules . #% The 48-hour week , rigidly enforced , will cause small firms to close or drive people into the black economy , where they are outside of all protection and where they will become avoiders of income tax and VAT . #% I am afraid to say , Commissioner , that the Commission is at the root of this confusion . #% For us the pyres were not on the television screen , they were over the garden fence . #% Then there were two papers which the Commission itself produced to justify the expenditure for computerization to try to overcome this crisis in the system . #% It has also stated its intention to extend its power to create further criminal offences . #% Of colleagues here in the Chamber , the pioneers of the Euro-Mediterranean policy are very numerous on the left , but not so numerous on the centre-right , with the distinguished exceptions of Mr Busuttil , Mr Kasoulides and Mrs Saïfi , but more may come . #% Instead I believe we should all work together to bring down trade barriers that condemn the poor . #% I also wish to draw attention to the part of the report that states , and I quote directly : ' Growth [ in the pharmaceutical industry ] can not be a political aim in itself since there is no direct relationship between the consumption of pharmaceuticals and the health of the public . ' #% At the same time , if we are going to create an operational role for Europol , we must ensure there are proper mechanisms in place for democratic accountability and for people to make justified complaints where they feel there has been unfairness . #% I wonder whether during the next plenary part-session arrangements could be made for those Members who would like to have a preview of the building , to be able to do so ? #% On reflection , I have to say that if we had left out the words ` political signature ' in our discharge report we may not have scared the Council as much as we did . #% Mr De Luca is quite right in claiming that the result of this enquiry has brought the Commission and Parliament 's Budgetary Control Committee closer together in addressing the various problems . #% That has not been addressed . #% We are not able to scrutinize the executive and blow the whistle . #% Until the dumping of all subsidised crops and products onto their markets is ended , they will continue to face an uphill struggle to lift themselves out of crippling poverty . #% Many of us in the European Union are very grateful for the work of the Canadians , Banting and Best , in discovering insulin some 75 years ago . #% Clarification of the responsibilities between Ecofin and the Central Bank is required sooner rather than later . #% In your presentation , Commissioner , you mentioned the danger of one company gaining control over these markets . #% We have seen plenty of examples of that in the past . #% The other provisions of the directive relating to daily and weekly rest breaks , annual leave and nightwork will , of course , apply to junior doctors after a three-year transposition period just as they do for all other workers . #% I was very pleased to hear the upbeat assessment of the informal summit by both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council . #% Humanitarian and reconstruction aid must be given and used with transparency and accountability , and debt systems reformed . #% The obligation to give the same price to everyone will make internalisation uneconomic . #% I have carefully studied the budget for 2007-2013 , totalling EUR 336 billion , which I call Plan A , and I see that EUR 139 billion of the total is being allocated to eight of the latest new Members and another EUR 22 billion to Bulgaria and Romania , with a meagre EUR 12 billion allocated to Britain during that period . #% However , I want to concentrate on the fact that the proposal `` requires '' Member States to implement in their national law the provisions relating to an improved compensation procedure . #% 
Almost one person every minute is killed by the bullet from a gun and two million children have been killed in the last decade . #% Ministers and the Commission must have a common understanding of how the Pact should be applied . #% It is the terrorists and their apologists that are the biggest abusers of the human rights of our citizens . #% Any country not managing that should not be surprised if they find their staff moving elsewhere , to countries which have managed to implement more modern working conditions . #% The helicopter shuttle to the Isles of Scilly provides an essential public service and is the mainstay of the islands ' economy . #% We should stick to the term of office of the next Commission , which is five years . #% The Council used to deliberate all the time behind closed doors , with no right of public access to documents , and did not even publish the results of its votes , thereby making it impossible for national parliaments to see how the ministers representing their country voted . #% Is that true ? #% He was not just a statistic ; he was a health professional who was serving 15 life sentences for the murder of 215 of his patients . #% Belgians and French people would then be able to enjoy British chocolate as much as the British have enjoyed French and Belgian chocolate . #% With Aristide came a beacon of hope , which was snuffed out by a military coup , reinstated , but then the country steadily lapsed into a regime of economic decline , human rights abuses , murderous militias and dubious electoral practices . #% Therefore , on the question of how we are to handle enlargement , the majority of my Group would be in favour of consolidation of the Union rather than continuing enlargement simply because countries feel that they meet the criteria . #% This mechanism is not a charm that we can put on the wall to ward off market discipline . #% That being the case , why not say so ? #% I have seen far too many NAOs drowning under tenders and contracts . #% They include those on waste incineration , allowing small-farm incinerators to continue ; on allowing burial on farm in remote areas ; on the exemption of manure produced on farms ; on the uses of meat and bone meal as fertilizers , given the safeguards that exist ; also , on the alternatives to rendering , such as alkaline hydrolysis . #% You say that they had EUR 40 million between 18 countries . #% As my report clearly states , Bulgaria is part of the current inclusive and irreversible enlargement process that is based on the own merits principle . #% Clearly , whatever system we develop must be voluntary , in the sense that companies should be able to choose whether or not to become involved . #% The approach of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection is also very balanced . #% This is the sweeping rhetoric that occupies the high ground but the detail of the debate today occupies the low ground . #% Subsidiarity under Article 3B of the Treaty on European Union remains the legal basis for returning powers from the EU to the Member States whenever possible . #% Therefore they were able to access medical care , there was a school for their children , and the Fair Trade premium meant that there was investment in water in their local villages . #% I believe , as do Amnesty , Human Rights Watch and the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan , that the government has taken a wrong turn and that the position of women is worse than it was before . #% I am very pleased that the common position has been changed and we now have a compromise . #% Thirdly , the ECB should discuss on a regular basis developments in each of the Member States of the euro area in order to have a positive influence on price and wage developments which must , as Mr Duisenberg rightly pointed out , differ from Member State to Member State . #% Other towns and cities in the UK are pursuing similar initiatives . #% In the interests of accuracy : Mr Helmer has no understanding of politics , of statistics , of literature , of courtesy towards a fellow Member State of the European Union - and I could go on for a considerable amount of time . #% Madam President , as North Korean dictator , Kim Jong-Il sips his specially imported French brandy and savours his freshly cooked pizzas cooked by two Italian chefs , as he mulls over what he will say to the UN envoy , many thousands of his oppressed subjects , including babies , are literally starving to death as his disastrous Stalinist economic policies have brought the country to its knees . #% The European Parliament is an important body . #% The figures do not look very significant , but they represent millions of tonnes of material which must be collected , recycled and new markets found . #% Mr President , I speak on behalf of my colleague Mr Van Orden , who is absent today but who for many years has been directly involved in the work of overcoming the scourge of anti-personnel landmines . #% I simply wanted to thank the presidency but also the sessional services for all the work they do to ensure that this process goes through so smoothly . #% Mr President , I too welcome the movement at long last on these dossiers and the work of the rapporteurs involved , and of those who have worked hard to put forward their opinions . #% Euro funds have already made a lasting improvement to the lives of the people of the North-West . #% Movements of animals for other purposes -- such as bringing on , breeding or restocking -- may genuinely require longer journey times . #% This is being used by sophisticated organised criminals and is therefore something that , I hope , he will be taking a serious interest in . #% In this House we have very strict rules that we must have original signatures for amendments to be tabled , but a whole bunch of my colleagues were held up in transit yesterday , did not arrive until after 19.00 and were therefore unable to sign amendments that had been circulated by the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform , amongst others . #% Finally , concerning paragraph 54 of the Naïr report , could the Commissioner also confirm that the two Mediterranean candidate countries might be able to participate in the Euromed Heritage programme . #% It is precisely to do that and to harmonize the testing procedures that the working group is sitting to deal with the matter . #% We had refused to talk to Mr Haniyeh and , not surprisingly , having undermined the democratic forces , the forces of violence took over . #% Yes , we could take action to control large-point sources - and we did . #% The opposition is these people here ! #% Mrs Hautala and others will know of my ambitions in this respect . #% It has been a bad story for some time and it is particularly embarrassing if you are Belgian , of course , or indeed anybody visiting Brussels , because the city of Brussels is one of the cities which has been in breach of this directive for the longest period . #% He will be aware of the status of the President-in-Office . #% Emphasizing my support for the wild bird directive , it is important to say that angling is the biggest participation sport in Britain and , I assume , in Europe , and it is important to show that we listen to the points made to us by anglers . #% As coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I particularly would like to commend Mrs McCarthy on the excellent work she has done , as well as our committee , which held a hearing on this topic . #% The report overall is stronger at stating actions rather than evaluating their effectiveness and I hope we will see greater use of human rights impact assessments in future years . #% Sadly , many MEPs see culture purely as a tool for promoting European integration and pursuing a delusional project called ` a United States of Europe ' . #% Her remarks fit this depressing tradition perfectly . #% I hope , for example , that Europol would not be expected to cooperate in a raid such as that on MED TV , which I raised earlier on . #% Our target was 2010 - not ' 2010 and beyond ' - but we are nowhere near reaching our target of halting biodiversity loss by that year , which is not so far away . #% Otherwise you will have trash television seeping back like the backflow in a sewage system to affect the cinema industry as well . #% The e-commerce directive past last year was designed to encourage cross-border trade by enshrining the country-of-origin principle . #% What does it take before the world responds to this catastrophe ? #% When the European Parliament , that so frequently insists on workers ' rights and proper social protection , is building a hemicycle , it should make sure that the contracts concerning those employed in the buildings should provide for full social protection and full payment . #% Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information . #% The difficulties manifest themselves today in Europe in the pressure for people from less developed countries wanting to migrate to Europe , and in people fleeing from some of the countries that are so desperate not just because of their economic situation , but also their lack of democracy and violence , and seeking asylum in the west . #% These include areas where the EU has adopted human rights guidelines such as on the death penalty , torture , human rights defenders and the rights of children , including their involvement in armed conflict , as well as on other issues , ranging from human rights and terrorism to democracy and elections and the International Criminal Court . #% Mr Maat made the point that it is no good the Commission coming up with a proposal before it has taken note of what the North Sea Advisory Council has said . #% Mr President , it is a real pleasure to hear Mrs Winberg and the Commissioner speaking with one voice on an issue which should concern us all . #% I hope Parliament is not calling on the Queen to abdicate , so that maybe we can elect President Kinnock in her place ! #% Tunisia has in recent years faced a hostile , fundamentalist , Islamic opposition inspired by Salafist and Wahhabi teachings and committed to the violent overthrow of its government . #% Thirdly , the evidence now emerging in Cumbria suggests that the public health consequences of the outbreak are much wider-ranging and much longer-lasting than was supposed at the time . #% The universal service definition which the Commission has come up with is a good start , but it is not the end of the story . #% 
Many of us in this House believe that , in completing the process of Economic and Monetary Union , it is now very much the job of the European Union to turn its attention to economic reform . #% We have the privilege today of having this debate on the single currency . #% I wish he were on a performance-related pay and he might find that the fat cheque might not look nearly so attractive . #% Mr President , as a British citizen I strongly oppose the budget settlement that Mr Tony Blair purports to suggest that he negotiated in December . #% Mr President , this report was voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure , which allows for no debate and no amendment to the report . #% Mr President , this amendment to the directive is part of the process of tidying up the loose ends not covered by the Auto/Oil Programme . #% We are moving towards a document which will carry to the Council many of the points that we have raised and will be a sound basis for further work in the next Parliament . #% Remember the fears about all the impact assessments and the wild figures about how much REACH was going to cost and the risk that this would lead to the European chemical industry disappearing from the shores of this continent and relocating in China . #% Possibly also , through war in the north of Iraq , we are discovering its links with the Al Qaida network of international terrorists . #% O'Neil attests to this ; experts from the British Ministry of Agriculture produced a report showing that British waters were literally teeming with fish , whilst there were very few within the fishing limits of the present Community countries . #% The hardest test on human rights for any nation is when we stand accused of human rights abuse . #% I introduced Amendment No 45 to make sure that there was a six-year period for implementation , running from 1997 to 2003 , thereby overlapping the strained and difficult period which will be covered by the early years of this directive . #% What we did propose - and what may be negotiated with the Council - was to use existing humanitarian aid reserves and to find wording , without changing the legislation , to make sure we can use them for the problems we find ourselves with in category 4 . #% Yes , e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs . #% But notwithstanding our political differences with that country , we are still committed in areas of mutual interest such as the management of illegal immigration and cross-border crime . #% My action on Monday was one further small step in trying to achieve that . #% That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform . #% In this report , Parliament is calling for greater transparency and the Commission needs to do far more to strengthen the link between its legislative work programme and the budget procedure . #% The choice of method of worker involvement is flexible and respects national cultures and traditions . #% Finally , I would just like to say that the rapporteur 's amendments calling for greater self-evaluation and participation of stakeholders inserts a valuable cog in the evaluation machine . #% Mr President , Parliament today will vote on its fifth resolution on Zimbabwe in the last 18 months . #% The fact is that the Balkan countries have just left one bossy , bureaucratic , corrupt organisation called Yugoslavia , and do not wish to join an organisation with similar characteristics merely for the benefit of their health . #% There are many irregularities in the Swedish case against him . #% If this is passed , it will provide us with an opportunity for further thought and reflection at the codecision stage . #% Still less would it be possible to fix a rate which would also suit the persistently divergent economy of the UK . #% I believe that it should not be for us in this Parliament to decide and to dictate excessive and rigid restrictions on how people choose to spend their lives . #% It seems rather strange , that as we move to the single currency with the possibility of smart cards and electronic money and so forth , that we are proposing the rather backward step of having eight separate coins in circulation . #% In due course , we may need to look at its costs to see if we are adequately funding it , but for now it is certainly not costly . #% It is what they say that matters . #% Therefore , the very medicines we are discussing are excluded from the list in question . #% Mr President , I should just like to make a point about linguistics , something that colleagues will be interested in . #% The Environmental Advisory Board includes amongst its members a member of the Green Alliance and the chairman of one of the EU Scientific Advisory Committees . #% Mr President , I was deeply disappointed that the initiative to launch a parliamentary committee of inquiry into the allegations of misuse of EU funds by the Palestinian Authority was not even discussed at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents last Thursday . #% It is important in the weeks up to the second round that as much is done as possible to tighten up on any procedural weaknesses , so that there can be no technical grounds for dispute at what will be a very sensitive moment . #% We know that this must be material sympathy and support , as well as mere moral support . #% Aid carries with it the poison pill of conditionality that forces the opening of the markets to privatisation of state assets , and the straitjacket of monetarist policies . #% Different views are represented in this House , whether it be on agriculture , structural funds or whatever . #% Now , however , late in the day , it is talking about a number of regulations of a domestic nature , in relation to our social security and other systems , that will have a discriminatory effect here . #% To date , it remains the youngest member of the United Nations , as from 2002 . #% Personally , I remain optimistic for what is essentially a very good news story in the western Balkans . #% I could not understand why it was felt necessary to do that . #% But , as a democrat , I have to say no and that is why we will be voting no tomorrow . #% It is vital that all industries play their part , including the aviation industry . #% When a lorry fills your rear-view mirror , are you going to wonder whether that driver is employed and rested , or self-employed and potentially tired and dangerous ? #% That arrangement has governed previous European Union contributions under the successive conventions and has been repeatedly praised by the United Nations Agency because it prevents erosion in the value of the Community ' s contribution . #% We must continue our clear commitment to Romania , Bulgaria and Turkey to ensure that the enlargement process proceeds . #% First of all there has to be an urgent public investigation : that is absolutely necessary . #% They waved banners in this hall when we took our vote ; they tried to disrupt the official launch of the European Parliament 's information campaign ; they have made the claim that it is somehow illegitimate for this Parliament to present its view and its conclusion to the outside world . #% But if he is correct in saying that the two parties are only two days away from a possible agreement , it is absolutely inexplicable that he should be giving one of the parties two weeks in order to resolve this matter . #% It should not , in my opinion , be allowed to stand as a proper instrument for the opening of the first phase of consultation between the social partners under the procedure included in Article 138 . #% Is it the case that the Council still attaches importance to the democratic interplay between the three institutions and that closer cooperation will not inevitably mean greater decision making by one institution , by the Council , to the detriment of Parliament and Commission and , by implication , the people of Europe ? #% There must be rigorous notification and justification procedures and I hope that the British Government , and other Member State governments who feel that they can delay further by seeking two years and then another will feel so embarrassed that they will not seek to do so and meet the goal in nine years . #% I ask that it be corrected and that my vote on Amendment No 2 of the Desama report be changed from ` Against ' to ` In favour ' . #% But what Indonesia most needs is our support for their efforts to find and fund solutions and any criticism from us must be constructive . #% The wish is expressed to set up the European Food Safety Agency and get it operational . #% I am left with a sense of unease and residual doubt when respected organisations have made allegations , but we can not honestly say they have been thoroughly investigated . #% On a personal note , I am most grateful for Mrs Berès ' moral support . #% We are pleased that in future we are going to be monitoring policies in terms of a social sustainable development emphasis . #% If those countries want to sell on the lucrative EU markets , we should encourage them to adopt decent and sustainable standards at home . #% I am concerned that the emphasis in his answer was on definitions , about reporting , about statistics - i.e. analysis - rather than the tougher decisions that are equally required to shift resources . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I wonder if I might perhaps offer a few words of wisdom here . #% What is your response to that ? #% Why then does Parliament object to the comitology system ? #% We have big issues to deal with , from a policy on immigration , to combating racism and xenophobia , to ending the huge injustice of 20 million European residents having no right of movement , because they are third-country nationals . #% That is the point I believe the Quaestors will be urging on the Bureau in the near future . #% The only way in which we can actually ensure the proper maintenance of an international convention which has the effect of law is to demand on all occasions that the procedures required under the law are fulfilled properly in a balanced but a completely full way . #% 
The new text has been substantially restructured and clarified which is important for effective transposal in Member States . #% It is well known that a vast array of chemicals are used in cotton-production and we therefore support the Commission 's aim for Member States to determine and adopt the appropriate environmental measures to regulate the use of agricultural land used to produce cotton . #% Services of general interest are also crucial as a means of social cohesion and therefore we welcome the recommendation in this report on the need for a framework directive in this area . #% There is a very real risk of this triggering an even greater loss of faith by South Africa in the EU . #% I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for their good work and collaboration . #% Lastly , I call for more condemnation by Muslim leaders of terrorism and the rejection of extremism within their communities . #% Well , that is actually rather unfair because the British are still paying GBP 30 million a day into an organisation whose accounts have not been signed off for the last 11 years in a row , and we are paying our fair share of the new underground system in Warsaw , and the sewers in Budapest , and goodness knows how many hectares of French farmland . #% It would be interesting to hear what principles they think the European Union should be founded on , if they object to this basic set of principles . #% Simply calling it a development round without genuinely addressing the demands of developing countries is a sleight of hand that fails to address their real concerns . #% I would add reflection - we ought to reflect before every experiment is carried out . #% We can either impose sanctions on countries that do not meet standards or we can engage in ongoing dialogue to ensure that conditions in these countries are improved , and understand that Rome was not built in a day and neither were Europe 's superior high standards . #% I can not see him stopping the traffic in Beijing or Washington ; I doubt anybody in Brussels would even recognise who he is . #% In the Commission , systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred . #% The emphasis on maintaining the EU 's territorial integrity and an economic security clause designed to secure the EU 's communications and supplies implies a defence capability for the European Union . #% It was never part of the Cotonou Agreement that the proposal for alternatives to EPAs would be delayed to 2004 and I hope he will withdraw that point when the debate is closed . #% He has produced a product , which I use myself , called Armilatox which is the only effective way of treating plant diseases like Honey Fungus . #% Assuming we vote for deletion , I would ask the Commission to take note that we shall not be moved on this issue . #% Nevertheless , my group , the ECR , regards it as a personal conscience matter whether the death sentence is justifiable in the most serious crimes of terrorism and murder . #% It is time that in Britain and in many other countries of Europe we heard what the people have to say . #% It will be clear to the House that unlike homosexual couples in all Member States other than the Netherlands , cohabiting heterosexual partners who are not married to other people could , if they so wish , get married . #% It is a growth and stability pact , requiring a proper policy mix of fiscal and monetary instruments to enhance the job-generating powers of EMU . #% From what I hear , everyone speaking on this side of the Channel has an entirely different perspective . #% To be honest , I do not grasp this peculiar split between evaluation of ` putting into effect ' measures necessary to join Schengen which , according to the Commission , has to remain intergovernmental , and checking the ` implementation ' of the Schengen acquis . #% Therefore , we must have a constitutional treaty . #% Human rights are universal and indivisible : the EU is committed to upholding these rights . #% Creating competitiveness requires a much more prosaic approach . #% The proposals for training on a healthy diet have already attracted widespread ridicule in the British press . #% I also commend the attempt to move towards a policy of achieving maximum sustainable yields . #% There is very little to be said for the counterfeiter except that , at best , he or she is a parasite upon productive industry . #% I have always believed that the great benefit of enlargement of EU to the east is to anchor these countries in a climate of peace , prosperity and an institutional respect for democracy and fundamental human rights . #% Secondly , regarding enhanced GSP that will , hopefully , provide an incentive for improved social and environmental performance , could you say how successful the existing scheme has been , and whether you think a doubling is going to be enough ? #% The Silhouette case was not the last word on all this and nor , as he would acknowledge , is Mr Mayer 's report . #% We would be better off without it . #% The procedure agreed by the Iranian Guardian Council for the screening of election candidates does not meet those standards . #% In our opinion the Council 's position does not go far enough in placing restrictions on state aid for some key elements . #% You , Mr Duisenberg , have raised objections in the past to such a move , because the Governing Council tends to decide by consensus . #% Madam President , your services were informed yesterday that we would not sign this compromise amendment . #% Well , as we know , we are 75 % of the way through and the thing has crashed in ruins . #% We need these countries to work with us to deal with the problem of people trafficking -- the 21st century version of slavery . #% This small investment will pay off extremely handsomely in terms of two-way cooperation and understanding , and I would urge that the majority of only one vote in committee should be overturned by a successful vote in plenary . #% Once again this morning , the rapporteur has shown confusion between the notions of driving time and working time . #% Since 1999 he has been president for life . #% I say ` Mickey Mouse bank ' , Mr Maystadt , because all I have heard from you so far is how you are going to invest money to change the weather . #% It is absolutely right that at this stage we get our procedures into line to make sure we can take full advantage of that . #% We are interested of course in their security of work conditions , but we are interested in promoting their mobility . #% I agree with the rapporteur that this money and this programme will ensure that the efforts are targeted not just at some small sections of society but , as the Commissioner said in a previous report , at all sections of society . #% This resolution mandates the European parliamentary delegation inside the Convention . #% Secondly , given that the Commission proposes to do this before making proposals which then go before the Council and Parliament , how does it envisage following the amendments being made by the Council and Parliament to ensure that there is an impact assessment of those amendments ? #% If you look at rail freight in Europe , for example , the drop in traffic is quite alarming . #% It is not just individual citizens who fear poor guarantees of rights ; this also deters judges , but also police and prosecutors , from working together , too . #% Moreover , local officials also oppressed in particular the Montagnard , or hill tribe people . #% -- Mr President , the meeting of the Council later this month will provide an opportunity for Member State governments to affirm the vital need for reform to proceed more rapidly than it has before . #% I am therefore sad to see that there are some Members on the far right of this House , and a few British Conservatives -- going against the view of the Group that they profess to belong to -- -- who are challenging the legislation in the Court of Justice . #% The first is a plea from an individual parliamentarian that we should make sure that we have a date firmly fixed for the second network computer in our offices . #% I think we had some very interesting debates and we did not always agree . #% We believe that the amendments which look at the need to respect the codes of conduct laid down by professional services again are now well chosen and have taken account of the debate on second reading . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to thank Mr Byrne for his statement and all those involved in drawing up this report . #% We insert human rights clauses in external agreements . #% Today , we hear them claiming that the result of the referendum in Spain was somehow illegitimate . #% Their vote will determine whether we meet in Brussels or in Strasbourg on that particular day . #% I understand too that Commissioner Almunia , responding to today 's debate , will pledge that his colleague Mr Michel will this weekend press Alan Johnston 's case with President Abbas and representatives of the Palestinian Authority . #% The purpose of the letter signed by the official mentioned in the honourable Member 's question was to signify his full awareness that these requirements always prevail and are unconditional . #% I concur with what has been said about waste and the need for recycling and energy saving and I believe that we must practice what we preach both in the area of health and safety and energy saving . #% Mr President , we know that one reason for military intervention is the search for weapons of mass destruction , but there are , of course , other reasons . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Paulsen for all the work she has done to come to this complex compromise . #% The EU is now determined to go it alone , but the biggest culprit , the US , with 4 % of the world ' s population and 25 % of global emissions , still will not co-operate . #% 
I welcome the fact that you will be monitoring whether the ruling is properly applied . #% Sadly , there are many other examples of gold plating in the fields of business and industry . #% Therefore I fundamentally respect and want to endorse that democratic procedure . #% That I should even have to make such a statement here in Parliament makes this a day of great sadness . #% We , in this House , having debated economic and monetary union for many years now , should not underestimate the level of public feeling , not only in countries like the United Kingdom but in other countries around the European Union . #% However , I fear we are also opening up a nightmare of duality in the appeal , on the one hand , the European Court of Human Rights and , on the other , the European Court of Justice . #% Similarly , I can agree with the rapporteur that pre-trade , post-trade transparency needs improvement , and particularly that post-trade data for non-equity products are provided in a form which is readily consolidated . #% Now that the rural development programme is in place it is important to examine how this programme can be used to strengthen training and re-training facilities in our agricultural colleges . #% I would like to ask Commissioner Byrne how he is going to stop this problem arising . #% The report highlights the lack of genuine democracy in Azad Kashmir and , in particular , for the first time , the plight of the inhabitants of Gilgit-Baltistan . #% Of course operators such as Isle of Wight ferries may have been forced to consider their economic liability because of such opportunist press releases . #% On security policy , I welcome the progress being made but let us ensure that we focus on capability rather than institutional structures because we will only be judged by how capable we are . #% However , we welcome calls for restraint and de-escalation between India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir and note encouraging signs that President Musharraf has finally heeded calls to reign in Islamic terrorists which his regime has until very recently supported , terrorists who have recently committed atrocities against Jamu and Kashmiri civilians and even the Indian parliament . #% Mr President , I should like to say a few words on the Ludford report on the rights of long-term residents . #% I welcome this action plan . #% Mr President , the shortage of bras in our department stores has indeed proved to be a beneficial crisis because it has exposed the EU for exactly what it is : a backward-looking customs union , an anachronism in the 21st century , and a bloated bureaucracy that failed to spot the obvious happening , while the Commissioner was enjoying a lengthy holiday . #% We assume this will also include environmental factors , given that we know that the poorest people often live in the poorest and most degraded environments and housing , with the effects that has on mental health . #% It will not come all at once , it will come in waves of countries determined by geopolitics , by economic and political readiness and , only marginally , by economics . #% Mr President , Commissioner , in speaking previously to this House I have pointed out that there is a tension in the proposed regulation between ensuring traceability for public health purposes and providing useful consumer information . #% Perhaps we need an import levy from non-EC countries to ensure that we protect our own market . #% Mr President , it is rather strange that everybody is emphasizing what good developmental aspects these reports have for the fishing industry of Guinea , in this case , and for other countries as well . #% The Commission sensibly suggested looking at ways of allowing legal routes for migration . #% We all know what happens then : the EU fleets rape the waters , putting locals out of business and destroying fish stocks for years to come . #% in writing . - I have decided together with my colleagues from the European Parliamentary Labour Party , to support the original Report , which offers the most satisfactory response to the hundreds of petitions submitted by European citizens , victims of the massive rush for urbanisation in Spain , overbuilding and coastal destruction . #% One question about the motion for a resolution before us : why are we even thinking about giving money to Gaza ? #% If we fail to grasp this essential point we shall destroy ourselves , disinherit our children and betray Europe and our own countries . #% As a permanent member of the UN Security Council , Russia exercises a potentially decisive influence on international affairs , from our relations with North Korea to its involvement in the UN quartet . #% The story goes on . #% We have tried to look at the positions of Parliament and at what had and what had not got a legal base ; we have looked at the wishes of the committee and at how the lines were being spent . #% Mr President , a former Labour prime minister said that a week is a long time in politics . #% If we did not get that , we would not release certain amounts of money and allow certain staffing levels . #% More generally , people like Mr Bushill-Matthews are constantly telling me that the opt-out is essential to give companies the flexibility they need to operate . #% I would join Mr Sturdy and others in saying that the response , particularly on the issue of import controls - certainly within the United Kingdom - is still too slow . #% Protecting the independence of the judiciary is of vital importance in a modern democratic society . #% Four years on , not a single patient has received a single drug . #% Mr President , first of all let me remind both the Council and Commission that the purpose of the regulation is : `` to give the fullest possible effect to the right of public access to documents and to lay down the general principles and limits on such access '' . #% But I look forward to seeing how we can address the issue of the increasing number of petitions that we have to deal with . #% It is not right that we should be expecting the Commission to do a whole range of things in putting their House and their budget in order unless we also take the same kinds of rigorous steps . #% It is clearly a very thorough conference . #% The core principles of the CFSP - promotion of democracy , human rights , the rule of law and fundamental freedoms - are absolutely crucial here . #% ( Murmurs ( of dissent ) ) we understand , will allow the National Executive Committee to make the rankings , the order of the list and the selections in toto , in secret and impose those candidates on the United Kingdom . #% Market access remains absolutely central as an issue . #% I emphasise that because sometimes when we talk about concepts like the internal market we forget that we are engaging people at the heart of what goes on and in our political work here . #% We want to see a directive which definitely commits the Member States to introduce environmental inspections operating on broadly similar lines . #% This effectively means they are asking Parliament to give them a blank cheque to determine what category of animal means after we have voted on whether or not to include it . #% While it is nice to recall the EU ' s important decision to grant duty-free access for essentially all products , it would have been even more significant to have gone beyond the famous `` essentially all '' to include those products of real importance to the poorest countries , such as agricultural goods . #% It is true that the use of sea transport and inland waterways is the most environmentally friendly way of moving goods with the possible exception of a locomotive using electricity produced in a nuclear power station . #% Egypt has contributed so much to our civilisation , we must urge it now to follow a civilised path on these issues . #% Can I say firstly that I was astonished by the Minister 's response to my honourable friend on the subject of human rights in Egypt . #% More than 18 months after the adoption of the Fourtou Report in December 2005 by an overwhelming majority of this House , we are still debating the same issues , and nothing has changed . #% Before us now is a measure requiring the paint industry to make changes in its production methods which will help ensure that these targets are met , at least with regard to the reduction in volatile organic compounds - one of the precursors of ozone pollution . #% We rightly call for Hamas to recognise Israel , yet stay silent while Israel flouts international laws . #% The precautionary principle is a separate subject and accordingly our Group can not support Amendments 1 or 2 . #% At present we estimate that some EUR 500 million will be needed in 2000 and EUR 500-700 million needed in 2001 and 2002 . #% We are looking to increase the amounts on each of these lines , largely because of enlargement . #% I am delighted to hear that he has accepted that . #% Finally , you talk about the onus being on Sweden to give the scientific evidence as to why it should be allowed to continue to ban the use of antibiotics in pig feed . #% In contrast , I can only praise the restraint and respect for the law shown by farmers in the north-west and Britain as a whole throughout this crisis . #% The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone . #% The report makes concrete and practical recommendations as to how public participation in this domain can be realised ; for example , information must be made available within a reasonable time-frame . #% Yet we have a frustration born out of the inability over the years of both railway companies and national governments to act in key areas . #% It needs to be explained in clear , cogent , simple prose so that it is comprehensible to people living in the world that exists outside the institutions . #% By failing to link the issue of congestion with air traffic reduction the report misses out on a vital strategy . #% I am told that they have created somewhere between 300 and 500 million contacts with European citizens every year . #% We can prepare the way for the euro and when and how it is introduced in the various Member States . #% One of the problems with the report is that it does not address the issue of falling employment in agriculture . #% 
That is an attempt to do two full-time jobs at once : it is no longer feasible , it is no longer tenable and it is right to phase it out . #% I recall that in a speech not long ago in this Parliament Commissioner Liikanen talked about some of the problems he is facing on potential pedestrian protection legislation for cars . #% Free trade also needs fair pricing in order for the producer and the seller to make due profit , as well as honest labelling of product origins and processes to satisfy the customers ' requirements on health and choice . #% Commissioner Byrne is to be congratulated on moving that closer . #% A similar future vision of a south-Asian economic community by 2025 will require free trade across the line of control . #% I also welcome the willingness of the Austrian Presidency to listen to the points made in our deliberations in preparing this resolution . #% I now come to the heart of the recommendations of Mrs. Díez González ' report . #% But it seems to me that what you are saying is that the Commission is not going to do anything to follow up its communication or its action plan . #% Where there has been a change in modern times is that now taxation is ` for the benefit of the taxed ' : that somehow we are being taxed pro bono . #% The only answer is to integrate the Bretton Woods agencies effectively in the UN system , to make them more directly accountable to all the nations of the world irrespective of ability to pay , to spread the principle of poverty reduction from the UN 's development programme into economic decision-making worldwide . #% In the last year in our community we have suffered the tragic death of teenager Leah Betts , after taking ecstasy pills in a Basildon nightclub . #% Some see it as a way of shutting down the possibilities of free movement unless people are seen not to be a ` burden on the state ' , in the language of the 1930s . #% You are very dangerous people indeed . #% It is up to Parliament in this report to push for the Treaty to be honoured and for the islands to be helped . #% This is not going to happen . #% Would it not be an appropriate message for this season of goodwill if she could at long last see her father who disappeared 15 years ago ? #% The annual cost of the TESTA programme , the part of IDA that deals with infrastructure , is EUR 4.6 million . #% Indeed , I believe there are now very few differences between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau , apart from maybe three or four issues . #% But as has already been pointed out , there have been no breaches of the law or of the regulator 's rules and guidelines . #% We do not . #% That means gearing up our ambitions for the removal of trade and regulatory barriers . #% I trust the British government will listen to the debate on this question in the Convention and then withdraw its dangerous and obscurantist proposal . #% If and when these relationships go wrong , and it is bound to happen from time to time , there is an overriding requirement for there to be in place proper legal processes to deal even-handedly and fairly with outstanding causes of disagreement . #% It is a question of whether it should be for the Commission and for the European Parliament to prescribe the fine detail of people ' s working and waking lives . #% We understand how far Kazakhstan has already travelled towards democracy and human rights . #% Nor was I , just now , seeking to prevent us discussing foot-and-mouth . #% We can not take action in every area of the world : we have to prioritise . #% To say that they can be covered is one way of trying to square the circle , but it is a contested interpretation to say the least . #% Perhaps the European Union could help them do just that . #% Of course assistance with restructuring can be given from within Member States . #% It is clear , however , that Bulgaria is a pro-European country , as the recent elections proved , and it is now up to Bulgaria 's decision-makers to continue their efforts and to follow their words with concrete and credible actions . #% We are also very keen to see the amendment tabled by Mr Bösch on the live export of animals adopted and I know that our rapporteurs are working actively to achieve that . #% It is up to the neighbouring countries of Africa and to the African Union to make sure that international standards of democracy pertain throughout Africa and throughout the country of Zimbabwe . #% This is a completely ludicrous argument which only a Belgian Member of the ALDE Group could possibly have come up with . #% That means appropriate health impact assessments , starting with the Commission 's own programmes , and proportionately more officials with the appropriate expertise , as identified in the excellent study carried out by Parliament 's services in support of our well-received public hearing last October . #% I am all for social dialogue , but this should be between employees and employers within their companies . #% When red tape is reduced and the safety of trial subjects is ensured , particularly through the involvement of ethics committees , EU citizens can benefit from exciting new drugs and discoveries and innovative medicinal products that result from efficiently conducted clinical trials carried out in a more timely manner than hitherto . #% I very much support the emphasis in the Commission 's proposal on country of origin , with a qualification that in many cases and in many areas the host country is suitable to deal with branches . #% Commissioner , you should join it as soon as possible and you should help build its political capacity . #% I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive , it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally , and are certainly very damaging economically . #% This Italian constitutional article has no place in modern Europe and is in clear breach of the freedom of movement provided for under the European treaties . #% I can not claim to be a close observer or to have very detailed knowledge of the operations of the agency and therefore I find her report very valuable . #% These are the positive aspects and need to be correctly framed in negotiations . #% It is certainly one of the most peaceful that I have known and my congratulations on the excellent work done by our two rapporteurs . #% It is ironic that this session will address seven individual country situations . #% However , I would commend the report to the House . #% It has been estimated that the cost of some of these barriers is actually higher than the existing tariff levels , and that most of the gains will come from removing these barriers . #% Today , we have half the Conservative delegation in this Chamber to hear his responses - and I have to say very few of my Socialist colleagues from the UK party . #% In that regard , I welcome some of the agreements recently undertaken between the ETF and the CER , particularly the issue of driving licences , as well as the commitment from the Commission to come forward with a proposal at the end of the year on that subject . #% We must recognise that our primary duty here today is to ensure the quality and safety of tissues and cells that are going to be used for the relief of human suffering , as they move around the single market to various destinations . #% The Minister referred to the United States of America : they have seen substantial steady increases in recent years in investment . #% I have always felt that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work . #% Ultimately , the polluter must pay . #% It is vitally important that their wish to join the European Union should be respected . #% My final point - because I believe an official rebuttal is needed - is on the Latvian electoral law . #% An official there said to me that my rural region did not need any inward investment as everybody there is a rich farmer . #% How will this ensure its sustainable development in future ? #% It is all complete nonsense . #% British fishermen and farmers are now martyrs to the irresistible ambition of the European Union . #% Until 1997 , every year the European Union did so . #% The growing concern mentioned by Mr Fitzsimons relates to the use of soft PVC in toys and childcare articles such as teething rings , and not of PVC in general . #% I just have two further points . #% Even basic trade , however , would not be possible without an efficient transport system which is available to all . #% With this driving force , the Council must be more progressive in future . #% Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom , not just about repression . #% What Europe needed is a budget that is relevant , that is adding value and that engages with the people , but what Mr Verhofstadt and his colleagues are offering is more of the same . #% 
In England where we do not produce these beautiful wines there is a development which is to be regretted , namely that manufacturers of alcoholized cola and alcoholized lemonade are putting their products into champagne-style bottles , trying to give the impression that they are of good quality when , in fact , they are absolute rubbish to drink and to taste . #% This is not just some act by Parliament to mount a show of force , but at the end of the day Member States will put pressure on individual Members whose parties are in government to get us to change our mind . #% Rather than confining the environmental aspects of aviation to a report solely devoted to that subject , we should be seeing environment threaded through all approaches to this policy area , particularly one which purports to be addressing issues of competitiveness . #% We must recognise the real changes that have taken place in technology over that period . #% I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development . #% As I said , Amendments Nos 17 and 18 asked for a maximum 1 % GNI for own resources . #% I suspect that there will still be a majority in favour , but be aware that people are waking up and will not tolerate these deals for very much longer . #% When my flight was cancelled by Air France on Sunday night at Gatwick airport , there were no instructions , no rights given to us at all . #% Israel also seems to have made the mistake of believing that air power alone was sufficient to dislodge Hizbollah , whereas what was required were more boots on the ground . #% Not only that , but the United Kingdom Government has also completely failed to guarantee to protect our horses from being exported to the continent for slaughter . #% Mr President , the announcement last week was bad enough . #% At the moment , we are facing a number of great challenges and any discussion on the implementation of Cohesion Fund has to include other areas under the umbrella of sustainable development , such as employment and agriculture . #% As both Mr Cunningham and Mr Perry have quite rightly said , we must not underestimate the economic damage that will come from this decision . #% But I find it highly ironic , and I am sure the timing is not coincidental , that on the very day that we are debating blood alcohol , drink driving , road safety , the day before this Parliament is to vote on drink driving , the Commissioner has already made her mind up . #% In particular , I would emphasize once again the importance of projects to guarantee the supply of water to all in the long term . #% I suspect that for Ireland , their period of independence will be a very brief one in their history . #% That is the nature of democracy and democratic decisions . #% It can also help by sharing with Parliament the quarterly information from the EIF and I thank the Commission for agreeing publicly in the Employment Committee to do this . #% This is a deeply unsatisfactory issue dealt with unsatisfactorily by the Commission . #% We urge the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission to take up immediate contacts with the king . #% . Mr President , I welcome this opportunity to present my report on taxation of passenger cars and echo the concerns of Mr Heaton-Harris about the lateness of the hour and the inevitable lack of an audience here . #% But , of course , there is no fundamental difference between the two . #% Firstly , the development of the proposals relating to whistle-blowing will take full account of best practice in several of the Member States . #% I understand your ruling and respect that you are following the Rules of Procedure of this House . #% Sadly it is not just the Erika , but the 1 000 ships that have sunk over the past ten years that really highlight the desperate need to make progress in the areas we are discussing this afternoon . #% In 2003 and early 2004 over 100 MEPs had , at last , begun to listen . #% With the exception of my own Amendment 16 , I do not recommend support for any other amendments . #% Our relations with the United States are not just about trade and businesses making money and , equally , this is not just a United States issue , nor one solely concerning American citizens , as there are a good number of Europeans teaching at these American institutions . #% Mr President , I should first of all like to pay tribute to the rapporteur , who has put forward a very concise and well-presented report and one that we are happy to support . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the President for all his hard work . #% Many people in the UK put their name down to questionnaires sent to me and it is quite clear from deputations of others in the UK that they feel extremely strongly on this issue as with other issues of animal welfare . #% Although ten years have elapsed and great strides have now been made , I believe that a good deal of confidence-building is still required and that we need the openness that many of us have called for in the preparation and the implementation of these reforms . #% Our message is clear : these are our values . #% So our solutions have to be practical and acceptable . #% Can the Council and Commission look at the step-by-step ratcheting-up of pressure that can be built into a new , revised human rights clause ? #% Our resolution does not reflect the fact that in Peshawar today there is an enormous meeting taking place of those seeking - including the moderate Taliban - the restoration of democracy in that country . #% I was astonished to hear Mrs Breyer speaking again and asking questions . #% It is in exceptional circumstances that the unexceptional , normal and rational rule of law is most needed . #% I know from them and from my visit that Bangladesh is a country of proud , hard-working people and a country with great prospects , but one which does need assistance from the more wealthy and developed parts of the world like the European Union . #% We have the blueprints and I urge all of those with the political will to take action , to deliver for the children of Africa . #% We should aim in fact to lead , rather than harness , the globalisation process . #% It is important that the general public realise that this decision was made on the basis of grave political errors , rather than believing that the committee has become a majority-owned property of European chocolate manufacturers . #% We in the European Union have decades of confidence and experience in all these fields . #% It suggested that the United Kingdom should not publish the results of research . #% This does not mean that we endorse the entire list of detailed policy measures listed in the resolution . #% There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars , recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts . #% Frankly , the EU is currently a bit player in Russian society , with only limited influence . #% This denunciation of a fisheries agreement is supposed to be a secret ; well , it was until now . #% The central goals of this label should have been to preserve and celebrate our shared and diverse heritage , but unfortunately , we have not guaranteed that we will add value . #% That is why the procedure to go beyond that into what we might term extra time is so open - in a way humiliating for any government that attempts to take that step . #% Mr President , I deeply regret the need for this resolution concerning journalists condemned to death for blasphemy for what is claimed to be a mistake . #% But let us not forget , either , the 9 600 Palestinian political prisoners , over half of whom are being detained without trial , nearly 400 of whom are under the age of 18 . #% In that way we could show that our own mini-European works council of a German rapporteur , a Dutch group coordinator and myself from the United Kingdom have set a good example in achieving a positive result . #% I support the EU directive 's reference to voluntary and altruistic donations . #% I am happy to repeat today that I still look forward to Slovakia joining the EU at the earliest possible opportunity . #% The Danes knew that they could get a deal and they got it - through great skill in my opinion . #% We are working on a very tight timescale on this legislation , which is due to come into effect on 1 September . #% Finally , we have introduced requirements for streamlined decision-taking . #% The last century in Europe was marked by war in its first half and division into East and West in its second . #% We have , therefore , proposed a return to the definition in the Commission 's revised opinion in Amendment No 6 . #% I am concerned that this debate seems to be taking it for granted that the ten countries are already in , when they are not . #% The new Member States are used to annual scrutiny . #% But we have recognised that in Britain over 10 million animals were slaughtered , many unnecessarily . #% Also outside this House , the British Conservative Party is campaigning in the UK election saying it would not ratify the Treaty of Nice if it were to come to power . #% He is right to suggest that it would not be very popular . #% The fault lies with those Member States which have failed to observe the directive , and that includes my own . #% 
That would indeed be ambitious , and it is not something that I aim to pursue . #% The EU needs to exert united and cohesive pressure on the United States , which it has never done before . #% A judgement has been made on it . #% I hope that they can be sympathetic to Parliament 's request to visit East Timor in an official EP delegation . #% They saw it coming , and with their fishing industry such a boost to their economy , they were right . #% It seems that when JET was set up , the original arrangement was a pragmatic attempt at fair treatment both of the UK employees , in relation to their corresponding numbers at UKAEA , and of staff from other Member States , in an attempt to secure continuity of employment rights for all . #% The French economy and one or two other continental countries could learn from that particular experience . #% However , I wonder if I can tease something out from the Council , perhaps in a broader sense . #% I have long been deeply critical of human rights abuses in Mexico and have been associated with urgency motions passed by this Parliament and other manifestations of our profound concern . #% Would he agree with me if I suggested to him that the rather alarmist headlines of # 3 billion fraud are not borne out by the annual report and the accompanying special reports ? #% It leaves Parliament in a highly embarrassing position and with a few honourable exceptions , notably Mr Gil-Robles , the attitude of the European People ' s Party is highly hypocritical . #% However , although I welcome the initiative , it must be said that it is very general . #% It is a difficult process . #% Otherwise , the danger is the current government in Fiji will go on negotiating forever , but never come to a conclusion . #% The vote was deferred and then the Committee on Industry decided it did not want to produce an opinion after all . #% There are many aspects of this report which produced something of a stalemate between many of us , such as the nature of EU legislation . #% That is why we have produced a very critical report on these guidelines . #% We are of the opinion that the Gál report certainly contains good elements , but overall it stresses too much the role of the EU in areas which we believe to be the exclusive competence of the Member States , such as immigration and judicial systems . #% Many of us on the committee are concerned that the good work of the Commissioner and of Parliament will come to very little unless Member States abide by the letter of the laws we agree in the European Union . #% The third dilemma is that we attach such importance to the development of a universal service in telecommunications that we want to seize on almost any progress . #% If we can work together on that basis , I believe that is a reasonably correct balance in the context of the current Treaties . #% This gives Gaddafi leverage over the EU and , in particular , he has sought to divide the Council by courting the leadership of certain Member States . #% In this case , however , the declaration states that it is the Commission and no one else which should submit draft measures to be taken , contrary to Decision 87/373 . #% I am grateful to you for allowing this question to be taken . #% Better protection along the Thai-Burmese border can give confidence to refugees fleeing Burma 's undemocratic and despotic regime . #% You said that in four years you are going to come back with more legislation . #% I turn to the Commission because within the text there are three declarations and the first is a declaration from the Commission . #% From the point of view of Member States which , for whatever reason , have never given battery recycling a high priority , these totals are unrealistic and , if set , will simply not be reached . #% Let us put pressure on the world community to come together to save the planet for future generations , not on those who do not fully share the enthusiasm of some people for the European institutions . #% First , I should like to say a few words about the changes proposed . #% I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us : in particular Commissioner Liikanen 's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy . #% Secondly , by taking the sentence from the Council , granting Member States a role in determining the criteria to apply to the risk assessment in the light of national circumstances , we are acknowledging the obvious fact that , as both speakers have already said , the risk from natural radiation is somewhat lower in Newcastle than it is in Naples . #% How a Member State meets its obligations is an issue of subsidiarity . #% I know that my colleagues will be happy to respond to the honourable Member in order to keep him informed with any information they are able to obtain . #% We would specify that this must be understood as asking only for Member States to consider introducing the concept of a minimum income as the basis of social protection when they do not currently have such a system . #% All of those I suggest need to be covered by the feedback . #% But this is not some detailed administrative role . #% Real progress here will show our citizens the benefits of European action . #% By issuing qualifications at sectoral and regional level , as well as at national level , this EU proposal will ensure an almost complete grip on qualifications . #% Mr President , I also wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her work on this issue . #% No country can seriously contemplate European membership with nearly six thousand prisoners of conscience , no matter how controversial those people prove to be . #% I do not believe it offers the hope of saving more lives , because I do not think in the short term that this will be achieved , but the possibility of the destruction of many small businesses . #% Even worse the language and the tone of the attacks had more in common with ` Der Stürmer ' in the Germany of Adolf Hitler . #% It is clear that all of us in this House and , indeed , I suspect in the Commission and Council as well , support the cliché that we want to build a Europe for the future , a Europe for our young people . #% However , we need to continue to highlight the problems of non-implementation of waste legislation throughout the Union . #% Unless there has been a last-minute change , these have been left out of the general proposal , which is unfortunate because the general principles of country of origin and mutual recognition , which are found in the service proposal , are applicable in financial services , and it would have been good to have that reinforced by their inclusion in this proposal . #% Mr President , as the first vice-president of the Parliamentary Delegation for Relations with Switzerland , Iceland and Norway over the last three years , I have been privileged to represent Parliament on several occasions at ministerial meetings on the Northern Dimension . #% That information was not given to the committee . #% These new , much more powerful sonars -- one of the loudest sound systems ever devised -- have sparked an epidemic of strandings , internal bleeding , deafness and lung damage wherever they have been tested . #% Mr President , the Middle East is the spiritual home of the three great revealed religions of the world , but sadly also the inspiration for those misguided few who invoke Islam as a justification for terrorist killings , invoking in particular the bloodthirsty traditions of Salafism and Wahhabism . #% Secondly , if we ratify Kyoto alone or without the United States it will mean taking certain actions that are going to be painful . #% You can not find a compte rendu of what people actually said in the Council . #% We on the committee will be looking at this carefully because we understand that the Court of Auditors will be coming to us for more money , staff and resources in the future . #% As she acknowledges , the European Union has a particular and important role to play : as a major donor of aid , as the biggest donor of humanitarian aid in the world and as the biggest trading block in the world . #% China 's role needs scrutiny and that country must be reminded that it is officially opposed to the nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula . #% If anyone is trying to give the impression that we are trying to set official against official , to destroy the contribution of loyalty made by officials over the years , to overlook the individual qualities of individuals by making the proposal that we do , they are sadly misled . #% Against that background , the Commission adopted a document on 18 July entitled ` New orientations for the reform of personnel policy ' . #% While it is true that the process has not yet been completed , it has been set on an irrevocable course . #% Poland , Spain and some other countries , however , are insisting on returning to the opaque Nice formula , which is neither very fair nor very logical . #% They should know that they work in an organisation in which appraisals of their performance are not bureaucratic exercises that are carried out every two years and put in a filing cabinet and not referred to again , that the appraisal process is part of the overall quality of management and processes within the Commission , part of giving all members of staff the feeling that it is part of their personal development . #% This legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives . #% I am , therefore , concerned at the speed with which it has been considered by Parliament , driven at least in part by an ambitious presidency that will be here today and gone tomorrow . #% I also particularly welcome the fact that in his text he describes the forthcoming WTO round as a development round . #% If I want to invest overseas , I will buy an emerging markets fund . #% A general opt-out is bad for the welfare of workers , bad for a proper work-life balance , damaging to efforts to encourage women to return to the labour market and , as the statistics show , not at all helpful in the drive to boost productivity . #% I am prepared to go into the most thorough detail in order to ensure that we do not get any repetition of the misunderstanding that has led to various communications that have manifested a complete failure to comprehend the purpose and detail of what has been proposed so far . #% 
Approximating the fines will help to stop this activity and make people work together . #% It takes years for a drug to get from development through clinical trials and it is only after that that this amendment might come into play . #% If Members are wondering why the EU is so unpopular in the United Kingdom , it is because of incidents such as this . #% Mr President , it is a pleasure to rise to a full public gallery . #% In listening to your answer , President-in-Office , I would remind you that in too many cases that trade is linked to human rights abuses in the form of the involuntary removal of organs from prisoners due for execution in China . #% But if the impact in the EU will be severe , in many parts of the developing world it will be devastating , especially for women who are disproportionately represented in these sectors . #% I would just pick up on one issue , which concerns asking for staff to be trained to help people with reduced mobility and disabilities so that they can have the same access to public transport as those of us who are able-bodied have . #% Because of the volume of discards our fishermen believe there are more fish in the sea than the scientists say there are . #% For example , we can not support paragraph 8 , which asks all developing countries to draft tourism development plans , to produce annual reports on figures and contributions , because that is not appropriate in all cases and in many countries it would be a pretty low priority . #% We know the public is sceptical about Europe , but if people see us acting on things they care about , they might feel friendlier towards Europe . #% At the beginning of this year a macroeconomic dialogue became absolutely essential and no doubt the first meeting of the partners to that macroeconomic dialogue next week will be an historic step . #% in writing . - The situation in the Gaza Strip is deplorable . #% We are dealing with matters which may be simple on paper yet have important implications for jobs . #% That prolonged litany of negligences and errors has damaged the image of this institution . #% I and my British Conservative colleagues are voting for this report but with one important proviso . #% We would have preferred to have voted on the compromise amendments . #% Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured . #% The organization which informed me is very well respected in Sri Lanka . #% author . - Madam President , with your agreement I should like to begin by saying that last week over one thousand BBC staff , friends and colleagues of Alan Johnston gathered at vigils for him at BBC buildings across the world . #% In some areas of activity , the EU may also be able to make a useful contribution . #% Sooner or later , we have to tackle , within this general issue of allergies and labelling , the issue of a special interest which has always stood in the way of accurate labelling of some products and of applying the same provisions to all products . #% However , after the slaughter of thousands in Matabeleland the ZANU-PF Government has brought the country to the verge of economic collapse and starvation . #% It is not a fresh instrument of social or employment policy , nor is it a fresh instrument of environmental policy . #% If the law is defective , then it must be amended . #% Commissioner , you spoke a moment ago of the stalemate in this situation . #% The European Union and the wider international community can be powerful bodies when they act with unity , consistency and determination . #% Professor Trakatellis for example has commented on global television networks , and it will be very important for the public to know what is being done despite the empty Chamber tonight . #% I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks . #% Would you confirm whether this is , or is not , the case ? #% The views of the European inquiry were clear about how a future outbreak should be handled . #% So I repeat my question to him : Was it discussed ? #% As you say , this Parliament can also claim a share in the success story . #% We can not lower our guard , because by recycling animal by-products as feed we risk also recycling the pathogens that cause BSE , foot-and-mouth and other diseases . #% In conclusion , we look forward to hearing how the Commission is going to encourage that development of fast Internet access , how it is going to stimulate that provision across the Member States , what further action may be necessary , and what further support we can give to this crucial aim for the future of the European economy . #% Can I say to Mr Pomés Ruiz that the answers to the questions that he has raised , for instance on audit , are available in a number of documents which have been conveyed to Parliament . #% There is alleged harassment of the opposition , the silencing of critical voices and the establishment of a network of patronage throughout the country . #% Finally , as far as we ourselves are concerned , let me refer to the debate raging this week in my own country , the United Kingdom , on how human rights can be reconciled , given the changed threats of terrorism , people trafficking and organised crime . #% To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure , because some Member States spend considerably more than others . #% How is that going to protect dealers who already have a substantial investment ? #% Only competitive business and successful entrepreneurs can do that . #% Does the President-in-Office agree that it is now time to press even harder for the parties concerned to find a negotiated solution ? #% As I am sure he is aware , a Senate committee is now looking at this influence and perhaps will shed some light on what was a rather sordid part of the US presidential election campaign . #% However , the tide has now turned and if they vote ` yes ' in Saturday 's referendum , they will have done everything that we and the UN have asked of them . #% Therefore , the Commission must take appropriate measures to ensure that SAPARD funds are not lost because of late implementation . #% I have to say that it is rather disappointing that the two opinions from the committees have been largely ignored in the Committee of Citizens ' Freedoms . #% We are , as the honourable Member was good enough to acknowledge , making a serious effort to improve upon that in the European Commission . #% He has further said that at that level the addition of these proteins - which intended to sustain the holding capacity of a much larger proportion of water - would therefore become unnecessary . #% It is for all these reasons that we must vote this proposal down . #% Yes , we should encourage more extensive livestock rearing by adjusting the way premia are paid . #% Like you , I have discovered just how controversial this matter is . #% We would call in particular on the Chinese authorities to set an example to the world and hold a full , public and transparent inquiry into the outbreak of this disease and its means of transmission . #% The British newspapers will be full of GBP 1m per MEP - that is what they cost ! #% We must not fail those who look to us to succeed . #% Therefore , coach and horses are being driven through the rule of law by the government that purports to supply the next Commissioner for Freedom , Security and Justice . #% We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened . #% `` The city clocks had only just gone three , but it was quite dark already and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air . '' #% These measures have had a clear impact ; the number of confirmed cases has dropped since 1992 from 36 , 000 to 8 , 000 and it is still declining . #% But it is not only unfair , it is extremely damaging and I will explain why . #% My group will be supporting Mrs Roth-Behrendt 's call for a marketing ban to be introduced at the earliest moment . #% Also , what about the emergency workers - paramedics and others . #% What we do know is that the Basel Convention should have stopped this crime and has failed to do so , and we need to know why . #% I am part of the advisory council for the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre and we have been raising the issue of caged beds for a number of years now . #% Of course democracy and human rights should be encouraged in all the states of the world which are unfortunate enough not to enjoy them already . #% In the interests of transparency it should be the duty of the trader to disclose to the consumer in advance information relating to aspects of goods and services offered . #% It has failed in its conservation goals , it has failed to maintain jobs and it has also failed largely in the area of international agreements in defending third countries and their stocks and developing their industries . #% The phrase `` free and fair '' should be avoided : it is loaded vocabulary which is always ruthlessly targeted by the media in any post-election circumstances . #% 
I should be grateful if you could actually do something about it so that at least outside the hemicycle I and other people like me do not have to encounter smoke . #% The directive will produce a framework in which they are able to do that . #% To set a date now , or even to set a date for a date , is premature . #% Mr President , I wish to notify the House that there is a mistake on the voting list as to where Amendment 24 splits . #% In fact it is fair to say that the development of portable electric power , particularly rechargeable electric power , has revolutionised our lives . #% We do not have a very good relationship with the Council on economic and monetary issues . #% It has the right of initiative but it is not the European government . #% The many messages from the European Union , and indeed from the European Parliament , plus the many personal messages of support and solidarity , were very much appreciated . #% Not only will it be exposed as economic lunacy , but it will be profoundly damaging to the European project . #% Mr President , as chairman of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , I should like it confirmed -- for the record -- that all the letters of assessment on the Commissioners -- designate have been forwarded to Mr Barroso , President -- designate of the Commission . #% I personally watched Mr Pasty put a card in seat 493 behind him one minute ago . #% The case for such a code has been set up by the Ombudsman , Jacob Söderman . #% Mr President , I would be grateful if you could pass on to President Borrell our thanks for his very kind words yesterday in memory of our colleague , Phillip Whitehead . #% This is a very important piece of health and safety legislation , building upon the corpus of such legislation that we have adopted at European level over the last twenty years . #% Last time round , we were told it was a small delegation - it turned out they took 75 journalists . #% It is a delight to have Mr Haarder with us again , in a different role . #% Her appointment contributes to advancing gender equality in the External Action Service . #% The balance of power , in that sense , has certainly shifted . #% I trust that the participation of Gibraltar within the European political system will soften some of the nationalistic tensions we have seen in that part of the Union . #% The rapporteur said that state structures in Bangladesh work badly and Mrs Maes derided some of the advances that Bangladesh has made in recent years . #% The document produced by the NGO forum was so bad that the Secretary-General , Mary Robinson , was unable to recommend it to the governments . #% For the first time , by way of an intergovernmental convention , the EC gave itself a special , unique and comprehensive regime of recognition and enforcement . #% Clearly , the thrust of the Commission ' s thinking that has gone into this report and indeed our response has focused on two aspects : competitiveness and coordination , because research capability combined with the ability to translate that research into products and services of real commercial value is going to be the key to the competitiveness of the European Union and the enlarged Union into this new century . #% With Bulgaria , we also have continued widespread discrimination against the Roma community in housing , healthcare , education and employment . #% Lastly I am concerned at reports that in the computer business itself systems are still being sold that do not sufficiently take account of the millennium bug . #% But there is one point I would like to make and underline . #% The European Parliament must recognise that sustainable economic growth is a prerequisite and a catalyst for sustainable development , rather than being a threat or alternative to it . #% Everyone in Europe must enjoy the same level of protection . #% In the past , my colleagues have had increasingly uncomfortable experiences attending these conferences , for example the Johannesburg Conference on Sustainable Development . #% We have had the speech by the President of the Commission and we have had the hearings , but the second stage is the work programme of the European Commission . #% I hope that it will not be long delayed . #% Hence , we will be opposing the Commission 's proposal . #% The way forward is clear : the Government must ensure respect for human rights and internal law . #% Unfortunately , we have cut the budget this time compared to the last time and if we are serious about assisting Kim Dae-jung with his sunshine policy that sends exactly the wrong signals . #% I particularly like the way you have stressed yet again the importance of voluntary initiatives , which many of us believe are so crucial to the success of CSR , and the way you have highlighted that usage of CSR is indeed mushrooming . #% We must think again ; trade is a two way thing . #% Since this - and amendments in a similar vein - were not adopted , we have been forced to abstain on this report . #% We express sympathy , of course , to all those affected , whether they are British , Turkish or other citizens of Europe . #% Have we really achieved the sort of significant advances in safety that we want ? #% I have had to make concessions , I have moved a long way from my initial position and I would very strongly thank everyone in the committee and in the House who have also made concessions . #% I would appreciate your ruling on the correct procedures under Rule 151 ( 3 ) , as in my view the very democratic credibility of this House is now at stake . #% The Swedish Presidency , as we have heard during the debate , has raised high hopes that we may achieve over the next six months the restoration of a unified Europe , but I believe the time for rhetoric has passed and what we are all looking for now are results . #% It is about the whole management structure of the Commission ; the relationship between the staff and their directors ; the relationship between the directors and the directors-general ; the relationship between the directors-general and the Commissioners and their cabinets . #% These issues are tricky because they expose both the exaggerated self-importance of small states and the folie de grandeur of the big states . #% Will Commissioner Prodi retract his statement - if it is true - that Ukraine is no more European than New Zealand ? #% The signs referred to by Nel van Dijk which the Dutch may or may not adopt in the year 2000 are currently compulsory in Ireland and Portugal , they are optional in France and Germany , where they may make them compulsory , whilst all the other countries have the Vienna Convention white ellipse except the UK , Spain and Portugal which do not have anything . #% We have a regulation that represents a shameful capitulation to the F-gas industry . #% These reports need a real overhaul . #% We can go to tariff only , as proposed for 2006 . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I think many of us should welcome any initiative that takes power away from the European Union and other political governments and devolves power closer to the citizen . #% We know also that time is running out , but that is not a reason to stop the ECSC clock ahead of schedule . #% We hear far too much about the precautionary principle . #% Two years after the declaration of a Doha development round , next week in Cancún we have an opportunity to make globalisation work for the many rather than the few . #% The sales promotion mutual recognition directive -- which is an integral part of this -- has been with the Council for 15 months . #% It has also been alleged that some operators there have been spraying such plants with fungicide in order to mask traces of that particular disease , meaning that the disease shows itself at a later stage . #% I would still hope that a Community network of surveillance and control would be agreed as a good way forward to settling the matters you have referred to . #% That means that when the single currency is created we will have opportunities to address a wider agenda . #% The broader issue is , could we ask the Parliament 's services - and I am not blaming them in any way because this is a Commission issue - to ensure that if a Member 's question is reclassified in this way , and is not down for an answer by the Commissioner to whom it is redirected , we are told about that , so that it can be reformulated if necessary and the Commissioner to whom it is addressed can answer it . #% Clearly while that persecution is going on by the Indonesian military we would not also be wanting to support that or give any message of support . #% Contrary to what we have heard over here , South Africa has made considerable concessions on port and sherry in the interests of making a wide agreement . #% I invite the Commissioner to join with his colleague , Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , to ensure that the results of this monitoring are fully evaluated , both for the second round of the elections in the Congo , and for the benefit of future European electoral missions . #% I also want to give more consideration to what the agencies are doing and take a more differentiated approach to them depending on their particular roles and activities which we have not done in the past . #% The Dutch then buried it and now , in a scene that reminds me of the Hammer House of Horror , the arm is reaching up out of the coffin . #% It seems that the much-vaunted democratic credentials of this Parliament could be enhanced by such an investigation . #% There are governments - Spain , for instance - which object to the system of double majority in the Council and want to revert to the Nice system , which is complex , not understandable and not a very sensible system . #% We should look at the change in sentiment in the market that has taken place over the time that we have been reviewing these texts and think about the mobile market which is still enormously dynamic , has shown terrific rates of growth , is introducing new products all the time , and is within sight of getting mobile communications to two-thirds of the European population . #% 
I am not quite so happy about the answer which I have just heard , although I understand that we are moving in the right direction . #% But these people are not resorting to this sort of action lightly ; they are escaping from terror , war , torture , rape , vile regimes posing as governments and , of course , in some cases , poverty . #% Since I arrived here last year , it has been remarkable how many people have admitted privately to me that we should never have joined and we should leave at the earliest opportunity . #% Member States are also seeking to apply those principles in wider international fora . #% We could do more at this end , in terms of educating consumers and suppliers in the Union , to help them realise what the effect of their actions is on the ecology and development in the countries of origin and to stop people from regarding bushmeat as a luxury delicacy , whereas what we are really looking at is the potential extinction of animals in certain places . #% It would be less time-consuming and less expensive surely to have used that rather than go through the procedure we have just gone through . #% I hope that this will facilitate and indeed speed up the work of the House , notably during voting time . #% It is as if you all have some higher calling and know what is good for the ordinary plebs of Europe . #% We in Britain had that opportunity . #% I strongly urge the General Affairs Council , on 22 July , to beef up the sanctions and to allow no excuses from Member States that their multilateral treaty obligations override the sanction restrictions . #% It is often said that politics is about providing yesterday 's solutions to today 's problems . #% But the rapporteur - as well as this House and the Commission - is concerned that the rules are clear , that there is a price to pay for anti-competitive measures , but that the needs of citizens and consumers are not lost sight of . #% Mr President , it is always daunting to follow the measured tread of Mr Bowis as he spreads reassurance through the Chamber . #% I used to work for a former Finance Minister in Britain called Dennis Healey , who you might know . #% I have to say that whilst we are looking at the concerns of the tourists , I think that the owners have been somewhat unfairly treated . #% May I inform you that my colleague Mr Fayot is chairman of the Rules Committee . #% I think you are showing substantial tolerance - at least in listening , though not in your rulings . #% I want to congratulate Brian Simpson , the rapporteur , on the way he has steered the European postal services debate and directive over the past few years . #% Mr President and Mr Commissioner , enlargement must succeed for all our sakes . #% We have managed to bring in hundreds of amendments , which says a lot for the fertile imagination of Parliament . #% Ai Weiwei is an heir to China 's magnificent and ancient artistic traditions . #% Economic efficiency depends on social justice . #% We believe our proposal will speed up the necessary research , if it is taken seriously . #% And that public concern has not gone away with the decisions of last June . #% Especially vulnerable are children for whom the single market should offer future hope and prosperity , not present peril and danger . #% It is within this context that I , as your rapporteur , welcome the agreement on maritime transport between the European Community and the People 's Republic of China . #% It is amazing what we all know about these things ! #% He is quite right to point out that we want to avoid legal proceedings or court proceedings if possible . #% It is perhaps in that context we have the opportunity to make one or two remarks , rather than the specific points contained in this relatively short report . #% We should actually be able to vote our amendment quite within the bounds of the financial perspective and should our amendment fall , we as a Group will , of course , reserve our right to consider whether the Commission 's proposal is the right one . #% However , it would seem to me that neither would the benefits of a merged market , at least from the Euronext side . #% This is of course a difficult decision for everybody involved in the handling of the matter : it is difficult for the officials , it is difficult for the Ministers themselves ; but it has to be done in a way which is both humane and also effective . #% A new explosion of discriminatory bilateral and regional agreements could substitute global liberalisation , eroding the multilateral and rules-based system of the WTO . #% If the investigations in the USA show that the anthrax outbreak came from Iraq and therefore American public opinion becomes overwhelmingly in favour of an attack on Iraq and - I imagine that George Bush would find it very hard to resist such overwhelming public opinion - what would be the Council 's position ? #% All our mechanisms in the EU for ensuring that human rights standards are respected are frankly inadequate : no peer review , no monitoring , no enforcement . #% The details of this must be worked out , as Mr Barón Crespo said earlier , in an interinstitutional agreement between our institutions . #% In many ways the use of fluorinated gases has already exhibited the principle of substitution , given that many applications that were previously used with CFCs have been substituted with HFCs . #% That is why this Parliament and the Member State parliaments need to act . #% It turned tens of thousands of French men and women into amateur ticket touts . #% I accept that the cost of Galileo is around EUR 3 billion , which means the involvement of the private sector is essential , but the benefits to Europe in both economic and social terms will be immense . #% Now we have expressed our concerns about the EU meddling in military matters on many occasions and our reservations have not been eased by developments at Nice . #% Financial reports of any enterprises , including trusts and charities , should be subject to similar rules right across the Community , and there should be mutual recognition of the qualifications of those empowered to sign audit reports . #% The sick were dragged from the hospitals or left to die . #% Finally , I would say that when we sit down today , I hope we will perhaps feel satisfied and happy and have a warm glow inside us , but also feel that we have done something not just for our egos but for the environment . #% Arms transfers must be subject to legal controls , not just in the EU , but across the world . #% We must do more to facilitate that , certainly , but in the meantime we must also do more to have legal migration , so as to ensure that the vacant positions we have are filled . #% If we do not have that kind of information , when it comes to renewal , how can we give a considered opinion on the merits of the new agreement ? #% We have not got what we wanted , she has not got what she wanted , a lot of other people have not got what they wanted . #% The Vice-President at the time , Mr David Martin , undertook to inquire and refer the matter to you , but since you are now in the chair I shall ask you directly . #% Finally , it is a pity that the new context of justice and extradition cooperation nonetheless permits the completely unjustified extradition from the UK of Gary McKinnon , a computer hacker who has Asperger 's syndrome , rather than his being prosecuted in the UK . #% It will certainly make it better for the Polish environment if we comply with the rules . #% Tax is a matter for nation-states , for domestic governments , and should remain the preserve of domestic governments , which are democratically elected and democratically accountable , tax being one of the most fundamental aspects of nationhood and statehood . #% The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far . #% in writing . - I fully support the calls in this resolution for stronger rules in the area of competition policy . #% The vote tomorrow should be seen as a commitment to drive for real change at the UN , in the EU and in our Member States . #% As chairman of Parliament 's Delegation for relations with the United States , I had arranged a meeting this morning with President Santer in advance of our visit next week to Washington to discuss those issues that are pressing in relation to European-US affairs . #% It should be obliged to choose one of those options and either modify its proposal to take account of our objections or withdraw it - I would underline that we are not obliging it to withdraw the proposal , it is just one of the options - or present a proposal under the legislative procedure . #% Mr President , Mrs Echerer , having kept us all informed on a subject which too often is relegated to the sidelines of our debates here , has shown herself to be a late night performer deserving of her intellectual property and of successive royalties . #% I am sorry the rapporteur did not have the time to tell us how much insourcing there has been , but there has been a great deal of outsourcing . #% So how are we going to evaluate the wider effects of our own macroeconomic policy ? #% I therefore hope this House will join with me in deploring the majority decision in the Conference of Presidents . #% A complete culture change is required in the Council , such that this Parliament is treated as a true partner . #% One bad news story may blow confidence in e-trade for years . #% In the wake of the Erika and Prestige disasters , we must ask the Commission why the agreement seeks to provide the advantages of unrestricted access and non-discriminatory treatment to European or Chinese ship owners who choose to register their ships in third countries . #% However , we do not know which is which . #% Our amendments , which provide for adaptations , accommodations and accessibility and include publicity , are absolutely crucial in ensuring that disabled people are involved . #% 
The challenge now for us as the European Parliament is to exercise our supervisory powers over EU legislation . #% The British Government is currently playing with fire in its ambivalence on the subject . #% I would like to draw attention to one particular idea in the report which is valuable in terms of the legitimacy of these institutions of global governance . #% We wanted to see positive outcomes and indeed that is what I wrote in my report . #% He virtually neglected the role of the ombudsman . #% As I have said to Parliament and to the Belgian Government , I believe that many of the difficulties encountered in this project are due to serious management problems that originated with the management structure of Berlaymont 2000 . #% I hope that your services will take that into account when you next consider moving legislative items on the agenda . #% Her stance hardly fits in with Mr Blair 's ` red lines ' vis-à-vis the Constitution . #% Pressure is now mounting on Syria from Saudi Arabia , Russia , the US and Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon . #% Firstly , nowhere does this report say that fighting racism means you should have no immigration controls . #% Over three years ago my own report on infringements urged the Commission ` to examine the possibility of introducing a uniform system of minimum penalties across the European Union ... to strengthen fishers ' confidence in the fundamental principle of equal treatment , which implies objective criteria for classification and rating , as well as for infringements and penalties ' . #% As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts . #% On the one hand he has called for the Palestine authority to bear down on the terrorists in its midst but on the other he has crippled those very agencies which have the capacity to take such action . #% I am glad to see that Mr Spencer is upholding the fine traditions of ideological inconsistency which we see all too often in the Conservative Party in Britain today . #% The resolution floats the idea of a solidarity contribution on air tickets , but that should not be the only avenue , and like Mrs Kinnock I should like to suggest other possibilities . #% Finally I should say to the Commission in particular that if we could , in all circumstances , treat these small but important debates seriously but without the kind of hysteria that we sometimes get on either side , this Parliament would be a happier and a wiser place . #% Secondly , too many Members of this House delight in issuing press releases seeking to trivialise legislation that is entirely necessary , justified and proportionate . #% I wish the Finnish presidency every success . #% I extend the sympathies of Mrs Cerdeira and myself to the relatives of the victims . #% That objection is based solely upon not agreeing with particular decisions in one or two areas of technology . #% I have every confidence in stating that the CIA is directly responsible for the illegal seizure , removal , abduction and detention of people on the territory of Member States . #% I am pleased that my statement has caused him to retract those original remarks . #% Now , of course , it is time to pick the President - the big global figurehead of the European Union . #% However , Parliament can not be totally happy about the fate of decaBDE , which remains to be decided . #% Mr President , the appalling treatment meted out to the Albanian population of Kosovo must be totally denounced and implacably opposed , but withdrawal of the peace monitors and the launching of the NATO bombing offensive was not the way to do this . #% We are very interested to see how this year 's situation develops over the course of 2002 . #% The UK , of course , remains outside the Schengen area . #% Whatever our views on the kind of Europe we want to see , this week we can celebrate the reuniting of the nations of Europe . #% The Commissioner told Parliament 's committee one month ago , when Mr Cadec put this question to her , that she was not mindful to support subsidies to compensate for the extra cost of fuel . #% Not one PPE-DE speaker has explained what the objection is to the idea of people having sexual and reproductive health rights . #% Then the Euro Group announced that the permanent mechanism would be based on the European financial stability facility and that it might involve the private sector on a case-by-case basis following IMF practice . #% Mr President , the Liberal Group very much supports the work of the rapporteur and most of the amendments , although not those of the ARE . #% In the context of the apparent reluctance to be present here tonight , the substance of our question has added relevance . #% Of course there still is a time for a real debate about Europe 's future . #% The aim of this regulation is to prevent this decommissioned mercury from entering the world market . #% What action can we take to eliminate this in future ? #% You will know that this is the only Council that has not produced any documents in line with the Council 's requests , so I would like to know when we might see some more detail on that in particular ? #% A more comprehensive report , focusing on large-scale infrastructure , will be completed by the end of this year . #% Finally , we have very mixed feelings about Article 28 and the amendment to it . #% Children also need to understand the consequences of regimes based on totalitarian ideologies -- the Nazi responsibility for the Holocaust is clear ; the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and China have also committed mass murder on an enormous scale . #% These recent revelations of these high levels of radiation found in casks and rolling stock used to ship nuclear waste are unfortunately yet another example of the nuclear industry shooting itself in the foot . #% As they approach their own date of entry into the European Union , it is essential that we monitor that situation more closely than perhaps has been the case hitherto . #% The WTO ruling gives neither , and that is why we have to confront it , and we definitely have to appeal . #% In relation to that , my report also asks the Commission to study how emissions from international maritime traffic could be included in Directive 2001/81/EC on national emissions ceilings when that is reviewed . #% We must make more and better use of it . #% I wonder if the Italian presidency will recognize from the form of this question that this is blatantly a matter of domestic rather than European concern . #% I also call for enhanced regional cooperation and economic integration of India and Pakistan with SAARC and SAFTA , which enhances the confidence-building measures between the two states which , until recently , were on the verge of war . #% At first I thought this was a mistake but the deeper we went into the Bosnian state the more we saw of these huge posters . #% Cambodia 's decline into political instability must surely prompt us into supporting any impetus towards democracy that rises in that troubled country . #% That will be the normal period within which Member States will be expected to comply with the requirements of this directive in relation to junior doctors . #% I was worried about the weekly working hours and how they should not exceed the 54 hours over a four-month reference period . #% However , if the Greek Cypriots reject the Annan Plan , Turkish Cypriots will be EU citizens who are denied recognition and representation and who are being kept impoverished by economic sanctions applied by the EU . #% If that is so I would welcome it because I think that it is not merely the function of the Rules of Procedure to provide a minimum framework , a simply reductionist approach to the rules , but to encourage the right and rational outcomes . #% I hope and I believe that it will do just that . #% There are two conventions on these subjects : the Bunker Oil Convention 2001 , and the Hazardous and Noxious Substances Convention of 1996 . #% The greatest social benefit , the greatest solidarity , is for people to have jobs . #% Also it is important that the core labour standards - these ILO standards - are given the dedication and focus needed for their implementation , as indeed the rapporteur so eloquently pointed out . #% Are we in favour of needless , additional regulation ? #% That is the whole point of agreeing common European legislation in the areas we want it , such as the environment and the common market . #% The Constitution redefines the European Union . #% As Mrs Wallis said , it should be as easy for people to cross borders as it is for widgets or potatoes . #% It is a useful self-discipline and I hope we will be able to institute it during our consideration of the legislative programme . #% I would ask the President to express our concern to the Ankara Government about this incident and our hope that this unfortunate incident will not affect the solution to the Cyprus problem and the peace negotiations which are continuing at this moment , and to express our hope that Mr Tsiakourmas will be released as soon as possible . #% Mr President , I begin by congratulating Mr Deva on what I believe is a comprehensive , balanced and meaningful set of proposals . #% However , my question is slightly more fundamental than Mr Kerr 's . #% The Barcelona Summit will be a major milestone during the Spanish Presidency and it is essential that we reply to the downward global economic trend by further deepening and strengthening the process laid down at Lisbon and further developed at Stockholm and Göteborg . #% 
In September 1999 , James Mawdsley , from the north-east of England was sentenced to 17 years ' solitary confinement in a Burmese prison . #% If anything needed a visionary , innovative and international response , it is the prevalence of these communicable diseases . #% The original 1993 directive applies to employees , but this proposal has two legal bases : Article 137 covers occupational health and safety , while Article 71 covers operational safety . #% in writing . - We approved of the proposal that the existing rules relating to the importation of live animals , meat and meat products should remain in force until replaced by measures adopted under the new regulatory framework . #% My original concerns were that the Commission 's proposals were too vague , would go too far and that the considerable costs of implementing and enforcing this directive could be pushed down the supply chain , leading to increased costs to industry and the consumer . #% Therefore the significant thing about Vienna was the way in which we are now starting to drop dogma and ideology and recognise that there are some major problem areas in which the European Union must act . #% The great danger , if all these extra items were to be adopted on the agenda , is that the deadline of December 2000 would inevitably be missed . #% Madam President , I notice that my name is missing on page 26 of the English version of the roll-call vote on Lange . #% Many will say that the plan of action to exclude from the human food chain all parts of bovine carcasses which could convey infection , if it were transmissible to man , should have started five years ago . #% If the people of one country want greater social protection at the risk of damaging their competitive position , then they should vote for a government that will do that . #% Better to schedule the conference for 2003 , with the 2004 European Parliament elections allowing a popular verdict on some of the key choices being made by governments with enlargement under way . #% As the rapporteur has already mentioned , it points out that this is not a political programme , but one designed to enhance administrative cooperation between Member States ' tax officials . #% We hope that these restrictions will be relaxed and we have made that case explicitly and repeatedly to the Vietnamese authorities . #% However , let me concentrate on two points in the report . #% However , we do have serious misgivings with regard to references to an EU social pillar , an ambitious social agenda , a harmonised immigration policy and restrictions upon an agricultural single market , and stress that areas of education and military and defence are the preserve of Member States . #% Mr President , my name was mentioned . #% This morning he has really blotted his copy book because , last month , he permitted all the signs saying ` Yes to Turkey ' to remain up in this Chamber for a considerable period of time . #% So , with Labour you can take your pick . #% I just wondered how the Council expects the EU to meet the increasing challenge of illegal entry and the need for returns when in its draft budget for 2007 , and compared to the Commission 's bid , it has actually cut the appropriations for Frontex , the Borders Agency to which the Minister referred several times , and the European Return Fund . #% Clearly Hong Kong has to have autonomy in its own economic affairs but it also has to have the support of China . #% One could express mild surprise that it was deemed to be in order . #% It is also timely that we have a joint debate of this sort for the reasons that the Commissioner was expressing during his comments , and I would like to dwell a little on why it is so timely . #% Surely it would be preferable here , in addition to national central bankers , to have representatives from the economic ministries who are themselves responsible for formulating short and medium-term economic policies . #% Mr President , can I first congratulate the two rapporteurs , Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg on their excellent presentation of the expectations for next year . #% The resolution points to the prolongation of the crisis of humanitarian dimensions as the consequence of Iraq 's refusal to implement resolution 687 and others . #% Fine , but how long is that going to take when a parallel importer can be prevented from giving the consumer a quality product at a price which benefits them both ? #% We will also , in the longer term , create a cleaner and greener environment for ourselves and for our children . #% I would therefore say that the most enduring teams should be built up from scratch and not simply bought up . #% Peace will come if , and only when , Israel , Palestine and the neighbouring states realise they want peace so much that they are prepared to live it . #% I think the signs for change here are not very good . #% So , given all these positive effects , it comes as a great shock to realise that the 20 % energy efficiency target is the one part of the 2020 package which is currently heading for failure , as the Commissioner said . #% My information is that in the last six years British people have been abroad and shot at least 40 African elephants , 32 leopards , 18 polar bears , six hippos -- I could go on . #% We need active labour market policies to help people find and keep work . #% I add my own congratulations to Mr Fatuzzo and his own way of pressing the needs of pensioners . #% Mr President , this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled . #% Finally , on a personal note , an existing concern I have with this whole regulation is that it is insufficiently flexible for the small enterprise in particular . #% Failing that , standards must be as high as possible . #% It is an honour to be chosen as the rapporteur for this important report . #% They are deliberately saying that there is an area of scrutiny and oversight in which this Parliament , in the matter of labelling , should play no part . #% The discrepancies between balances in one year and the next are regular , routine and unacceptable . #% Instead of suppressing Hamas , Islamic Jihad and other extremist elements , the Palestinian agencies are now too often in bed with the extremists . #% This is not a second-best option ; on the contrary , it would give Turkey most of the benefits of full membership with few of the costs . #% It is entirely appropriate as a response to the telecommunications communication from the Commission and exactly what we needed to give us a basis on which to move into our further consideration of the whole electronic communications package , which we shall be debating again in a month 's time . #% I hope that the whole of Parliament will support Amendment 29 , so that we do not dilute the message that Hitler and Stalin were joint criminals who vented their anger on the peoples of Europe . #% There were two main areas where the Court of Auditors identified problems . #% This question of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not just a one-off . #% Grand gestures about free trade from the G8 leaders at Gleneagles now need to be transformed into a flexible negotiating strategy to deliver on all parts of an aid , trade and debt relief package . #% People involved in not-for-profit are often some of the most active and constructive citizens that we have . #% Having said that , I would just say thank you to my colleagues for their friendship , their support and their messages in recent weeks . #% It should not end up being the case that some producers bear an unfair share of the financial burden that this directive implies . #% I understand that this week the military junta in Rangoon has actually turned down the European Union 's proposed mission there on the grounds that there is no forced labour there . #% Mr President , I am happy to follow Mr Harbour in that same spirit which characterised the committee . #% Sudan , Saudi Arabia , Nepal and Zimbabwe will not and should not be members of this new Council . #% We are beyond that now . #% Appendix II will make no difference . #% Should the European Council not follow this course and be seen to be trampling on the democratic procedures in small Member States , this will only serve to further alienate a European public which is genuinely in search of more information . #% At the beginning of this process we should acknowledge that there should not be the sort of rush to condemn based on the Court of Auditors report that we see in much of the press this morning and over recent days . #% That is the reason that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is calling for a Commission taskforce of relevant directorate-generals to develop integrated strategies to combat social exclusion . #% I would also like to draw colleagues ' attention to the positive response by BNFL to the two reports made by the NII , one on the records incident and the other on the control and safety management regime at Sellafield . #% Socialism , for all its idealism , does not work . #% Mr President , Mrs Swiebel has done good work in her survey of human rights breaches in Member States and I am sad that the Christian Democrats and Conservatives are so opposed to it . #% Could you comment on what the Foreign Ministers said about the exchange of national officials in order to strengthen administration ? #% Whilst it is correct that the EU should strengthen its common foreign and security policy , it is not Britain 's position that the CFSP should be communitized . #% Mr President , I was the Member responsible for the successful amendment to the Corbett Report , as a result of which the book where you sign written declarations under Rule 51 was moved to just outside this Chamber instead of being stuck in an office which nobody could find . #% I hope we can get some sort of an agreement within Parliament on how we handle A-30 in the future . #% There are obviously subcategories - we can not simplify too much , unfortunately - but nonetheless there are these three main groupings . #% 
We need more private investment , more jobs , more productivity and more sustained growth . #% Is it any wonder they have the highest growth rates in Europe ? #% Those unable to leave Eritrea are either subject to open-ended conscription in the army , or have to scratch out a living on the fringes of an economy bankrupted by years of futile war with neighbouring Ethiopia , widespread corruption and mismanagement of the economy . #% Because this is EU control for the sake of it . #% The integration of the WEU into the EU is not a realistic proposition in the near future . #% The question today , which we look to the Commissioner and to the Council of Ministers to answer , is whether or not we can return to a real partnership with the USA . #% I hope that will be the first step towards reinstatement of these teachers . #% It is important that we look at the idea of banning smoking in public places in the European Parliament . #% 90 % of our GDP is generated by internal trade within the European Union . #% I also think that at the moment not enough information is going out in the Member States to the poultry industry and to those who are actually running our poultry farms , to ensure that , firstly , there is increased biosecurity and , secondly , that they have protection from the disease if it comes into the European Union . #% We know , and others have said , that people escaping from these situations are desperate people escaping conflict , war and circumstances like that . #% I do not know about other areas , but in the North Sea sometimes 50 % and more of the catch of a fishing boat is discarded because it is too small , unmarketable , or whatever . #% However , I am wondering how consistent and truly reliable you will prove . #% I very much regret the attitude of the USA to that conference and the influence of its gun lobby . #% The border disputes between Eritrea and Ethiopia remain unresolved . #% The Genocide Convention to which we and all our allies are parties imposes a duty upon us to punish all acts of genocide ordered by constitutionally-responsible rulers . #% But as far as the scope of the proposal is concerned , I am rather disappointed , if not surprised , at the suggestion that the UK Government , British Labour and Conservative Members sought to exclude private companies whose activities affect the environment . #% -- Mr President , it is absolutely essential that the EU is fully prepared for an influenza pandemic and that we learn the lessons from the past , for example , from the foot-and-mouth crisis in Europe , so that contingency plans are well-known , communication lines are clear and coordination properly planned . #% After Lisbon and Stockholm , we are left in no doubt as to the importance Europe places on developing a knowledge economy . #% So I hope we will support the rapporteur and reject most of the amendments . #% We might disagree over the precise numbers but the Commissioner would agree there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of staff working in this area . #% The reason , for example , that the EU-Russia embellishment process has been stalled , as we know , is that Poland has a reserve over Russia 's refusal to ratify the Energy Charter . #% However , I invite him to share any further thoughts he may have with Parliament on detailed implementation of these undertakings . #% Mr President , we live at a vital juncture of European and international affairs . #% In this context , with the arrival of the President of the United States next month , is it not possible for the Commission , the Council and Parliament to think of three major areas where we could cooperate in the terms we have used in our joint resolution on a Community of action ? #% We are therefore right to call for these documents so that we can see exactly what basis has been used to assess how to ensure the European Union will work for 25 countries and how to ensure that Europe will become more competitive , and indeed meet its international obligations -- the members of the European Council take decisions on our behalf , but very rarely provide us with the requisite budgetary framework . #% Some of our colleagues are seeking to sabotage this careful work by demanding arbitrary and ill-considered decibel reductions . #% A quarter of schools have no water within walking distance . #% The UK Government has still not transposed Mr Florenz 's legislation . #% A friend of mine who is a psychiatrist made the remark that it must be very frustrating for farmers who are denied now , particularly if they are in the pig and poultry area , the opportunity to grow their own food , additional food which they desperately need now that they are unable to have access to bone-meal which has traditionally been part of poultry and pig diets for many years . #% I ask for a reserve of half the money allocated by the Commission for the first year of the funding to be set aside and released only if the private sector signs up to its commitments to take part in this project . #% We have cause for concern in all circumstances where food of animal origin is being packaged and identified . #% rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . - Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for all the hard work which she has put into this report and the close cooperation that we have had on this . #% The simple answer would have been to withdraw Annex XV , but that has not been done , and as long as it remains , then I personally have a real problem with this . #% EU citizens working around Europe - and I have met many - should not be left disadvantaged by having their pension pots frozen in different Member States . #% The European Committee for Standardisation , for example , recently did work on the packaging of waste directive , which the press has described as `` fundamentally flawed , undermines democratic accountability and fails to meet the demands of the directive or , for that matter , environmental protection '' . #% This is now urgent . #% It can be built upon to advance the reputation not only of this House , but also in future negotiations with other third countries . #% We now have a historically low level of inflation and we have price stability . #% We are not yet ready . #% Let us be clear : that it is an objective which we all want to reach . #% Finally , Commissioner , when you deal with WTO rules in your deliberations , I would ask you also to remember that we have enormous duties and responsibilities under the Lomé Convention . #% Surely that is a question the Conference of Presidents could address and deal with fairly . #% I would ask the House to note that whilst we recognise that not all Member States ' legal schemes for such recognition accord equivalent rights and status , the Commission accords equal recognition to all existing national regimes which make provision for stable partnerships . #% Thousands of British holidaymakers travel by car or hire cars every year in France , Spain , Portugal and many other countries in Europe . #% It is absolutely unequivocal in its demand : the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi . #% The old assumption that while the EU and the industrialised countries keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries while developing nations focus on lower-skill sectors , is now open to huge debate . #% It must surely be arguable that a ban would breach the EU directive on equal treatment regardless of race or religion . #% On the issue of Iraq , it is also worth mentioning that the Council for the first time has invited Mr Brok and myself to go to Madrid for the donors ' conference , an extremely generous and welcome offer . #% To date , we have not been very good at any of these . #% My submission is that the hidden agenda and programme for 2007 will include a resurrection of the constitution , that slain vampire , after a small blood transfusion . #% What the lobbying letters from the aviation industry are really saying , putting forward every excuse in the world , is this : ` just do n't touch us , we are somehow special . #% Can we begin to abandon concepts like that , can we perhaps begin to take a more realistic view in the setting of interest rates , a view which would accept that conditions have changed and that we can now begin to hold back on interest rate increases as unemployment falls so as not to choke off a fragile growth ? #% If we as Parliamentarians do not safeguard against illness of our Members , I do not believe we are doing our duty . #% Now we are opting for even tougher laws , I hope . #% However , he is no Saddam Hussein . #% Member States conduct peer review of each other 's anti-terrorism and security measures , but they still have not managed to make all Member States even implement the 2002 framework decision on terrorism -- the very law which makes it obligatory to criminalise terrorism . #% On the one hand , the EU wants to carve out its global role as a diplomatic heavyweight but , on the other hand , the CFSP requires unanimity , which means compromising to preserve the interests of individual Member States , particularly the big ones . #% At a meeting there last week , farmers merely asked that the arable area payments that they are entitled to be made somewhat earlier . #% I call on the Commissioner now to show how he will introduce control and verification mechanisms so that our European money will achieve progress in the peace process , and not be abused by the paramilitaries to undermine our very aims . #% Indeed , calls to allow Member States to equate breaches of EU environmental law with a criminal offence will give a strong and positive signal that the EU is a serious player in the environmental domain . #% The first example is penalties . #% I would particularly to thank him and his officials for trying to see trade unionists from all over the European Union and indeed from the United States of America , who had an opportunity to put their views . #% I would like particularly to invite Mr Byrne to confirm to the House that the provisions of last week 's Communication by President Prodi on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment will be applied in full to the extension of his proposal . #% Some of our Member States have had horror stories to remind them of that . #% For all the fine words in the Commission document , this agreement is creating a human and environmental disaster . #% 
` But , ' I says to them , ` they want to bring that Europe much closer to our citizens , so that 's all right , is n't it ? ' #% The Council will be aware that on 11 April India test-fired a medium - range ballistic missile , the Agni 2 , which has a range of 2 , 000 km and is capable of delivering a nuclear warhead . #% I want to make it clear , here and now , that when coming forward with this proposal both the Council and the Commission should take heed of Parliament 's strong and united position on the issue . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , it is quite desirable to review the trading arrangements that we have with other countries and it is quite understandable that Japan sees the FTA as particularly attractive in relation to the recent Korea FTA . #% I want to make it absolutely clear that this is nothing to do with the military rapid reaction force : this is a financial facility for the Commission to respond to crises very rapidly . #% I think that is in large part due to the comprehensive framework of health and safety laws we have had in place in Europe for over a decade . #% Mr President , although what I have to say is not quite as exciting as what we have just discussed - at first sight , that is - I must say as a former UK immigration minister , that one of the most difficult processes in the immigration system arises when you have to remove a person who has gone through all the legal processes and no longer has a legal right to remain , or has not provided a legal reason to remain in a Member State and has to be returned to the place from whence they came . #% The Group of the European People 's Party will be supporting it in its entirety . #% In other words , we are faced with the prospect that the majority of the initiatives undertaken on the basis of this annual programme next year will actually fall outside the political orientation set in the annual programme altogether . #% The European Council must assess the situation and establish what further measures the EU can take to bring about real change in Burma . #% Do we say that the more you produce of that , the less you can export to us ? #% If we are looking now at the terms of liability and the extent of the financial recompense that may be necessary , it is no longer good enough to say that the hidden defects in a particular product , particularly one derived from foodstuffs or medicines , will necessarily appear within ten years . #% We do not want to open up the wider negotiations , to talk about multilateral negotiations regarding trips and the WTO . #% Today we shall be adopting the same or very similar provisions for ourselves . #% In Parliament it met with unanimous support in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs the first time it was discussed and the first time we debated it here , every single one of the major political groups said that it supported the proposal . #% Our committee has seriously considered how the Foundation can play a significant and valuable role in meeting the vocational training needs of the new democracies in Europe and our proposals are aimed at careful planning and the need for monitoring . #% China must deliver on Deng Xiaoping 's promise of one country , two systems . #% And yet , in this debate , we hear over and over again calls for us to complicate and make more difficult the procedures , programmes and issues the Commission has to deal with . #% What we need to know is the assessed impact on jobs in Europe and the extent to which pollution might simply be exported to low-income countries which can ill afford to cope with it . #% Why be so squeamish about tackling women 's rights ? #% We have to do everything in our power to make sure that this cease-fire lasts . #% In the past I have expressed concern about the nature of EU financing and the adequacy of safeguards to prevent misuse of our funds . #% Both actions are immoral , both are against international law , both demand action by this Parliament and this Union on behalf of Tibet and its people . #% As the House may know , the Commissioner has written a number of books . #% It is therefore natural that we are concerned that the peace process has been running into difficulty , and the McCartney murder highlights one of the reasons for these difficulties . #% It would be a ridiculous claim to make , were they to do so . #% My third and final point is the question of the number of seats in this Parliament for Hungary and the Czech Republic . #% If we had not voted the way we did at second reading , the Commission would not have changed its mind and probably , more importantly , neither would the Council . #% Many young people and young students rely upon temporary work for employment in between term times and they will therefore be as happy as I am at the lack of progress today . #% A key remedy for addressing this very real problem is the effective use of exit strategies as a prerequisite to the awarding of funding . #% Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice . #% The stringency and the strict adherence to the 20 % ceiling of Category 5 appropriations is something which Mr Viola has welcomed and has enforced very strictly in the resolution he puts to us tonight . #% Confidence will only be restored by a rigorous and demonstrable enforcement of animal and public health control measures and I submit that it is time to get this issue back to science and away from political posturing . #% I think the Council would treat us with much greater respect if its timetable actually allowed us to give our position before it took its final decision . #% Not to do so is to risk long-term public contempt . #% However , it is seems to me that the public procurement market is not working satisfactorily in the area of rolling stock . #% Nevertheless , I am sure that , as well as supporting this resolution , this House will join me in praying for the long-suffering people of Colombia and in hoping sincerely that the FARC and the guerrillas will see the folly of their evil ways and that the Colombian Government will achieve a policy of reconciliation without compromising justice or freedom . #% But then the losers of the past struggles , those in the old militias who did not find jobs and others who were disgruntled exposed that dormant ethnic fault line between Loro Monu and Loro Sae , the west and east of East Timor , and tensions between army and police , and so on . #% It is essential not to confuse education with training . #% I also have in mind the need to address health factors which are exacerbated by decisions within the EU . #% We did not vote on any of them , they were accepted by us in our report . #% I have heard directly from industry how much they appreciate not only the fact that the Committee on the Environment 's report provides them with much greater clarity on what will be expected of them , but also precisely this fairer and more effective sharing of responsibility across the different parts of the supply chain which I have just described . #% Last but not least , the committees should have equal time . #% That is why we back the Council proposal to strengthen the review clause to ensure the impact of the directive is monitored regularly . #% No cause , whether it is the separation or autonomy of Chechnya , no injury , even brutal acts by Russian security forces -- nothing justifies the mass murder of children and their mothers . #% Only a peaceful , negotiated settlement can address the legitimate and long-standing concerns of the roadmap process . #% Mr President , concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today 's agenda . #% When will some commentators get it into their heads that flexibility of interpretation , pejoratively termed ` fudge ' , is already , and wisely , built into the existing criteria . #% We have a deprivation of democracy at local level in Britain and that I hope will at least begin to end after 1 May . #% However , there were other serious issues which could be supported and where I could support them , I did . #% The misery continues . #% It covers a whole range of the Union 's activities in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union , the Middle East , the Mediterranean , Africa , Latin America and elsewhere . #% I wanted to ask her to plead with Air France not to switch , as is rumoured , its flight from City Airport to Gatwick - that is if the flight works , because this week it was cancelled . #% Madam President , I rise concerning Rules 7 ( 1 ) , 7 ( 2 ) and 8 ( 4 ) of our Rules of Procedure to ask whether you or your services have received a communication from the British Government informing you that the Conservative Party has asked to change one of three names on its list , which would remove the name of someone elected in the East Midlands region in the European elections last June . #% The fact is that the EU 's Ruritanian takeover of the NATO operation in FYROM will not contribute any additional military assets . #% Why do we not have a parallel formal objective , perhaps the Tampere objective , to make the enlarged European Union the international beacon of human rights , protection of civil liberties and keeping people safe ? #% Is this a risk to our consumers ? #% These are very important issues and I am only sorry that Mr Staes 's report did not receive a larger majority in this House . #% National authorities should now be requested to put core equipment on standby , available for rapid European assistance when needed . #% You have only to see the detail of the decisions being taken in Basle on banks ' capital adequacy to realise that it would be a nonsense to incorporate them into primary legislation . #% We all agree that one of the central pillars of a democracy is a free press and a free and vibrant press is as much a sign of a healthy democracy as is a vibrant parliament . #% There is a problem in the UK , but not confined to the UK . #% Quite clearly international pressure had to be put on Indonesia and many of us have called for the early suspension of World Bank and IMF financial assistance and the suspension of arms exports and military cooperation . #% In particular , measures need to be taken to lift the wholly unfair international embargo on the north , which has been imposed for so long and which has been directly responsible for holding back economic development . #% Protecting the Communities ' financial interests and the fight against fraud #% We also believe it is vital that there is a monitoring and evaluation procedure that will take into account the extent to which the Foundation has achieved the aims and objectives that are set out for it and has carried out the annual and three-year rolling programmes . #% 
This fundamentalist barbaric regime not only subjects its own citizens to terror , abuse and oppression but exports terrorism to North Africa and the Middle East . #% None of the phase-outs and bans proposed by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety is unrealistic , as some would claim , since they all take into consideration exemptions where safety standards require . #% I have also called for a full audit , not because of any doubt about the financial probity , but just as a basic management control system . #% It is not just a matter of energy efficiency , but of financial efficiency . #% For far too many children , clean water , safe food and adequate shelter are still a dream , even for many in the so-called developing world . #% Thus there is still a lot at stake in making sure that we get it right . #% On the day after we voted for the enlargement of the European Union , I am very conscious that this is going to be more difficult as time passes . #% The government has not done that , putting corporate profits before a sustainable environment . #% I do not believe it is responsible for him to abdicate responsibility like this , and he is the UK Member on the joint supervisory body . #% To return to migratory birds , I think hunters have a great opportunity to be used in this situation to keep us informed of the way things are . #% Secondly , I want to say a word about number portability . #% I would like to take inspiration today from a rather lesser personage , Mr Iain Duncan Smith , who yesterday said to the Conservative Party ` unite or die ' . #% Tony Blair is the odds-on favourite with the bookmakers . #% Last month , as Romano Prodi has just said , we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September . #% They do not put the word ` Bordeaux ' on a bottle of wine or a can of wine that has come from a third country . #% So , I say to the Council of Ministers : Keep this programme genuinely under review . #% Our fishing agreements ought to be coherent with our development policy . #% I myself and many in the group therefore support a small amendment to Mr Andria 's report on that point . #% I am also concerned that this formulation of the directive will produce an uneven market opening , leaving the market closed in one Member State and open in the other 14 . #% There are simply not enough African Union troops to be able to control the high level of violence that is taking place , particularly near the Chad border and in the corridor between Tawila and Graida . #% We want you to meet it by such and such a date and if you do we will open negotiations . #% Mr President , I rise in response to the outrageous comments just made by Mr Gollnisch , who implied that David Kelly , and I quote : ` died in suspect circumstances ' , and that Tony Blair lied . #% As the honourable Member will know , it is a regrettable fact that the people of the region face a variety of threats to health from several sources and some of those threats are obviously environmental in origin . #% The UK now has more cases of skin cancer than Australia . #% Mr President , it is now two years since we in this Parliament passed the lift directive which was setting a precedent that legislation for Europe 's single market could and must be used to enable access for disabled people . #% I therefore support this report , which will enable us to hold the required 12 plenary sessions in 11 weeks , thus cutting the cost and environmental impact of our work . #% The background to this is from our point of view continued prevarication on the part of the United States ' administration whose attitude has , in the past , given us insufficient guarantees that they are willing to negotiate seriously through ICAO to find a way out of our difficulties . #% It will be presented - as you , President , have already presented it - as `` nine years '' . #% Can we also have a labelling of country of origin for principal ingredients in processed food , because this is where most of this Thai cooked meat comes in ? #% I therefore find the attitude of these non-EU countries difficult to understand . #% Mr Paasilinna is an old hand but I would like to welcome Mr Brunetta and Mrs Niebler to the secret world , the secret language , of telecommunication junkies . #% He has now demonstrated his incompetence by having no proposals to put before Parliament today . #% One of your answers is to introduce a minimum income . #% We will also be able to act more effectively abroad . #% I hope that the rapid response mechanism of ECHO can be invoked . #% I should just like to say that we believe it is a necessary regulation because it creates legal certainty and because it establishes minimum insurance requirements for liability in respect of passengers , luggage , cargo , mail and third parties . #% It shows how the WTO must become more transparent and legitimate . #% During the time leading up to the Commission decision , considerable public concern was expressed about the safety of genetically-modified products and the new risks to public health and the environment that they might pose . #% I was very interested to hear a colleague arguing for additional support out there , in terms of the Asylum Support Office , but I am afraid I missed the amendments which he tabled on that topic . #% For these reasons I abstained on the report . #% It is absolutely right that we adopt changes to our Rules of Procedure so that we not only conform to the regulation on access to documents but can also begin to be held accountable by the citizens whom we purport to represent . #% If we need to look after less-favoured areas there are ways to do that . #% My understanding from the interpretation was that the incineration of dead animals is not covered by this directive under the terms of Article 2 ( 2 ) . #% By introducing greater certainty in business transactions Europe-wide , small businesses will feel more confident to trade not just across Britain but also right across the European Single Market . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , this review 's 10 principles include helping SMEs to benefit from opportunities of the single market , but the eurozone is collapsing , so how can it provide more opportunities ? #% We all know that there is widespread concern about PVC within our society . #% These should be just the preliminaries to her release and to the release of scores of other National League for Democracy members and organisers , elected Members of Parliament , senior Party officials and students detained following the violent attack on opposition elements on 30 May 2003 . #% I would like to concentrate on my view that poverty eradication in Africa must begin with children and the realisation of children ' s rights . #% But the Council of Ministers meets in secret . #% It is very difficult for anyone to understand what that message was from the Commission , apart from to say that it is good news for ticket touts and bad news for football fans to suggest that people can actually get away with breaking the law providing they are prepared to throw a few coppers towards the European Commission later in the process . #% Some of these reports are alarming and some are worrying and it is not surprising that the public are confused and do not really know what to think . #% This week our First Minister announced proposals for Wales to become a Fair Trade nation . #% I would also point out that any references to high-powered rifles are unnecessary . #% We are all aware that vulnerable groups need protecting , but again existing legislation covers that and therefore there is little point in agreeing on that amendment , even though I am sure my colleagues will disagree with that . #% It seems to me that , as an investor-protection measure , it is better to have these enterprises included within the scope . #% But not all delays are due to air traffic controls . #% So we are all happy on that and let us go forward on that for international agreements . #% It is thanks to you that this type of resilient device will now be available on the market . #% Mr President , so much has been said today , but my hope is that whatever form of compromise we vote on Thursday , it will represent a step forward . #% The procedure Mr Goebbels refers to allows us to do that . #% Nevertheless , the European Union , through the Quartet , must remain committed to lasting peace in the Middle East with a two-state solution whereby a viable , democratic Palestinian State can live in peace and security side by side with Israel within internationally recognised borders . #% In those circumstances , if a credible newspaper and a credible human rights NGO allege that secret war-on-terror jails exist in Eastern Europe , and specifically in Poland and Romania , what do we do ? #% However , it was a slightly better report before the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ` improved it ' . #% There is a right to free television , and free media , not those dominated by a few people with vested interests . #% I am even more appalled at certain politicians who have jumped on the bandwagon , including , I am ashamed to say , the British Conservative Party , which said it supported enlargement , has never raised this issue in the past and then started to dance to the tune of its tabloid masters . #% Mr President , one of my first speeches when I became a Member of this Parliament five years ago was on the first Lisbon Strategy in April 2000 . #% 
This minority too came into line and that is why we are at the point we are today , in optimistic mode . #% However , this document is over-prescriptive in its approach and tries to micromanage all areas of external action including setting up an EU Institute of Gender Equality without recognising the strides made by all EU institutions to make every opportunity available to female staff . #% Research indicates that around 90 % of all aircraft accidents could be survivable . #% The Commission seems to have ignored its own scientific committee on the basis that some Member States are imposing their own ban . #% With Senegal responsible for 8 000 tonnes of imports and Ivory Coast 41 000 tonnes , the ACP believe they can be very seriously affected . #% We have to put our money where our mouths are ! #% In the land of the EU , the only continuing law is that of the unintended consequence . #% The rationale behind the proposal that Member State governments will be able to allow publishers , artificially , to keep up the cost of `` literature '' as opposed to - as I understand it - airport novels , seems to me to be both silly and wrong . #% In the UK it is particularly harmful , harmful to our agriculture for instance . #% It is a problem that can only increase as some Member States merge their tax and social security payment systems , and where people may find that they are paying twice for a service that they can only receive once . #% A number of votes were taken en bloc . #% Already there are moves in arable farming towards integrated crop management , broadly based on organic principles though not completely organic . #% The Commission can accept Amendments 8 , 10 , 11 , 17 , 18 and 19 and which are aimed at ensuring that the arrangements of the scheme are properly implemented , that the measures under consideration do not preclude the adoption of a new permanent early retirement scheme for all of the institutions . #% Let us hope that out of this terrible tragedy something good will come and that the survivors may be allowed to live in peace . #% This is another instance in which the failure of European Union governments to speak with one voice and to implement policies with resolution has given licence to another tyrant - in this case , Mugabe . #% I would have liked to put Mr Titford right on that and other points . #% If ICAO can not do that , we will need to look at differentiation , as the Commissioner has said , in introducing operational restrictions on Chapter 3 at a number of noise-sensitive airports . #% First I shall deal with the substance . #% I hope we can look to the administration to produce a report to Parliament as to what this priority means in practical terms , not necessarily waiting until next year . #% Madam President , this is a compromise amendment which was negotiated among groups and then , of course , examined by the various groups last night . #% In the White Paper on reform and elsewhere , the Commission has made direct commitments to reforms which will further improve rules related to the reporting of suspected wrong-doing . #% I hope it is saying this conspiracy of silence must stop . #% This is why my group has so high a regard for the element of consumer safety . #% I believe though that I should mention two or three of the particular problems of Russia . #% We must ensure that there is proper implementation and enforcement of the European Union acquis . #% This is particularly important . #% On the one hand , considerable freedom for companies to restructure and move but very few rights for the workers involved . #% We will do so and we will support you ; but we need a commitment from the Commission that this is a real attempt to salvage something from this deal . #% We have dwelt , so far , on development relations between what used to be described as the First and Third Worlds . #% If this were the case , it might be a worthy ambition . #% As MEP for East Kent , I represent Dover . #% If these are dangerous , then they should all be banned and warnings would then be unnecessary . #% I was a rapporteur for the last two years on the reports on the implementation and monitoring of Community law . #% This resolution could impede their efforts and the British Conservatives can not therefore support it . #% However , some of the processes involved are still flawed with regard to the selection of Commissioners and there is a greater need for accountability at this level . #% That will ensure that we have the staff to carry out the monitoring process , which is still important right up to accession . #% The social model has not succeeded in Europe and millions of unemployed with low growth and inflexible labour markets personify economic decline . #% An area where British Labour Members take issue with the rapporteur is the way in which the polluter-pays principle is to be applied . #% I have one final question as the Commissioner for the environment is here . #% author . - Mr President , I welcome the opportunity that this oral question gives us to revisit the problems experienced by travellers and the wider aviation industry during last year 's Icelandic volcano crisis . #% And we are suspicious about proposals to impose further codes of conduct on business . #% I thank the Commissioner for that reply with words like ` responsibility ' and ` individual responsibility for certain areas ' . #% Bangladesh is the only south Asian country to have signed the Ottawa Convention banning these weapons . #% But what did you write ? #% I should like to quote her comments to you . #% I am delighted that we have managed to reach agreement without a need for conciliation . #% My group supported these amendments when the focus was on the substance but at this stage it is better to concentrate on the issue of whether the Commission or Council has implementing powers so that we in Parliament state loudly and in unison that our interests lie in backing the Commission . #% There is a growing tide of nationalism in Russia , as we have heard , and growing disenchantment with the perceived failure of Western-inspired reform and values . #% Mr President , this is a technical amendment . #% Social solidarity is not just about altruism : it is about ensuring that our society can function properly and move forward progressively . #% This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the `` dead '' car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process . #% I suspect that most people have n't even thought of it and even if they become aware of this latest over-zealous piece of EU legislation , they will place the dud batteries from their transistor radios in the dustbin . #% The inclusion of emails was badly thought through . #% The interpretation of the draft Treaty will be vital and , if the benefits of new technologies , skills , knowledge and freedoms are to be realised by European citizens , there will have to be a political and administrative willingness to move forward . #% I am afraid that these third-country fisheries deals are the most appalling combination of European commercial greed and bad African government corruption . #% We must also make it very clear to these countries that the fact that they have joined the negotiations does not guarantee accession to the European Union . #% No Council decision on European Parliament voting can be complete without recognition of the Gibraltarians ' rights . #% He is , in fact , the ` Fat Controller ' , creating fat pay packets for fat cats . #% Mr President , when the European Parliament threw out the proposed port services directive two years ago no one believed that the Commission would try to bring it back . #% If we are going to wait until next year or later before we begin to think about these factors , you can see the difficulties that will arise . #% The European Union has already done a lot . #% Many of the solutions are cheap and low-tech . #% One of the principal roles of the presidency will , of course , be to guide very carefully the final phases of economic and monetary union . #% Madam President , we have moved a long way from when the rapporteur brought a report first to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee . #% It is understandable that to these workers , who are still in such vulnerable positions , protectionist measures seem an attractive proposition . #% We now have an Intergovernmental Conference looking at the Treaties again . #% 
As a result , they punch above their weight diplomatically at EU level , whereas America falls woefully short of its potential . #% Surely not another lost decade focusing on the wrong kind of reforms ? #% We are supportive of the notion that comparison between products fosters healthy competition and informs consumers of what they can most effectively buy . #% This belief that yet more legislation will improve things is wrong every time . #% The European Parliament is a new parliament . #% That would mean that Mr Davies and I , if we are spared and have managed to survive foot-and-mouth , BSE and everything else that seems to be afflicting the United Kingdom , will be able to make sure that we move to a directive if we feel that the recommendation is getting us nowhere . #% I am not convinced that the British scheme provides the basis for long-term development . #% We should beware , however , of imposing justice on other states , especially if such proceedings might unravel a political truce or accommodation that has brought peace or stability to the region and promises a better future . #% There is aid going in but we need to coordinate it . #% His amendment to extend the transition period by a fixed period namely , from five to seven years - eight in very exceptional circumstances - from the original reference date , should concentrate the minds of both producers making applications and officials processing those applications to ensure that they do meet that deadline . #% It is clear that what we need is sustainable positions across the globe whether it is in the United States , Europe , Japan or indeed in the developing world . #% And what about the VAT and GNP-based own resources ? #% She very modestly says that this was straightforward . #% I would also like to thank the Portuguese presidency for its skilful handling of this very complex dossier - an example of Europeans working together to solve common problems . #% In particular , Islamist terrorists in the region have shown a determination to exploit poverty and inadequate governance to radicalise the people and spread their message of hatred . #% Mr President , these are indeed challenging times for the European Union 's textile and clothing industry . #% We would hope that undertaking would be given . #% On 1 August this year when the Commission lifted its ban , 12 out of 14 Member States to which Britain could export lifted their bans . #% Above all , this project is of practical importance for the internal market , both consumers and businesses alike . #% Foot and mouth disease inflicted a heavy toll in my own East of England constituency , and I had hoped that this European Parliament report would do justice to the losses suffered by farmers , the tourist industry and our whole community . #% There is a new law coming to the Turkish Parliament in the year 2000 , put forward by academics , in which for the first time ever the proposed criminal justice bill does not contain the death penalty . #% In other words , I am asking for a menu of options . #% The prosperity of our Continent depends upon the level of education offered to our citizens . #% The Commission must answer the question properly to give at least a chance to those who have suffered at the hands of Lloyd 's in this sad affair the opportunity to be able to pursue their cases . #% We feel that it should be up to individual states to decide who is expelled from their territory and under what circumstances . #% They may end up with quieter tyres that are expensive , that wear out quickly and that allow cars to slide off the road and crash into trees ! #% Will he support Romania in the final stretch of what has been a major endurance test , leading to early entry in January 2007 , and for Bulgaria too ? #% Compromise , yes , but not a compromise which demands increasing environmental goals from the developing countries without offering them trade and economic gains at the same time . #% A soldier who very sadly was killed while on active service , had a stable partnership and a child from that partnership , but was not actually covered in the UK situation . #% What would then happen is that the European Union would claim to have reduced its pollution , reduced its emissions , but at a cost : firstly European jobs would be lost and secondly the world would not have reduced its pollution levels by one iota : the pollution would simply have been exported . #% As is so often the case , it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem , which will only serve to create more jobs for officials , and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money . #% Our opinions are the same on many things but when it comes to international fisheries agreements we often differ just a little . #% But we must make sure that when the evidence comes forward tomorrow and when we hear the result , if there is no new scientific evidence - and I doubt there will be - that action is taken against France immediately if it does not lift the ban . #% If you look at the references it transpires that the so-called plot is nothing more than the old Interreg regions -- the regional cooperation between different regions with similar problems , such as the Atlantic regions . #% I know the Vice-President is personally committed to the whole notion of openness and transparency . #% Ghana also challenged the European Union last week , saying that the Union talks about opening borders and about bringing down barriers , but is clearly protectionist and unfair . #% Our motive must be serious action against terrorism , not just seizing an opportunity to extend EU competencies . #% We now have clear proof of the desperation entering the thought processes of the federalists in this Parliament . #% There were four areas . #% The consequences for food security , especially in developing countries and for the livelihoods of poor farmers , would be huge . #% What do the ordinary electors in Yorkshire or in Brentwood in the United Kingdom think ? #% The EU is not monitoring these elections for the purpose of rubber-stamping the process : we are there to ensure that it is a free and fair election . #% Mr President , we welcome the debate this afternoon . #% And we in the ECR will continue to fight for our vision of the European Union , a vision in tune with the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of Europe . #% We spend something like 60 % of what the Americans spend on defence , but we spend 400 % of what the Americans spend on what might be called ` soft intervention ' - humanitarian aid and assistance . #% This investment particularly needs to go towards education , training and life-long learning . #% I want , though , to bring this right back home . #% However , high minimum standards are also urgently needed in parallel . #% In political terms , we now need to examine whether the EU and its Member States have the necessary instruments to pursue the truth about what is happening on our territory and in our name and the appropriate safeguards to protect our citizens and residents . #% In the UK we have a traditional saying ` necessity is the mother of invention ' and here we have the EU , mother of inefficiency , providing no necessity but forcing a new invention . #% This shows the change of Parliament was cosmetic - a charade . #% Fourteen out of the fifteen delegations within the Socialist Group want rid of the UK rebate and they will vote for those paragraphs which refer to it . #% When Mrs Thatcher claimed that there is no such thing as society , just individuals , she crystallized this philosophy . #% I do not know what happened to the spirit that led the EU to support the International Criminal Court , when it came to being honest about collusion in torture flights and secret prisons . #% Women are literally silenced by ignorance , fear and stigma . #% You can not find out how votes went in the Council . #% The point is that the issues raised here are a matter for national private civil law . #% While the Chief Executive , Tung Chee-hwa was somewhat dubious in his response , President Jiang Zemin was very clear in condemning any influence in Hong Kong affairs . #% I would have preferred stronger emphasis on substitution . #% That was a key element in the success of those negotiations . #% There is much talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% We have heard less about the hospitals and schools being destroyed and of torture by Sri Lankan government troops . #% What is perhaps less customary is the fact that I actually mean it when I congratulate the rapporteur on his work . #% You talked about the fact that it was a lie to believe that the nation state could exist in the 21st-century globalised world . #% He knew , as does Mr Paasilinna , that these proposals are not just about technology , they are about how technology can address the needs of citizens and consumers . #% This of course would mean a competitive disadvantage for other countries in the European Union . #% 
Lifelong learning has to be meaningful , not just a slogan . #% As far as the code of administrative behaviour is concerned , the principles of that code are already set down in the Staff Regulations . #% If the Lisbon Strategy is to mean more than just words , Parliament is right to expect a significant increase in funding for this area . #% It goes to the heart of the cultural diversity that we prize in Europe . #% By way of general conclusion , we in the Legal Affairs Committee regard the quality of drafting and simplification of legislation as an important remit . #% I wish that was a universal characteristic , but I find that some people writing in the press , for instance , have a confidence and an assertiveness in what they write , which is in inverse proportion to the amount of knowledge that they have . #% If , at the end of the day that is amended significantly , at least that now is on the record and I would hope that the services can take cognizance of what has been said there and can act upon it . #% If they did n't see it as a benefit , would they just not pay the contributions - after all , no one really knows she is helping her husband - and is this not what married people do , help each other ? #% Later this month the Committee on Budgets will have a conciliation meeting with the Council on a variety of issues and one of those issues will be to get an across-the-board agreement on those areas where we have codecision . #% In the UK , for sure , there are still some doubt whether you can actually prove the vaccination of a ferret sufficiently to be certain that it could be vaccinated and then be safely transferred as a pet from one country to another . #% Do we really want today to set such an extraordinary precedent ? #% There is an issue that was raised with me by a number of assistants who were refused entry to the public gallery even though there was space . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of a legislative proposal guaranteeing enhanced and extended paternity/maternity pay in Parliament today . #% Let us now look forward instead of looking back . #% What exactly is the European Armament Agency going to do ? #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , it is true that President Chávez 's economic and social policies are posing a big challenge to powerful interests and there may well be , as Mr Catania maintains , a campaign to delegitimise his government . #% We had a temporary committee which met for ten months to discuss an issue that could have been discussed within the existing committees . #% That will offer us a key potential for unlocking world trade . #% It seems that it was agricultural subsidies in the EU that yet again broke one of the deals on the table . #% Thirdly , in terms of the food safety agency - I noted that was raised in the European Council in Ghent - I would remind the President-in-Office ( instead of laughing , he might listen to parliamentarians when they are speaking ) that Parliament 's position is that the money will stay in reserve until we are satisfied about the operations and the location of this agency . #% Amendments to the common position threaten the future of some of these stations and the jobs of the miners who supply the coal . #% Another case is the reference to the condemnation of the security fence built by Israel , which has dramatically reduced the number of Palestinian suicide bombers who cross into Israel to kill innocent Israelis . #% We made no agreements on that and , as far as we are concerned , we stick by Article 39 of the Interinstitutional Agreement . #% The major point I wish to make tonight , linked to the amendments I made to Mrs McCarthy 's report , which were accepted by the committee , is that better regulation is a process . #% I would like to hear from Mr Byrne today , using this small example initially , whether he has got to the bottom of this problem . #% What an impact it would have made on our public opinion , as well as on the disaster effort , if it had been , for example , a French aircraft carrier with German helicopters and British marines assisting in Aceh in Indonesia , and not just American ones . #% This is underlined by the paragraphs on sustainable energy sources and amplified by a number of amendments which we in the ALDE Group will be supporting . #% While there have undoubtedly been many areas of disappointment , three months ago there was a very dramatic political development in Bulgaria . #% I also wish to thank the Commission for the important facilitating role it has played in reaching what I hope will be an agreed set of amendments when they are voted on Wednesday , and to thank the Greek Presidency - and before that the Danish Presidency - for the preparation of this particular dossier . #% Thank you President-in-Office . #% Clearly we also need a European defence identity but we should remember that the fifteen Member States spend two-thirds of what the Americans spend on equipment and yet we have a fraction of the equipment they use . #% Consumers are worried about getting involved in transactions because they are worried about the security of their payments . #% Instead , we need to match China 's exports to Europe with our own to China . #% As I have already said , in the interests of greater transparency the Commission is now publishing its decisions to send letters of formal notice , to issue reasoned opinions , to refer cases to the Court or to close or withdraw cases immediately a decision has been taken . #% If neither the Commission nor the Member State can get their act together , they should be returned to where they belong - the pockets of the European taxpayer . #% Charities like the Home Farm Trust -- which supports 900 people with learning disabilities and has shops in Braintree , Colchester , Newmarket , Saffron Walden and Sudbury in my own constituency -- can not recover huge sums of money as they do not charge VAT , and provide their services heavily subsidised or for free . #% But I believe that in voting for this report we are not saying that the conventions have to be changed but that there is room for an in-depth evaluation . #% At a time when the effectiveness of the Commission is being called into question I should like to commend the very fast and efficient response which ECHO made to the crisis in Central America . #% Is it ignorance ? #% It is also important that we push this legislation forward so that the consumers can have a product which they know is perfectly safe , is reared in an environmentally-friendly manner and which they can eat with total safety , knowing that the animal has had an excellent life . #% They call for fines . #% Both those factions have sent delegations to see him , and this is a very great problem indeed . #% We are saying that Serbia 's stabilisation and association agreement can not be progressed while Mladić stays hidden , since it shows lack of control over the security services . #% This is an indication that there are issues which need to be looked at . #% The approach has changed because it has failed and the transit reservations we have are extremely serious , as shown in paragraph 4 of Mr Elles ' excellent report and paragraph 15 of the explanatory memorandum . #% We want to see them too , but quite frankly , the sooner we get the SAB voted at our second reading , on the assumption that the Council does not agree with our first reading , then the changes will come about . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , under Rule 53 , I would like to ask the Commission to respond and tell us whether it intends to adopt all of Parliament 's amendments as adopted today . #% Just remember what that means . #% You will see that we are basically satisfied that this framework of Staff Regulations will deliver the core parts of the reform : the move to a personnel system where members of staff in all the European institutions will be properly compensated , will be able to exploit their talents and encouraged to progress their careers in a system that rewards their efforts . #% However , I question why the CITES conference is to be held in Bangkok . #% I would appreciate the Commissioner 's comments on the Commission 's intentions about a European regulatory authority and how he sees the interlinking between a proposed European regulatory body and national regulatory bodies . #% We all have a stake in the kind of food that is circulated in Europe , how it is produced , how it is prepared and ultimately how it is checked . #% Is the EU about bridges or barriers ? #% We want to get at the truth . #% Now , that is harmonisation I would go along with . #% It would be a much better option than full membership on current terms . #% We must support their civil society and their NGOs and we need a very special and generously funded visitors ' programme in the European Union to bring students , journalists and members of civil society -- the movers and shakers and the opinion formers -- over to our Parliament to see how democracy really works in action . #% Other innovations in this convention including Article 4 on payments , Article 8 on visibility of the Community ' s contribution , Article 9 on arbitration and Article 12 on entry into force , all aim at enhancing transparency and accountability . #% To achieve that , at the end of the day we also need a far more regional fishing policy within Europe rather than the unified sort of system that we are trying to impose at the present moment . #% Ford has announced that it is going to make the next generation Ford Mondeo at Genk and our job is to ensure that we have a demand for that car . #% I would like to thank Mr Battilocchio for the opinion he gave on behalf of the Committee on Development . #% It is not just the European Union that has been damaged by the conflict in Iraq and by the outfall of that conflict ; Nato and the United Nations have also been seriously damaged . #% Some of us are dealing at the moment with the case in which not only is someone being returned to Iran , but his British Christian wife is going with him , with the government paying her fare . #% According to a report in the Financial Times on 22 May , Europol apparently thinks that these measures are still inadequate . #% But I would remind Mr Titford that even taking the amount of money that he referred to , it is less than 0.01 % of the overall budget . #% Yet the inclusion of white asbestos in this directive is estimated by none other than our own Trade Union Council to cost GBP 80 billion for the UK alone and up to GBP 500 billion throughout Europe , without possibly saving a single life . #% 
We look forward to the establishment of an EU-China strategic partnership and we certainly support the need for the abolition of the death penalty -- something we urge in all countries , including Japan , the Republic of Korea and the United States . #% You have to allow the full group meeting in the week before the plenary session so that groups can make decisions as to how they will vote . #% Will there be criminal sanctions ? #% Mr President , as coordinator for the PPE-DE Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I wish to pay special tribute to our rapporteur , Mr Zappalà , for piloting this very complex legislation safely through to a final conclusion . #% If the international community is serious about tackling the appalling conditions in Zimbabwe , then the United Nations Security Council should urgently investigate the situation in that country . #% This debate is about support for workers who are coming together to own and work together in their enterprise for better ends . #% And now we see that things have gone a stage further , when a sectoral council suddenly wakes up after months of negotiations and discussions on these very subjects and after the Convention has finished and halfway through the IGC wants to wade in and rewrite the draft Constitution . #% I want to pay tribute to the British , American and other armed forces engaged in Iraq and express my condolences to those families of our servicemen that have suffered loss . #% The largest part of additional human resources spending is therefore not related to any significant extent to the design and implementation of the reform strategy . #% It now appears that this committee itself practises discrimination on the grounds of age , in that it is impossible to apply for a job there unless you are younger than 45 . #% Mr President , Mrs Gebhardt began by saying that Europe is an area in which people feel secure . #% author . - Mr President , there are over one million preventable needle-stick injuries on healthcare workers each year across the whole of the EU . #% That , again , is a total contradiction of what a regulation that has a financial and a legal basis is meant to be doing . #% The EU must redouble efforts now to resolve outstanding issues in Moldova and give it the appropriate financial assistance it requires , but this will not happen by naively resetting relations with the Kremlin . #% If you look at the European figures from the MCDDA , offences in the EU have doubled since 1991 and quadrupled in some countries such as France , Greece and Spain . #% Markets and jobs have been lost and consumers are the losers , whether as a result of the import blockade or the inability to recover their deposits . #% It is pretty obvious from the discussions I have heard over the last two days that the Members ' Statute will be an ongoing discussion for the next few weeks , if not the next few months . #% This is not , as some have tried to claim , an issue affecting only a few people ; it goes to the heart of the European Union 's commitment to respect the Convention on Human Rights , to its own Treaties and to the rule of law . #% All of these measures are necessary , but the main focus of the Commission 's proposals and therefore of my report is on emissions trading . #% I was criticised for that view and accused of bias . #% Is it possible that some kind of asymmetric process , with the US base parts registering in Europe but not vice versa , may occur ? #% Now Mrs Cresson was not actually correct in saying that it was the smaller clubs in this competition ; certainly clubs like Manchester United , Liverpool , Tottenham , Leeds and so on are in the competition . #% I agree that President Musharraf took over in a coup . #% Instead , the Presidency produced a couple of discussion papers written by academics and even these were not discussed . #% The emerging , widespread evidence of apparent mistreatment of Iraqi detainees by UK and US troops demands examination at the highest level , including at the forthcoming summit and in independent inquiries . #% I , for my part , would like to thank all those in Parliament 's conciliation delegation who participated . #% Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it is ; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important . #% I hope your assurance that it will enter into force before the end of the year proves correct . #% I agreed with the Council to clarify the wording - there have been no other changes . #% I have always championed Ukraine as a modern European country that is entitled , in due course , under Article 49 of the Treaty , to apply for EU membership . #% In today 's global economy the EU is never going to be able to compete on price alone and nor should it . #% During the recent debate on the Coveney human rights report , I tried to strike a balance between the stick of Uzbekistan-bashing and the carrot of more dialogue with the Uzbek President if he continues to cooperate with fighting international terrorism and delivers on his commitment to give independence to the judiciary , freedom to the press and punishment to those responsible for torture and human rights abuses . #% The fact that the President-in-Office sat for 4 1/2 hours at our last meeting showed his commitment . #% Would I be correct , Commissioner , in summing up your thorough answer in one word , `` no '' , i.e. the Commission is not going to do anything ? #% However much more valuable shark fins are than the rest of the body , it is absolutely right that the whole of the body should be landed and used . #% Now is the time for the EU to stand up and be counted . #% What they tend to forget is the brutal , inhumane and destructive way in which reform was managed during the Thatcher years in Britain . #% I think it would be a very good idea for the Commission to focus on setting up some regional connections so that we can learn from each other about how we cope with this , because it clearly is not going to go away . #% The third area I want to concentrate on - and it is what other speakers have mentioned - relates to junior doctors . #% The Commission 's financial facility should not be mixed up with these defence issues . #% So , demand for change exists from both patients and potential healers . #% At the Lisbon Summit it appeared that the EU had rediscovered a commitment to enterprise . #% For that reason , in order to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest , I shall not participate in the vote on this report . #% I hope that we can now ensure that these projects are implemented across the EU and play their part in ensuring the maritime sector reaches its full potential . #% This report is not about who you should accept as a refugee , and I remind Mr Schmitt of that , but about how you decide which claims are valid . #% It would be another useful area for comparison in an open method of coordination . #% Often , however , we legislate for all the right reasons in the European Parliament yet we have not heard the worries of the ACP , because we have not listened . #% I would invite my colleagues , for instance , to see and visit , as I have , the Viridor site near Kingsteignton in the south-west and then come back and say to me with any real confidence that they think there are no environmental or health effects . #% Joint investigation teams , on which I had the honour of being rapporteur in the previous Parliament , have been working well in this area , as referred to in the Díez González report . #% On 6 July 2002 a very famous world sporting event will start . #% Perhaps some sort of compromise should be found between the Commission playing a lead role and the CEPT playing the lead role in terms of being the spokespersons , simply because some Member States may not yet be in a position to adopt that . #% Given what we learned in the BSE scandal and given what we now know about the dangers that may linger for many years in primary products , it is surely right that the Commission bring forward this proposal and that we seek to improve it as best we can . #% The five questions put down were answered . #% You are thereby showing complete contempt for this Parliament , since it is precisely what it has asked for . #% The EU dictates that one size fits all and , judging by the identical wording of these group questions , one size does appear to fit all . #% We have seen the European Commission move from not talking to the North Koreans to having an ECHO representative in Pyongyang and we have now moved from five Member States with diplomatic relations to , I understand , thirteen in the process of establishing diplomatic relations with the DPRK . #% I would have voted against the report had I been there . #% Clearly the Internet world is going to be highly suitable for the Commission to set that up . #% So if our generation is sincere in seeking the freedom of political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi , tackling the despicable trade in women and children for sexual exploitation and bringing the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Darfur and in the Balkans to justice , we have to defend the concept of human rights at home as well as abroad . #% Equally , I applaud her recommendations to improve and facilitate cooperation between investigative and prosecuting bodies of the Member States , and that every Member State should recognise the principle of previous convictions . #% However , fuller employment will not come about through bureaucratic plans and schemes such as Lisbon , which the rapporteur and others seem to think will help and which is now discredited , surely : halfway through its time span and less than half implemented . #% We no longer say post-Lomé , we now say Lomé V and we very much welcome that change of vocabulary . #% In the Caribbean , tourism is a key driver of the economy , but that is not the case across sub-Saharan Africa where , with a few exceptions , tourism is not such a big factor . #% Clearly , in every country there is a percentage of criminals who do not abide by laws and regulations . #% As far as Europe is concerned , on my advice , they took their case to the Ombudsman because we believed that EUROSTAT , by refusing to define the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region , was treating the island unfairly . #% But there are those few lines which still give us concern , and I would seek help from the Commission to give us an assurance that those areas will not be left untouched - that the money will be utilised . #% 
If such a complex system can be set up on the basis of that clause in the Treaty , there is absolutely nothing to prevent the Council from setting up a different system - the one which we are advocating - that gives the Council and Parliament equal rights to call back and equal rights to scrutinise . #% There is much to be done if both sides can get together . #% European legislation plays an increasing role in setting tighter standards and curbing pollution . #% As we informed Parliament on 15 May , this allows the Commission to discuss human rights issues with Vietnam , for example in joint Commission meetings held under the agreement . #% My Amendment No 114 would enable Member States to ban them , and I urge colleagues to vote for it . #% This is not 'til ting at windmills ' , as Commissioner Byrne put it . #% So , legally , the 1991 UN Settlement Plan remains in place . #% We must try to shape it positively . #% I would like to share some facts with the House this evening . #% China is our second largest trading partner , but the EU does not share the same fundamental values with it as we do with India . #% It is just as wrong to execute Saddam Hussein and Timothy McVeigh , the Oklahoma Bomber , as Ken Sara-Wiwo , the Nigerian human rights activist , or the hundreds of victims of Saddam Hussein 's brutal , totalitarian regime . #% The European Parliament 's committees - even the non-legislative committees - must apply the principle of transparency and at present the standard of transparency is not uniform from one committee to another . #% But that of course covers just about all companies except multinationals . #% I am a very experienced and active member of the Committee on Petitions . #% It represents a substantial technical achievement and the many officials involved deserve our thanks and our appreciation . #% The report points out a number of ways in which a revised directive could make works councils more effective and prevent some of the problems and breakdowns we have heard about : regular meetings , not the token annual meeting that is all 85 % of them manage ; increasing the representation of women , who are virtually invisible in many of these bodies , just as they are in too many boardrooms ; training to improve the quality of representation and communication ; and the facilities and safeguards to ensure that works council members represent all sectors effectively . #% Some implementing measures are discretionary , not obligatory . #% We wonder whether the Member States have got their responsibilities quite right in this respect . #% We urge the Liberal Group to dissociate themselves from their links with the EPP over the amendments because it has shown itself to have racist instincts in its party . #% General Motors will still take a share of the profits and Saab Spyker will be obliged to buy fully assembled cars from another General Motors plant , one located in that well-known European nation of Mexico . #% This is a real achievement , led by the UK Conservatives . #% To take another example , port state control . #% Nepal is indeed in a delicate position , geopolitically and geographically speaking , but it should seek inspiration from its democratic neighbour to the south , India , rather than from the repressive dictatorship which exists to its north , namely the PRC . #% I wonder what other measures , in concert with his colleague Mrs Barbara Roche and Commissioner Papoutsis , he is proposing to help ensure that the single market is properly completed ? #% We have no judgement of what we define as a common difficulty , a common challenge , and we have no idea of a common approach . #% I hope that in our future dealings with this region that will no longer be a feature . #% That is a reality . #% Mr President , you asked that this Parliament should enjoy a greater commitment from its membership . #% British customs services tried to stop British citizens using their rights to go to France to buy the fine wines for which that country is rightly renowned . #% Without truth , there can be no reconciliation . #% It is a difficult subject . #% But I do not believe that religion should be part of this . #% After 9/11 in the United States , the Americans discovered there was a lack of cooperation between the FBI and the CIA . #% We clearly have an imbalance within the European Union . #% It is in our interest to make sure that we get the answers and our legislation right , but also to get them through quickly . #% The UN norms on business and human rights form the best basis from which to develop a set of global standards for the human rights responsibilities of transnational corporations and we must support them . #% A lot of Members had to leave yesterday at 6 p.m. when voting should have finished . #% One of the effects of Customs Union is to encourage the business community and greater entrepreneurial activity . #% In a few years there will come a time when new EU Member States will be crying out for third-country nationals to come to help them with their economies and to fill employment vacancies . #% The head of the Belgian Police Federation has said that he is concerned . #% It was also due to the determination of the Commission to recognise that all three institutions needed a cultural change . #% However , our law enforcement agencies are only national or local and they can not cross our internal frontiers . #% Here most of the items our group wanted were included in the final version of the paragraph , except that there is a reserve against the whole amount . #% We also need to increase food and medical supplies to the Iraqi people by extending the oil-for-food programme . #% The more outrageous , shocking , unexpected and attention-grabbing an attack is , the greater its success . #% However , at the heart of the Chinese economic phenomenon lies an unresolved contradiction : China 's new-found prosperity is based on capitalist principles applied by the Chinese Communist Party , which is the only political party in China . #% Can you wonder why more and more folk want nothing to do with the EU when it destroys their livelihoods ? #% Firstly , the rather modest compromise resolution drafted by an all-party group which , if I were a member of the forces serving currently in Afghanistan - and I think particularly of the British forces - would give me very scant comfort . #% I feel that it excludes other parties from the outset . #% It is just not good enough in my view to argue that FTAs will eventually stimulate economic growth . #% This may well become more important in the future as social security systems become very stretched and strained because of government financial restrictions . #% This is only one small step in the massive challenge we face in fighting cross-border organised crime , given the open borders we have in Europe which criminals utilise and cross so easily . #% The report , which analyses the Commission 's evaluation report , is primarily concerned with the Internet and with video games , as it was felt important not to anticipate a possible future review of the Television without Frontiers directive . #% It strikes me that Canute had more sense than Europe 's rulers have today . #% The call for ratification of the ILO conventions in applicant countries as well as third parties is a desirable concrete means by which to ensure that the ILO is taken seriously . #% We are not the farmers ' committee and we have a duty to look beyond personal vested interests and towards the interests of all those citizens living in rural areas who will not find jobs in agriculture . #% Mention has already been made of the asylum issue . #% The British Foreign Secretary said that she will try to overturn decisions on opening up Council meetings to public scrutiny . #% I have to confess I relied upon my daughter to help me find out just what would happen if you type in ` porn ' . #% Mr President , all over the world work is being done to resolve long-standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal enmities and hatreds . #% The failure to tackle this problem really is not good enough . #% Over the last two years we have all become very much more aware of the need to ensure that anything entering the human food chain via animal feed is carefully controlled and presents no dangers , either to human or animal health . #% I would like to ask the President to insist that Council respond to the concerns of Parliament and take seriously the need for effective action against the Mugabe regime . #% Richard Howitt MEP claimed in a press release that I had directly accused the Turkish Prime Minister of supporting militant Islamist groups , following the atrocious bombing in Turkey last week . #% You will see centralised economic planning and control and , above all , what you will see is the desire to impose a political union upon the peoples of Europe without their consent . #% Whilst that may make them feel more comfortable in the short term , it does not help them in their employment prospects in the long term . #% 
They ask us to vote for Article 4 and for a sensible version of Article 11 . #% Thirdly , there is nothing on strengthening the role of the regions within the political system of the Union and , fourthly and finally , we would have appreciated some critical self-assessment of the functioning and performance of the European Council itself . #% They need to be addressed concisely and quickly . #% So why is this Parliament again indulging in pointless activity by writing , debating and voting on this report ? #% The report puts forward a series of ideas and ways of assisting young farmers starting up or carrying on in their businesses . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank our chair , Paolo Costa , not only for producing this report but also for his work as chair of the committee over the past parliamentary period . #% Did we the institutions get it right ? #% We must limit the amount of waste generated before recycling . #% It is likely that in the United Kingdom this year we will produce a record number of cars . #% We must not impose a system that increases the costs for the general taxpayer , particularly in this era of fiscal consolidation . #% I would like to congratulate Mrs Sornoza on doing this report so well . #% As Members entered this Chamber this morning some form of demonstration was taking place outside , with people who had labels attached to their clothing advising us to vote in a particular way . #% It was recognised then that we have different traditions and needs . #% In a sense , many of those rights become nationalised rather than considered from a Community perspective . #% In the context of the earlier debate on ending the death penalty , it is very relevant that we should call upon the Russian authorities to respect our views , the views of Europe , as to whether he should be indicted and what the sanction should be . #% We have research which shows that health workers working outside hospitals are more likely to be dissatisfied with the response of employers . #% However , there is an urgent need for additional non-agricultural jobs and small-scale enterprises in rural areas . #% Secondly , the text of the rapporteur 's report refers to tax havens and raises that question in relation to Amendment No 5 . #% Neither is Russia particularly pleased with the role played by the independent Baltic republics with their enhanced status in foreign affairs as full EU members . #% Have any enquiries been made of Member States as to whether or not European youth voluntary service could be regarded as an alternative for those young men and those young women who have a genuine conscientious objection to military service ? #% Let us hurry up and get this sorted out . #% Last but not least , our most important role is to make sure we have greater accountability and more democracy and that it is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning for Parliament 's rights in the European institutions . #% Both of these committees come into very close contact with the individual European citizen . #% My Group fully supports the change in the regulation 's legal basis to Article 175 . #% The Government of Tajikistan has rejected extremism and , with the help of the international community , is seeking now to consolidate its nation 's democracy . #% We need exceptions and the problem of using nonylphenol ethoxylate as a co-formulant in pesticides is one that we addressed . #% The United States of America has recently taken the lead in openly encouraging the establishment of democracy in the Arabian Peninsula . #% Whatever prevention strategies are put in place and however much is invested , it is unrealistic to think that these disasters can be eliminated . #% But the ghost of Christmas past for Mr Blair will be the spectre of failure . #% I want to point out that the same pre-emptive deadline has been fixed for today on the draft agreement with the United States on the air passenger data transfers -- the so-called PNR agreement . #% Thirdly , unemployment is now our top priority ; it was not back in 1991 . #% The Legal Affairs Committee approved the proposal and had no comment to make on it . #% The basis of Mrs Thors ' report will encourage this growth . #% This crisis was avoidable : for many years my party has argued for a more flexible Europe . #% Congratulations to you for supporting that . #% They tell me that all EU-funded development projects have had to be halted because of the emergency in the Middle East . #% As others have pointed out , while some of our Member States do have considerable geographical pressures on them from the flows which arrive , many of the over-burdened countries are actually not in the European Union at all but are elsewhere . #% Duties are quick fixes which only hurt those EU industries that have actually adapted to the global economy . #% Many colleagues have pointed out that the sums agreed are less than what had initially been proposed by the Commission . #% As a dramatic statement , that is in line with the best editions of Irish literature ; as a statement of fact , it is entirely untrue . #% But , if we slacken deadlines , if we loosen the agenda , if we are laborious , it will be thought we are either not serious or not efficient . #% However , I would say to this Parliament that , as the vice-president of the joint parliamentary committee with Slovakia , I met yesterday senior safety officials from Slovakia and the Slovak Electricity Authority . #% After all , all she did was to say something in the Kurdish language within her Parliament . #% I also regret the removal of extraordinary circumstances in the delay section , but welcome the exemption of rotor operators , the levels of compensation agreed and the inclusion of the low-cost carriers . #% I also accept some of the assertions by Mr Garriga Polledo about the damage that floating exchange rates can do . #% A third of the world 's population was represented there and they were asking Mr Blair for a trade deal . #% Half of Europe is queuing up to join the EU and yet 48 % of present citizens wonder whether it is a good thing . #% In the UK alone it is estimated that the cost of this regulation and the working time directive together will be over GBP 1 billion , and that is not my figure , it is the industry 's . #% There is no room for complacency . #% That is why I am delighted that we have widened this resolution , even though we were unable to change the title ; I would not like us to think that we are linking any country or organisation with these attacks . #% Would he agree with me that the closure of the smaller abattoirs in the UK has perhaps led to the spread of the disease ? #% My own country -- the United Kingdom -- is going to place an order for 120 million doses . #% Clearly , there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China . #% The implementation of Lisbon will no doubt see attempts to use it as a tool to apply the Schengen acquis across all the Member States , including those currently exempted , which includes the United Kingdom . #% We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection . #% I endorse the presidency 's congratulations to the Turkish armed forces , which took over the organisation and command of ISAF from the United Kingdom last June . #% I rely on the new negotiators , whoever they may be , to make sure we get that point across . #% I hope so too because on 20 July , at the last conciliation , we agreed virtually nothing . #% The European Union Member States are the chosen destination of comparatively few , compared with the world 's poor countries such as those in Africa . #% That is something that we have added in at this stage because it seemed to us that it was all very well having some common provisions but unless we have a way of monitoring those and making sure that those evolve with the rest of the range of services involved , then things might just stand still . #% Well , if abstinence can work in sexual relationships , of course it will . #% I am glad to say that we have prevailed and that a definition has been included in Article 2 . #% However , the people in those two countries both endure the most tyrannical military juntas and suffer systematic abuses of human rights . #% We must also recognise that enlargement will bring additional and quite legitimate demands in terms of information . #% What the Commissioner has just said amounts to insisting on the word ` possibly ' remaining in the text . #% Here in Europe we should be aiming to set these higher standards subject to the available technology . #% 
The observers will clearly be learning the way that we work , which may be rather complicated , but I also believe that we should learn from Romania 's history . #% We have already had the novel foods regulation , but this is another part of the jigsaw . #% Therefore , we do not want to do anything to further escalate the tensions in this region . #% We are delighted that some candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe will benefit as well . #% We should take note of that lesson and ensure that when this is voted in plenary in February we have a much-simplified voting list . #% We do take a neutral policy position between Israel , the Palestinians and other Arab and Muslim countries . #% We call on the Council and Commission to use all political and diplomatic means to encourage the Haitian authorities , opposition parties and civil society to facilitate this dialogue . #% You are here as observers , so just have a look around . #% I think that is an absolutely shocking proposition , given that Britain is a nation of horse-lovers and given the particular cultural values which British people attach to horses and ponies . #% I would remind the Commissioner and the Council that this Parliament showed its resolve in the conciliation with SOCRATES . #% The danger is that there will be pressure for the EU to become the organisation of first resort when next there is a crisis to be dealt with and that NATO would increasingly be relegated to a purely residual role as a collective defence organisation . #% It took forward Bulgaria 's application for European Union membership and put Bulgaria in a position formally to open accession negotiations in February 2000 . #% We must support this blacklist of unsafe airlines . #% I urge the Commissioner and his services to be extraordinarily imaginative and to recognise that Europe 's citizens feel the same revulsion about cat and dog fur as they feel about imports of seal products . #% After all the struggles , delays and financial and legal barriers placed in our way by those who did not see the significance of this issue , we are now on a fairly firm footing and I hope we can begin to address this very serious issue . #% Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague , Mrs Flautre , who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill . #% Even civil servants at national and local government level in Britain are not allowed to get involved in electioneering as the Commissioners are doing . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by wishing the Prime Minister well as he embarks on his work . #% I am afraid that having read Kathleen Van Brempt 's report , I think she has lost touch with the realities of modern agriculture . #% Taiwan enjoys an exceptionally high standard of human rights in east Asia and can serve as an example to China of what societies can achieve when they take the bold decision to become truly free . #% We therefore urge the Commissioner to revise the EU strategy of defending , by all means , its FMD-free status , and to recognise that the culling and destruction of healthy animals is both inhumane and ineffective . #% If we want to engage young people in the European Union project then we have to make sure that we are offering something to them . #% It seems to me that the endless addition of further languages to the cocktail of the EU 's official languages is not necessarily of benefit to the efficient working of the institutions . #% Is it burdensome ? #% I believe the pillar structure of the EU provides us with the best opportunity for a framework within which industry can operate . #% The Info-Points do not depend on us for survival . #% I also want to be positive , because I know that ten new Commissioners will be coming into your midst as of May 2004 . #% I am sure the Commissioner is aware of these . #% As a result , you will inevitably get smaller crowds , you will get less television revenue , you will get less sponsorship and as a result of all that there will be an increased financial burden on the smaller clubs . #% The final decision is one for the Bureau of this Parliament . #% I welcome Mr Mantovani 's report and the Commission communication . #% Others - the realists - want tough action and opt for isolation of the regime and sanctions . #% I highlight the fact that the British Canoe Union is begging us not to support the extension of this directive to recreational waters . #% That means that not only DG Sanco , but also DG Justice and DG Internal Market should be fully involved in the process . #% We also managed to get into the recommendation the idea that the reports on inspection must be publicly available within two months of their completion and submission to the Commission . #% These problems are outrageous in the context of global wealth in the 21st century . #% Sitting here on an evening like this , I think we all belong to Parliament 's survivors ' network . #% There are a lot of safeguards that the Commission has put in here that the Council has carefully discussed and I very much hope that we will fully support the Council common position on this matter . #% These issues are already being addressed by the Alliance as part of the defence capabilities initiative . #% I feel this report goes a long way to promoting better cooperation between regions in different Member States , which will only have a positive effect in achieving the aims of cohesion policy across the EU and ensuring that all European Union regions develop harmoniously . #% However , I would like to make a strong plea for the urgent installation of a powerful extractor fan in the toilet to avoid the embarrassment of what might happen if a visiting guest to one ' s office avails himself of the toilet shortly after the member has used it ( this problem also exists incidentally in the Brussels office toilets ) !! #% Why can we not have access to these documents ? #% The classical function of the Commission would be to broker an agreement between the warring partners in a crisis . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office to consider raising in the Council the issue of whether this anomaly can be removed at an early stage . #% As regards compensatory payments , the rapporteur does not detail how the money would be spent . #% But we need to see whether its new government is able to fulfil its commitments . #% I wish to say , on behalf of this House , that when a Member asks a perfectly legitimate question I expect that question to be answered to the fullest extent . #% That is the sort of thing we must guard against . #% Let us hope that we can get this concluded well before December . #% In the past , this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment . #% As a British Labour Member I very much welcome the approach of my Conservative colleagues , who are now endorsing Gordon Brown 's proposals . #% Future expansion will be out of the question and I can not believe that is what the British Conservative Party really believes in . #% And here this principle inevitably means scrutiny , scrutiny and scrutiny . #% Mr President , I quote from a recent article in the British Press : ` Britain 's booming wine industry will be scuppered by EU regulations that want to prohibit growers in Britain , all of them unsubsidised , from planting any more vines if their sales continue to soar ' . #% I am not sure about it being exquisite : this is not a word usually associated with me , but I will accept it . #% First of all Mr Harbour ' s questions , which typically were perceptive and constructive , related to how far we thought that the commitment to the development of managerial skills and culture was being achieved . #% Sadly , the only real long-term solution to this problem lies in the revision of the financial perspective in 2006 . #% That seems rather a long way off . #% Very briefly , the information note from the European Court of Auditors says on page 7 that the adaptations and validations necessary to ensure the full implementation of the new accounting framework have been delayed . #% I would just appreciate some frank exchanges and honesty between you and those of us who are interested , because Mrs Andreasen told you what was happening . #% I therefore invite Mr Dupuis to withdraw all his amendments except the two . #% We must also remove asylum and immigration from the clutches of interior and public order ministers , because those ministers are preoccupied with internal security and repression . #% I would compare the presidency of the European Union with the British Grand National , or the Derby . #% These are all political decisions , political choices that are highlighted by political parties ; they are often hidden away in the Council . #% That is an important objective . #% I hope colleagues will support the amendment , which would help make up the communication deficit . #% 
Mr President , I raised the following matter on the Friday of the last part-session . #% The key test of a currency is price stability within the economy , not the value of the currency against other currencies outside the economy . #% I urge that we carry on now , understanding all the difficulties that you have mentioned . #% But it is difficult for any of us to reconcile Turkey 's call for guerrillas to come down from the mountains with the fact that other members of the same community who have chosen the path of democracy are then shown lined up in handcuffs and marched into jail . #% The European Union needs to use the latest technology available to meet these needs . #% I hope that the High Representative - who is not here today - will raise this episode with China and also with Nepal , whose own nascent democracy is kept afloat partly by EU taxpayers ' money in the form of financial aid . #% To execute him at this stage would be to frustrate the search for truth and justice and serve the interests and ideology of the very people implicated in the crime . #% I will end as I began , by saying that Bangladesh is a country with a future . #% Thirdly , it underlines the importance of engaging civil society and building parliamentary links . #% I would like to say yes , by all means let us plant more trees but let us at least have some concrete idea as to whether in the future there will be a market for the wood produced . #% The second dilemma is also touched on in Mr van Velzen 's report - although not directly highlighted in his contribution . #% First , in relation to the European Union 's own services , one imagines that those operating on our behalf in south-east Asia are mainly from the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin : our team of European Union health and food inspectors . #% It always seems to me to come as a complete surprise to politicians how countries get in debt . #% The reality is that that the accounts will still be about as watertight as a colander . #% It is ` straight banana ' time again ! #% I believe we have a great opportunity to shape our future policies together and respond effectively to the demands of European citizens . #% Why should such people choose to come here and settle for a number of years if they are to be seen as suspect or second-class , here on sufferance only and viewed as another dimension of a disposable society ? #% This disease did not just affect farmers , it affected hotels and tourism ; it affected butchers and traders across Europe . #% I accept that you had already spoken about it with officials in the Seychelles and they were very understanding , but this again was nine months after the agreement was due to come into force . #% Nevertheless , I support the High Representative 's role as an intergovernmental envoy and do not want these vital areas made Community-based . #% We came out as soon as the bell rang for a vote . #% Minimum standards on donation and compensation based on a not-for-profit system are essential . #% Madam President , on Wednesday 's draft agenda there is a joint debate on the Middle East at 3 p.m. . #% No-one has informed me about it but I am sure that will happen in the course of the evening and I will then tell Mr Tannock . #% Secondly , I am delighted that we have now effective proposals , which I am sure the Commissioner will accept for the quarantining of animals which come from third countries where rabies is endemic - the Indian subcontinent would be a case in point . #% The Bilbao agency has succeeded in encouraging the process of spreading best practice effectively . #% How often is a blind eye turned to wrongdoing ? #% There are procedures that can monitor , check and , weed out some of the worst , and we have to hope that our sons and daughters are not so bright that they can be ahead of the industry . #% In 2001 , Europe began to take steps to make sure that it was prepared . #% Let us be frank about this : as the Commission impact assessment states , only six Member States currently have a national system of collecting small batteries for recycling -- Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , Holland and Sweden . #% We need democratic solutions to this . #% But we too can - and should - make a contribution , because the bankers , brokers , cleaners , IT technicians , investment advisers , lawyers and caterers who spill off our trains into city centres in Frankfurt , Paris , London and Brussels are just the same as those 5000 or 6000 people who turned up for work in New York one day and will never ever come home . #% And you wonder why the EU is held in such contempt ! #% We come from the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom , a region that has historically been very dependent on the car industry , which has been through many cycles of plant closures and change . #% It will take time for the effects of these improvements to be felt by large sections of the population , particularly in the regions outside of Sofia , but we can expect the upswing to gather pace as accession approaches and confidence in Bulgaria 's political and economic transformation grows . #% That is my theme . #% I do not believe those who accuse the EU of unconsciously subsidising the occupation , but Israel should be forced to pay more than one piece of compensation to the European Union for this unjustified destruction . #% Equally , do we put women off staying at home with children because we as a society value this less than the workplace ? #% Time and again , the Commission comes to this House and claims that this is just a technical matter , that it is just about the internal market . #% Perhaps I am just a bit cynical in suggesting that it is too easy for ministers to agree tough targets which are not legally binding . #% At present , it really does not work ! #% Last week on the streets of Palestine we heard the clamour for choice and change . #% Does the Council intend to respect fully the decision of the Ombudsman whereby , if I understand it correctly , all Council documents have to be made available to the public and not just some ? #% It is , obviously , only able to highlight those areas where EU action has been particularly significant during the reporting period . #% Alternatively , can I ask a supplementary question to Mr Newton Dunn 's question ? #% That being said , what has the process now led to in what we voted for ? #% All 4 000 pigs were then exported from the Netherlands to Belgium . #% So now is not the time to stop . #% A pity , because it means we are to continue with many of the restrictive practices in the name of harmonisation , while all the time that which you fear - globalisation - is stealing up on you . #% I believe that the Commission 's answer to this is that the 1 % level is the only level at which we can be absolutely sure that the testing methods are available so that they can be firmly based in Community law . #% The training notices must have a substantial impact as well as training itself . #% You also mentioned that this is a first reading . #% Today I am asking the Commission to study the results obtained by the Lashing@sea project and to come forward with proposals to improve container lashing procedures and equipment . #% Despite good and serious proposals being put on the table some considerable time ago by the UK , they have not yet been agreed or seriously considered . #% My group supports the regulation , not only because of its technical and financial value to Turkey , but also for the political message it sends . #% And bearing in mind that on 28 October the Commission adopted their new personnel strategy , can we please have an early debate in this House with Mr Kinnock about his reforms and with the presidency about their reforms , so that Members can be properly informed . #% We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism , both to local economies and as a factor of European integration . #% I also wish to draw attention to Amendment No 38 from the ELDR , which would make access to sex offenders ' registers subject to data protection rules . #% That really is to allow Member States to overcome one or two technical difficulties they might have in ratifying ILO Convention 180 and thereby allowing the whole package to be brought into effect at the same time . #% We have 30 years of resolutions and 30 years of failure . #% The success or otherwise of a law depends on the nature of its enforcement , and the skill/experience of enforcement officers , which can not be addressed by this directive . #% I am therefore asking for the Commission to explain , firstly , how it intends to ensure that Member States make good on their commitments to the educational goals in the 2020 strategy by ensuring that this area receives sufficient support and funding and is not forgotten amid the rush to balance the books in the light of the economic crisis and , secondly , how it intends to secure extra budgetary means for these important EU-level strategies and programmes . #% My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver . #% You do not have to be Hayek to know that can not be done . #% I welcome Mrs Kinnock ' s recommendation that we do not see this agreement as a model for ACP countries . #% At the end of 2004 , for all neglected diseases , we had just 18 R [ amp ] D projects in clinical development and a further 42 on the way . #% 
I agree , however , with the Commission and not the rapporteur on Amendments Nos 7 , 8 , and 9 . #% I know it is appreciated by all my colleagues . #% The whole field of information and communications technology is vital to our lifestyle and economy . #% We must deal with it on a practical and political basis , but with frankness and determination . #% Even the humanitarian effort in Darfur is now under threat , because access to the humanitarian agencies is being obstructed . #% Is it poor procedures ? #% We will have to look again at this to see if we can find a form of words that will cover our many traditions and needs . #% This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment . #% More than seven out of ten of those working longer hours said they would not want fewer hours if it meant less pay . #% That challenge to internationalise the process , to look outside the traditional borders of it , is something that the collective societies as we know are facing up to , but we need to provide them with the right framework and encouragement to do that . #% Inevitably horrific practices will continue to occur . #% The demanders , the governments , should pay , not the individual citizen . #% The chemical and biological conventions could also be strengthened . #% Alongside this is a request to hold simultaneous ratification , which could present serious problems in many Member States . #% I am delighted that the UK is taking a lead in delivering its share of the EUR 2 billion annual aid for trade budget promised by EU Member States at Gleneagles by 2010 . #% In any labelling regime there are bound to be imperfections . #% But the overall thrust of the report is very good . #% Recent events have shown that citizens are becoming increasingly frustrated with the inability of politicians to deal with the effects of globalisation and other aspects of corporate life . #% Clearly this is yet another reason why a large section of the British electorate reject membership of the EU and backed our campaign for withdrawal . #% The Times I can buy in London for 35p - I apologise for its headline about banning Labour MEPs - costs 400 % more when I buy it in France . #% Yes , there must be new precautions and to some extent new safety measures . #% Otherwise we shall find we are short of majorities on a number of votes where people legitimately have interests . #% In New Zealand , farmers screamed when their subsidies were abolished . #% I will certainly give you full details of this later but it is such a serious matter that I thought it should be raised in the House now . #% To suggest a date after 2013 is to suggest that an old parliament will be committing a new parliament after 2014 ; it does not work . #% Everywhere we must work for the liberation of prisoners of conscience , the outlawing of torture and the ill-treatment of prisoners and an end to the barbaric institution of capital punishment , which should be seen to be utterly unacceptable in the world and the civilisation of today . #% I wish that the anti-nuclear people on these committees would realise that this constant sniping at the applicant countries on this issue is not doing our relations with them any good at all . #% Although I come from Scotland , I know these issues are of concern not just to my Liberal Democrat colleagues from other parts of the United Kingdom but also to ELDR members representing regions across the whole of the European Union . #% Whilst the report of the committee set up by the European Parliament makes some important recommendations on how to improve the handling of any future outbreaks of foot and mouth disease , some MEPs are using the ` wisdom of hindsight ' to launch wholly unjustified attacks on the UK Government . #% Our society , our citizens , have a huge stake in the success and health of our large corporations . #% I think that some people have a fairly naive understanding of democracy and the way things work . #% At the end of the day enlargement is a political question , it is a question of political will by political leaders . #% Nevertheless , we can not continue in the long term to ship goods thousands of kilometres around the globe , with virtually identical goods travelling in the opposite direction , without ensuring the full costs are covered . #% We remain supportive of attempts to develop lifelong learning strategies and to promote vocational education and training ( VET ) and the better integration of key competences such as foreign language learning , mathematics and science . #% Surely the Court judgment on the US PNR agreement has shown that Directive 95/46/EC can not be the legal basis for data used for security purposes ? #% However , there are important areas where the compromise agreed in the ECON committee has greatly improved the Commission 's proposal . #% That need not be the case . #% Mr Barón Crespo is right that we did not want it . #% Mr President , I am sorry to raise this yet again , but it appears that no one in Parliament 's Presidency is listening . #% The Rules do not require us to register such an interest before voting . #% With regard to passengers , I would urge caution . #% This tragedy perfectly illustrates the need to have effective European-wide legislation to protect our citizens travelling between Member States . #% Madam President , I would like to welcome the vote on the subject of paedophilia . #% If we did this throughout the EU it would go a long way towards reducing CO2 emissions and would be a very positive benefit to our environment . #% The recent Washington Summit and the future Cologne Council have further focused attention on how we can promote human rights and secure peace in Europe in the next millennium . #% Mr President , Uzbekistan is the most populated and culturally the richest of the five central Asian post-Soviet newly independent states . #% It is an unusual meeting , taking place on the eve of an Israeli election , and following the election in Palestine on 25 January . #% While I am very grateful for the interest , concern and assistance shown in this matter by the Turkish ambassador to the EU , Mr Oguz Demiralp , I would welcome the support of the President of Parliament in sending a letter to the Turkish judicial authorities seeking assurances that the legal proceedings will go ahead with no further delay . #% Similarly , we are also not in favour of extending the scope of the export ban . #% I do not regard noise from airports as a transboundary issue and I am pleased that the committee rejected a number of the amendments which were tabled . #% I know it is very difficult for people to understand this , but I hope that the Commissioner will follow it through and keep that legislation in place . #% After all , that was one of the areas of consensus across the Parliament - we may have disagreed on certain elements , but we agreed on more and more transparency . #% But the other side of the coin is that if we were to have another small European programme where too great a proportion is spent on administration assessment and the very people it seeks to help are put off participating by the lack of cost effectiveness in making bids or building networks , many voluntary organizations could not spare the time or resources to prepare those proposals and would simply opt out . #% We have codecision powers but we have the threat from the Council that if we do not fall into line then they will abandon the whole legislation . #% For these reasons we have abstained on those amendments seeking to advance the compliance date beyond 2008 . #% Secondly , we thought it was very important that a mission statement should be established that set out clearly the aims and objectives of the Foundation . #% We therefore accept the need to tighten up the wording of Article 6 ( 4 ) , to clarify its role and to restrict it to truly on-demand interactive services . #% According to the European Commission 's own Scientific Veterinary Committee , the battery cage system has - and my colleague Clive Needle just referred to this - ' inherent severe disadvantages for the welfare of hens ' . #% Our regulation should make reference to this and require the Commission to work with the Member States , within the international institutions , to reduce these . #% I am all for the free market and can support any proposal that is market-orientated . #% The refugees were returning , reconstruction was beginning to take place . #% Mr Kristoffersen has mentioned Ignalina . #% In fact it nearly did fall at the first parliamentary hurdle and for that reason I congratulate our rapporteur and our shadow rapporteurs who worked with the Commission officials to improve the original proposal . #% I am delighted that twenty-six of the propositions that went to conciliation have been accepted , particularly given the rather lamentable history and the two years ' delay in the previous Parliament when this issue was locked up in the Council . #% Mrs Paulsen mentioned labelling . #% They are treated as illegal immigrants and deported , and , in many cases , are retrafficked . #% 
Mr President , I welcome Mr Barnier ' s commitment to go to the regions , both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say . #% It is important because psychiatric and neurological conditions cause 28 % of lives with disability . #% The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan is forbidden to open an office and distribute its magazine . #% This report , as we have been told , arose from a petition signed by 1.9 million people EU-wide , which led the Committee on Petitions to produce its report . #% Is the Commissioner aware that 93 % of Romanian people are against inter-country adoption as a solution for abandoned children in Romania , as is the Romanian Government , and that the Romanian Orthodox Church to which 89 % of Romanian citizens belong , wholly opposes such a practice ? #% Parliament should not be constrained by the fact that former senior Communist Party members from Eastern Europe currently sit on the Commission . #% It has been a success : it delivers positive outcomes ; it has practical effects both for SMEs and others trying to make the internal market work . #% The Stability Pact includes mechanisms designed to operate in recession and Article 2.1 on the excessive deficit procedure could be used in exceptional circumstances to justify higher military or security spending . #% Madam President , I also commend the rapporteur , who has approached this complicated and important brief with great conviction and enthusiasm . #% But surely we should agree that where a country decides to liberalise what we may consider to be a service of general economic interest , we have no right to tell them not to liberalise their markets . #% It is not about punishing wrongdoers but apportioning and allocating responsibility for environmental damage . #% Another proposal has been a joint interparliamentary body between national parliaments and Members of this Parliament . #% The Commission nevertheless takes appointment decisions independently and solely in the interests of the institution . #% Will the Commissioner therefore finally confirm his unequivocal support for this directive and his willingness to work with us in Parliament for its speedy and smooth transition ? #% Article 130u of Title XVII obliges the EU to ensure coherence between development policies pursued and the fishing agreements . #% One particular point of concern to my group is security . #% I believe we must be vigilant and ensure strong , effective measures are put in place to protect the rights of children in e-Europe . #% I am sure that will continue . #% I am grateful to Commissioner Lamy for his answer , as far as it went . #% What also needs to be stressed is that there are special technological reasons why a concentration of ownership , the potential abuse of a dominant position , is so serious . #% It can be seen in the phenomenal growth in the stock markets of Europe in the value of dot.com companies and just recently in the major changes in the composition of the FTSE 100 index in London . #% Mr President , President Barroso 's quotation from Montesquieu prompted me to search the annual policy strategy for a clue as to what the Commission proposes to do with the Constitution . #% Could the Commissioner say what instructions have been given to the team of inspectors regarding monitoring duties when cattle arrive in third countries ? #% Does the Commission appreciate that buying a random collection of football matches is not what 90 % of people want ? #% You can not talk of working with General Bashir and hoping that in the future we can persuade him . #% On the same basis , net contributors like Germany , Sweden and the Netherlands , should also have a rebate . #% The Arctic also presents itself as a unique opportunity for multinational cooperation . #% Firstly I note the reference in the question to EUR 600 million as ' a cost reform ' and I must say that the House is in danger of accidentally misleading itself . #% This directive will have a direct impact on the lives of many constituents of mine in Yorkshire , people from ethnic minorities and many thousands of people across Europe . #% Certainly , my report would answer some of the problems that you raised . #% Failure to do so will only sanction the very illegal activity we have condemned , and it seems to me that some of the contributions today are attacks on UN resolution 1441 which we are all supporting . #% We also have questions about the entry ban , and Article 9 makes clear it should be the general rule for anybody who is returned involuntarily . #% For this reason consumer protection matters at least as much . #% For example , this Parliament is extremely supportive - and quite rightly so - of the Petersberg Tasks . #% I would therefore respectfully ask you to move on to the next item of business and defer this until we have a proper voting list . #% I feel particularly strongly that the government of Afghanistan should grant a moratorium on the use of Sharia law in areas such as the stoning to death of women and the amputation of limbs , in order to show how a modern Islamic country respects international covenants and treaty obligations and promotes justice without cruelty or abuse of human rights . #% I went up to one woman and although we could not speak each other ' s languages we stood there and hugged each other . #% Meeting the target of universal primary education looks extremely difficult . #% That is one of the reasons we have kept our continuing interests . #% But the Horn of Africa stands out as the one region where we have not been able to grapple with conflict management and prevention . #% I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr von Wogau , our rapporteur , and commend this report to the House . #% That is why we must remind ourselves of the appalling attack in Baghdad on the UN mission , express our deep condolences to the families of those who have been killed and injured and note the appalling , tragic and untimely death of Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello , an outstanding human rights defender . #% I believe the way forward is to reduce the supply and then try to increase demand to get the industry back on its feet . #% Second , it is clear that trade deals can no longer be secretly stitched up between the more powerful WTO members . #% In other words , there are now eight EU Member States , not four , around the Baltic Sea , not all of which see the Northern Dimension in the same light . #% If we wanted to cut back we would need to look at fossil fuels , fertilisers and the metallurgical industries . #% However , he is detained under an extradition agreement between Spain and Morocco under which Spain and Morocco have agreed not to extradite their own nationals . #% That is the area we should be concentrating on in the development of the Customs Union ; encouraging more entrepreneurial activity , more activity with the business community , more activity with the free and democratic trade unions . #% Some of its ideas are plain rubbish but there are also plenty of destructive , anti-Semitic conspiracy theories . #% Mrs Palacio , who is just leaving , has said that human rights are needed in a public place and at the core . #% The problem of BSE , for example , is still with us : cases of it have been notified in two previously clear Member States this week . #% Human rights is an essential element in the EU 's relationship with Tunisia , as set out in the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement , which came into force on 1 March 1998 , and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan which came into force on 4 July this year . #% Ending the VAT exemption would further level the playing field , and bring fiscal as well as environmental benefits . #% Mr President , Commissioner , it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate . #% I think that we should be very careful not to hold up the benefits . #% The best response to the terrorists is criminal convictions . #% This Tampere motion is , I believe , part of that message . #% Tonight we face our next test in addressing the buses and coaches directive and addressing too an issue which is most campaigned about amongst Europe 's 35 million disabled people - the right to accessible public transport . #% One is Mr Samland , the previous Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , who left Parliament at the end of the last mandate . #% Businesses , particularly small and medium-sized businesses , are worried about the vulnerability of their enterprises to fraud and fraudulent transactions . #% The safest approach is to turn off these plants at the millennium , but how does Lithuania turn off 75 % of its generation capacity from Ignalia ? #% To do so , as our motion suggests , it must face up to the causes of disunity and confront those of evil intent . #% If we do it with a lot of stars , people will say it is only propaganda . #% I am , however , most deeply anxious that the Commission should monitor the situation and we should not hesitate to speak out . #% President-in-Office , the justice minister of Afghanistan recently announced that the new interim government would maintain the Sharia law sanctions of stoning women to death for adultery and of limb amputation for theft . #% So we will not be obstructing it . #% 
I want to pick up on what is a central point for me : we are , as my colleague Lord Inglewood said , trying to reflect a new world in which we want small businesses to take advantage of the most powerful , international marketing tool that they have ever been offered . #% The Commission has entered a reservation against this decision . #% Let us take it further , if we can , by extending it more into the area of consumers , and not just that of administrative problems . #% We are now at a point where we see the limits to competence and to the geographical expansion of the Union being reached . #% Perhaps we were wrong to talk in the resolution only of the LTTE and the government , when there are plenty of other organisations . #% It is vital that every possible step should be taken to devote attention to the prevention of new human rights abuses and to resist the covering-up of those which occurred in the past by means of general amnesties and the like . #% In any other context , other than this polite gathering , I would say that it deliberately misled : in plain English , it lied , and there was a process of deliberate deceit of the institutions that led Parliament to the Holzfuss report . #% To mention the common agricultural policy , we have set-aside land on which we are growing nothing . #% Next week we have a very prestigious meeting in Brussels where we anticipate between 800 and 1 , 000 unemployed people attending our Parliament in Brussels . #% Mr Duff took a difficult report on a subject that was triggered by a particular case of high controversy and which remains a particular case of high controversy and where my side of the House still differs substantially in its views from many of those on the other side of the House . #% Surely the reason we have so many of these counterfeit brands is because the genuine brands are prevented from being sold at the price that consumers want to buy . #% We had the President of Hungary here this morning , which shows that clearly politicians from the candidate countries are looking forward to joining this Parliament and they need training to be able to do that properly . #% It symbolised to me and my colleagues in the European Parliament the fact that the flag state controls had failed . #% One would hope it can be rectified . #% We respect the international role they have played in the fight against global terrorism . #% Our priorities in this enlarged Europe must be to have more and better jobs : not to talk , but to . #% This , I am sure , is incorrect . #% Our children must never again suffer such terrible afflictions and we must do all we can to prevent this . #% For that matter , it does not go as far as some of the pioneers in this area , in some of the NGOs , would like , like Tony Bunyan of Statewatch . #% Despite costly recovery measures , all we have managed to avoid so far is a complete collapse of the system . #% It is euro-based : it has the euro without being in the eurozone , believe it or not . #% That is quite a lot to take on . #% The holders of the presidency should be setting the human rights standard for the world , yet only this month the Council of Europe 's own Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed that here we have a government which is prepared to suspend the human rights of its own citizens under Article 5 of the European Charter . #% However , there have been concerns , and the helpful letter from Commissioner Piebalgs does not entirely answer these . #% For instance , Latvia is suffering a deep economic crisis and it has faced severe budget cuts in the country 's 34 higher education institutions with a threatened 50 % cutback to the higher-education budget . #% I do not believe that helps public enlightenment . #% It is also the location of a frozen conflict in its breakaway territory of Transnistria , under Russian military protection since 1991 , following a bloody secessionist conflict . #% That is an innovation and I welcome it . #% It may well be that the structures we set up after the second world war are not suitable for dealing with the post-September 11 world . #% Moreover , the promotion of a system of `` European preference '' for national defence purchases in paragraph 24 is a short-sighted idea that would do further damage to Europe 's ailing militaries . #% However , we also believe our committee has improved the text by bringing it closer to reality and by clarifying certain aspects of it . #% Madam President , Saddam Hussein has inflicted vast suffering on huge numbers of people . #% I just want to dwell on one or two key aspects that will help us realise that goal of turning rhetoric into reality . #% The main challenge after the war must be to bind the countries of Europe together in a structure that develops their common interests and makes war impossible . ' #% Mr President , the PSE Group , the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group have consistently called for a committee of inquiry . #% Last July I asked when the Commission foresaw the expected legislative proposal for a permanent sovereign debt crisis management mechanism and what would be the legal base . #% I must stress that these remarks are made with no consideration of nationality or political persuasion or membership of clubs or secret societies but because over the years - and I could list them if there was more time - this House has been let down by poor administration in DG VI and Mr Jean Feidt should carry that responsibility . #% If they travelled a little way to the Cairngorm Mountains and the Abernethy Forest Reserve , they would see one of Europe 's Natura 2000 sites , covering 13 000 hectares of ancient Caledonian pinewood , moorland , lochs and mountains , which is the habitat for rare species such as the capercaillie and the black grouse . #% On the age limit , it is sometimes very difficult to tell the age of a young person , but there seems to be a consensus that 18 is a fair compromise . #% It needs the whole force of the Commission and the Member States to bring this about . #% With regard to whaling , I make no apologies for it . #% That was not a big issue for the United States and not a big issue in terms of trade , but it was very important . #% So I support what Mr Garosci has done , I entirely agree with the points made by Mr Miller and indeed somewhat exceptionally too , with the points made by Mr Metten . #% The UK is therefore in apparent breach of EU law . #% That is why we must educate and prevent , why we must test and deter and why we must do both these things together . #% What did you actually do ? ' #% I met with 50 tribal leaders , upwards of 20 000 Marsh Arabs , and I reviewed and inspected extensively hospitals and primary health clinics in Basra , Al-Amara and other smaller towns and villages . #% However , I would also ask the Commission to look much more closely at some of its assumptions about the winners and losers from the globalisation process . #% Finally , the committee may request that the President appears following each significant monetary action . #% Those of us who have had the chance to talk privately to Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy and other people who may find themselves on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank have always said that it is essential that the European Central Bank does not simply act as a collection of bookkeepers but that it acts very much as an institution of the European Union acting on behalf of its citizens . #% Thank you Commissioner for that very comprehensive and helpful answer . #% On Malta , like everybody else I welcome the decision by the Maltese Government to apply for European Union membership . #% I hope also that it will send out a very clear signal about our determination , both to the United States and to Russia - particularly to Russia - whose ratification of the Protocol is so important . #% Yet when the Danes voted against the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992 , when the Irish voted against the Treaty of Nice in 2000 , they were told to go away and try again . #% It is for that reason that I welcome the draft UN Resolution , which addresses the immediate needs of the Iraqi people . #% There are obviously differences of opinion in this House on intellectual property rights . #% The fact that we have a vote of confidence on the Commission as a whole and that its term of office coincides with that of Parliament was brought in through the Maastricht Treaties and enhanced with the Amsterdam Treaty . #% So , could you ensure that unreasonable pressure from manufacturers does not distort positions to be taken at the internal market Council on 25 November ? #% Bulgaria 's financial provisions are fixed from 2007 to 2009 in the Accession Treaty , Title III , which was signed on 25 April this year . #% The Algerian Government must of course recognise that it can not underestimate the immense importance of upholding democratic values and human rights if it is not to alienate those who oppose fundamentalism but believe in freedom and democracy . #% General debates are all very well on broad priorities , but we have that several times a year when the Commission presents its programme , when each Presidency presents its programme , and we tend to have that sort of debate surrounding each European Council meeting as well . #% Indeed , since the beginning of this year , there has been some encouraging news with the recovery in industrial output , mainly as the result of import substitution , relatively tight controls on inflation and a stronger balance of payments position , produced mainly by a sharp rise in the price of Russia ' s oil exports . #% However , due to certain references in this report , particularly with regard to the Working Time Directive , we have chosen to abstain . #% From Estonia we have Mr Kallas , who for 20 years was a Soviet Party apparatchik until his newly acquired taste for capitalism got him into trouble . #% It is misleading to give the impression that the EU and the European Parliament endorse the level of democracy and human rights in Kazakhstan , Armenia and Azerbaijan . #% Through you I urge the Commission and the Council to reach decisions and take urgent action following the meeting on 14 October . #% 
Too many of them have told me of the difficulties associated with this scheme . #% Moreover , the ACP-EU Joint Assembly should be consulted should there ever be a situation when Article 5 is invoked in the suspension of countries under consideration . #% I know that many there will welcome these new instruments as opening the way for a fresh boost to the social economy and employment through transnational developments . #% It is up to us to listen to some of the problems that people express to us . #% Today , two and a half years on , Amnesty claims that the international community and the Afghan administration have been unable to protect the rights of women . #% Clearly , this Parliament , as a legislature , as a budgetary authority and as an employer , will rightly have close interest in all of these developments . #% The last time I debated with Mr Patten on this subject in committee he accused me of having an overdose of testosterone . #% That is the core of the system architecture , but alongside that there are other public policy areas where we want to do research . #% It breaks down into three different areas , two are related and will be touched on later , and the other is the Committee of the Regions . #% It is a bit of an old-fashioned survival , I would respectfully suggest . #% Mr President , the Secchi report on the single market shows us how far we have come , but also how far we have got to go in achieving a truly efficient single market working for Europe 's citizens . #% Several amendments will probably be on offer to align this text with that of Article 55 ( 1 ) , in the utilities directive , as it now stands following the adoption of an amendment by Mr Karlsson in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement this afternoon on the programme of work being undertaken by the Commission for improving safety in civil nuclear installations in Central and Eastern Europe . #% It is therefore sensible for Parliament , whilst accepting the improved document 's intentions , to reimpose our priorities from the first readings but to organise and also clarify the suggestions emanating from this text . #% Vaccination , in my opinion , has to be one of the options that the inquiry can recommend if they so find . #% Is there to be a regular process of dialogue in which they will be involved ? #% But let us concentrate on getting good legislation , and not fall victim to those who want to campaign against the PRC by proxy . #% I will cut through all the jargon and tell you precisely what they are talking about : brainwashing ! #% Given that the EU countries and Japan face common challenges , I think it is important that we look at some of these issues and address them through trade agreements . #% In my own 35 years in the funeral profession , I never encountered the problems of not being able to send home or receive mortal remains . #% We want an end to no-go areas for people with disabilities . #% It is clearly a very generous package , but at the same time it has to be a powerful package because otherwise it will not work . #% They have highlighted - as will I - the importance of this industry a major employer of this industrial research base . #% Its attitude on this issue could be a precedent for other cases . #% The Microsoft case is particularly difficult because it includes interoperability in a highly technical field . #% However , I will get clarification from the Commissioner personally . #% In that sense the Court of Auditors ' report is an important one and one which brings together four institutions : the Court is making the accusations , the Commission has to defend itself , the Council of Ministers who are also criticized in their individual capacities or in the capacities of their Member States , have to give us advice and Parliament has to decide . #% Will the Christian Democrats support these fundamental rights if they are described as fundamental duties ? - because they are duties as well as rights . #% Could you launch an investigation into this matter to establish that Mr Hannan did not use Parliament premises or the staff to which he is entitled as a Member of this House to raise that money ? #% As budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture , I can not but help notice that we spend one tenth of the money on education that we spend on olives . #% The Commission is currently studying new data on the structure of olive oil production in the various producer Member States , as well as developments in the world market where the Community is the leading producer by a considerable margin . #% Given the deteriorating situation in Ankara and the possibility that the military are moving into a position towards a possible coup d'etat , what would be the position of the European Union in that event ? #% Mr President , in this great debate about human rights it is surprising how infrequently we hear children mentioned - the people who are least able to protect themselves in relation to human rights . #% We have therefore shown solidarity with other like-minded groups and Members . #% I hope that you will support this initiative . #% Agreements of this kind should be totally reciprocal giving European airlines the same rights across the Atlantic as those given to US carriers in the European Union . #% Mr President , the economic crisis in the world today clearly demonstrates the fact that few countries are immune from the consequences of economic shocks in other parts of the world . #% We need an end to the hugely damaging dumping of subsidised agricultural exports on developing country markets . #% Despite all the shortcomings , the European Union and Parliament have made a most valuable contribution to the promotion of human rights . #% And they must ask themselves : what specific additional action should we be taking ? #% Industries that are facing that sort of competition have to look at the ways they can restructure , invest , change the process , introduce research and development . #% I am confident that if we had better , faster and more effective evacuation , we could save lives - as many as 300 a year . #% The Council is due to present its mid-term review of The Hague Programme at the end of the year . #% We have repeatedly condemned the Council for its lack of transparency . #% I should be very pleased if someone in this Chamber could give me a practical example of how the human rights of one of my constituents will be better protected as a result of the EU signing the convention . #% That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document . #% It is easy to see how some people pick on some groups but will not highlight the need for it to be applied to others . #% Regarding children and safety , we ought to do something , for instance , about invoking high standards of safety and protection required at swimming pools in order to avoid the tragic deaths by drowning of children , that too often cast a pall over family holidays . #% We are constantly struggling with the element of unknown risk . #% Therefore , there can be no good reason for opposing the meetings of Heads of State as has happened at Tampere to discuss these issues . #% This tide of higher education often returns home . #% In the United Kingdom , my country , two thirds of new doctors and 40 % of new nurses come from abroad . #% I look forward to further good work from him . #% This would be a dereliction of duty by any government . #% In our pigheaded determination to press on with the European project in defiance of public opinion , we show our brazen contempt for the voters and for democratic values . #% In the widespread opinion of this House , the presidential elections last November did not suggest that the American people wanted a wholesale change in government policy , but favoured a continuation of the previous policy . #% We have also discussed the time limit for funding and I am pleased that the Commissioner referred to that in her address . #% Thirdly , we need to work harder still on implementation to make sure that we are spending the money and not just committing it , and that we are spending it in accordance with the priorities which are set out by Parliament during the budgetary procedure . #% In addition , a wide range of affected sectors in Europe have a formal relationship with the Commission in this regard through EFRAG , the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group , which has been established for this purpose . #% It is something that is put in front of workers who are asked to sign away their rights to avoid employers having to negotiate or do paper work . #% Indeed , if we are going to apply the precautionary principle anywhere it should be applied to the extension of EU legislation into areas that are best dealt with locally . #% The first refers to how we handle outstanding budget commitments , which now amount to something around EUR 110 billion . #% Mr President , I would like to make four proposals to help the IGC reach a successful conclusion . #% It is my belief that if this becomes reality Gibraltar should seek self-determination or some sort of Andorra-type solution . #% I would also like to thank you for having moved that consultation day to a day that did not clash with a Strasbourg session , so that I and other MEPs were able to attend . #% You have said already quite clearly that the standing committee on scientific evidence is the highest authority . #% 
I would like to congratulate colleagues , especially the PPE-ED team , for getting to this point where much of Parliament 's position has been taken on board in the Council text . #% I am appalled at the dreadful populist campaign -- which has often been racist -- run by sections of the European press . #% Can I appeal to the President that especially since ... #% It is absurd that a poor country should get itself into a situation of paying back money to Brussels , but equally absurd that the case should have taken so long . #% Have you stopped the import of feathers as of today ? #% The only answer is regionalisation , and full involvement of all stakeholders . #% Those entitlements will include household allowance , health insurance coverage , survivor 's pension and annual travel allowance . #% The Court has seized power from the Member States and handed it to the Commission . #% Equally , we must ensure that all the states talk honestly in their approach to Kosovo . #% The Afghan police were described to us recently as basically cannon fodder for the Taliban . #% We need to find a way of getting the money to the people who are actually going to do some good with it . #% They all have great anxieties about the current catastrophic decline in their incomes , in particular those in the pig sector whose animals are fetching such low prices in the market that they are making a loss on every animal . #% If it has been possible to secure performance targets from Member States in relation to both youth and long-term unemployed people , why do we not seek a similar target to improve the employment of disabled unemployed people too . #% It is of vital importance that we in the European Parliament call the Commission to account when we are discussing matters involved with the spending of substantial sums of European taxpayers ' money . #% However , at least some of those chains pay their part-time 17-year-old staff more per hour than some junior doctors get in overtime payment . #% However , it is rather different for the new High Representative . #% We like to think of the United Kingdom as a rich country , but one in five pensioners are in low-income households ; the incomes of those over 75 are lower still . #% Mr Dell ` Alba , though , is also right to draw attention to the fact that we must ensure that there are no disparities or discriminations in our Rules . #% I welcome the continuing Commission commitment , repeated this afternoon by our colleague Mr Verheugen , to economic reconstruction in the Palestinian territories . #% Secondly , I would like to emphasise the importance of developing further cooperation with Russia . #% We need proper incentives to positive actions of this kind for a great deal remains to be done . #% Firstly , if this agreement is less favourable than the existing bilateral arrangements then the more favourable shall prevail . #% It has not delivered that in practice because of differences in interpretation between Member States , because of differences in enforcement between Member States and because of poor implementation . #% No wonder the US is irritated by European governments ' attempts to evade responsibility and I am glad that the President-in-Office talked about taking that responsibility . #% Secondly , if something is referred back in this way , it is only to one branch of the Legislative authority - the Council - not to both branches - Council and Parliament - as it should be in the equal system of co-decision we now have in the European Union . #% I trust that tomorrow we will confirm the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at its last meeting . #% I should like to ask the President of the Council , in the event of the agreement of 18 May coming into force - which appears unlikely at present - if the Minister can assure the House that this will not lead to the creation of serious obstacles for European traders seeking to carry on business activities in Cuba , those being implicit in Mrs Albright 's letter ? #% That is why the Commission has made , and will continue to make , useful efforts to assist Russia in its arduous transition by actions like targeting technical assistance at combating money-laundering and organised crime and supporting efforts to advance the rule of law in general . #% I urge us to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and add to its ability to check finance ministers ' discipline . #% I call upon the Egyptian President and the Egyptian Government to do the right , just and proper thing and to release the men in question . #% Lebanon , following Syria 's withdrawal , seems to be settling after its elections and arrests have now been made in connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri , apparently confirming the suspicion of the involvement of the pro-Syrian security forces . #% I have been asked by my committee to raise a number of points , the main one being the amendment that we are retabling on the Court of Auditors . #% Very often I have been more worried than I like to say about projects which have ceased to be effective , which needed to be terminated and closed down , so a three-year period is something that we can work with quite easily . #% We have delayed it in order to get this description . #% But now that the Lamfalussy issue is practically resolved , progress will be assured , leaving the regulatory framework requirement for the risk capital action plan well within our sights . #% That is the threat he poses to the region , and he has instruments which will allow him to put those weapons of mass destruction beyond Iraq 's national borders . #% The European Parliament will not accept that , Member States will not accept that , and of course , most importantly , the people of Europe will condemn us if we bring that into operation . #% It is the principle behind this that drove our voting decision . #% I hear with interest what the Commissioner has to say , but she will know very well that there is no comfort in that response for many lecturers in the United Kingdom who assumed that they were going to be guaranteed the rights they had in their previous employment . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs would like to see strengthening in relation to that point . #% One point is that we do not yet have a common fisheries policy . #% The British Conservatives can not support the measures in this report . #% But , on the other hand , this report has my total support . #% Mr President , when the two planes crashed into the World Trade Center they demolished more than the twin towers . #% It has been an interesting debate but I have to say that the recast - which you defend - is not in the spirit of the interinstitutional agreement and it is not enough . #% I believe in gender mainstreaming , but it should apply to disabled people too , with disabled , not able-bodied , people representing them . #% We must act now . #% Mr President , first of all I endorse the hearty thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Piecyk , who has guided us all for so long on this very complex and challenging issue . #% I then proceeded , because I wanted to talk to the pilot down the ... #% Let me just suggest a few possibilities . #% Most Member States of the European Union are an integral part of Nato , and even those who are not still believe that Nato is the fundamental guarantee for European Atlantic stability . #% That legal text also specifically guarantees that officials and other servants of the Commission shall , and I quote , `` in no way suffer inequitable or discriminatory treatment as a result of having communicated such information '' . #% I welcome the reference to islands in the Treaty of Amsterdam . #% The emphasis on religious identity that was the basis for the foundation of Pakistan , and its creation , sadly appears to foster a climate of intolerance and often even violence towards those outside the religious mainstream . #% Whereas the UK market is largely open , according to single market principles , regrettably the same can not be said for many other Member States . #% Surely the intention of Rule 151 is not to give the political groups the right to decide that the matter should not even be discussed in plenary when across the House so many Members regard this as a very serious matter . #% There is a lot of support for the EU playing a strong role in the world , promoting peace , democracy and the rule of law . #% That is the key question that the Commissioner is seeking to address this week with colleagues . #% I have long advocated a carrot-and-stick approach whereby President Lukashenko 's efforts at democratic reform and openness should be recognised and rewarded by closer ties to the European Union . #% We believe there should be specific benchmarks and possibly a more nuanced set of benchmarks for responding to human rights violations . #% I have one general comment and two specific points on the report . #% Let me take the remaining seconds to thank the Commission services , which have been enormously helpful in providing a lot of technical detail to a complete ignoramus like me . #% Third -- and I include two last points here -- we need to look at the question of the Constitutional Treaty . #% In conclusion , when we look to the future , at enlargement and our neighbours , we in the European Union must be more prepared to look strategically at our own interests . #% In the book 1984 by George Orwell , the state ministries were given names which represented the exact opposite of their functions . #% It is the depletion of fishstocks in our coastal waters and the failure of the common fisheries policy which is driving the cormorants inland . #% 
We heard the noise of democracy . #% On the size of the Commission , for instance , the formulas that are likely to be adopted tomorrow will refer either to one Commissioner per Member State or to a smaller number , a fixed number of Commissioners . #% In my remarks , I want to follow Mr Schnellhardt . #% It was about the agenda of the joint Council meeting on 27 February . #% To admit two countries that are even poorer than those that joined two years ago , with the inevitability , in percentage terms , of an even bigger migration ! #% Actually , I would prefer to call it an information economy because it is the economy aspect which is the most important . #% I hope now that all Members and all members of staff observe the no-smoking areas across the whole of the European Parliament building . #% Will you instruct , therefore , the ushers to tell Parliament 's staff to go back to work ! #% It will enhance workers ' rights and , over time , bring prosperity within the grasp of all Romania 's people : a true time of celebration . #% Lives are being put at risk , which is why we are demanding action . #% And these are not just errors : accountants describe them as serious financial malpractice . #% We must look to the future and cherish the distinctiveness of rural areas . #% Well , this is year eleven ; it is a shameful situation that can not continue . #% I have to give Mr Michel particular credit , even if he is my Liberal political colleague . #% The majority of people in Malta work in excess of 48 hours per week and need to do so for their own benefit and for the island 's economy . #% My Group would thoroughly agree with what Mr Watson has said to the effect that human rights are universal . #% That is why we constantly demand that the death sentence should not be carried out in the US . #% I would ask for a reinforcement of that effort during the next four months . #% Madam President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work . #% The European Union has not yet learned to deliver and manage its external assistance programmes efficiently or to properly spend the resources that have been allocated to these purposes . #% It has to deal also with the expectations of the new Member States and with longstanding members who wish to preserve their privileges -- such as Spain which wants to remain a net beneficiary to a greater extent than the much poorer central European countries , and Luxembourg which , in per capita terms , is both the richest Member States in and the biggest net beneficiary . #% This is something I have been urging the Commission to take on board for some time and I hope for a positive response . #% Full application of the Convention would take account of , for example , those suffering at the hands of the FARC , a non-state agent of persecution in Colombia , and would also cover political opposition in Zimbabwe and countless other instances . #% In other transport sectors , agreements between the social partners at European level on working time have largely been reached . #% If my fears and those of its supporters are ill-founded there is no problem . #% But that is a very small point . #% Mr President , like everyone else I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for the work he has done on this proposal . #% Moreover , the report also recognises the valid and worthwhile role that local and regional authorities can play in the process of job creation . #% This idea that there is a state of emergency but the elections should go ahead undisturbed does not hold water . #% Rule 63a of our Rules of Procedure states that we have to ensure that all reports are financially compatible . #% We must get to grips with this . #% Yesterday the Agenda stated quite clearly that after Urgencies , voting starts at 5.30 p.m. . #% I would have thought that it would be rather odd to treat them differently if domestic legislation did not . #% Many of us visited the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia and met women who are affected by this very severe health problem , which has not been dealt with very often in Parliament . #% We have asked for one of those lines to be in reserve precisely so that we can make sure that the funding goes to organisations that actually exist . #% That should suffice , but it is wise to add the provision on negligence as something which can be brought into play within the courts . #% Indeed , ending export subsidies is now made conditional on parallel movement from other industrialised countries . #% However , I shall not repeat the many reservations about the proposals that colleagues have already mentioned . #% Research by the Commission , by the European Environment Agency and by the Department for Environment in my own country all conclude that licensing GM crops will almost inevitably lead to widespread contamination of non-GM crops . #% Opposition leaders from southern African countries know what needs to be done . #% It has reformed its system of government and civic infrastructure and sensibly accommodated its problems with its Roma and Hungarian minorities . #% It falsely raises the hopes and expectations of policyholders and has been used in a blatant political way to attack the Government . #% Does he agree that in due course , once we are in a new context , we will have to return to the question of the text and what to do about it , if not in 2006 , then in 2007 ? #% The human rights dialogue with Vietnam is taking place on two different but complementary levels : the EU-Vietnam dialogue on human rights between EU Troika missions in Hanoi and the government , which will next convene on 26 November , and the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission , which is to take place tomorrow . #% Two thousand of these people have registered themselves with the High Commissioner for Refugees , hoping to be transferred to other countries ready to accept them , and for several years now the Iraqi Government has been working closely with UNHCR asking other countries to accept them . #% It is a pity Mrs Morgan is not still here in the Chamber , because I understood her to say that you can not just leave a discharge to systems alone ; it is the question of access to information , so that we as a Parliament can grant discharge . #% However , the report also provided for a list of third countries or parts of countries from which Member States shall authorise importation of bovine animals , swine and fresh meat . #% As spokesman for the British Conservatives and the Legal Affairs Committee , I want to begin by endorsing the remarks made by Mrs Palacio , chairman of that committee . #% His mother is currently travelling to Burma hoping to see him . #% This space-age system is to be made compulsory throughout the EU . #% I hope that I am not right , but if we go on like this , perhaps we should join in a chorus of `` Nearer my God to Thee '' , standing in the middle and singing it . #% Should buses and coaches be the first category to be charged ? #% They are fundamental to our citizens and also to the rights of this Parliament as a co-legislator , not to mention their possible fragmentary effect on the achievements of the internal market if they are not very carefully monitored by this Parliament . #% Presidential elections are scheduled for July : I have confirmed this from the Internet . #% What I would like to hear from the Commission is whether it accepts that the alternatives , sorbates and benzoates , needed to kill listeria , are equally effective . #% I pray now for the release of all hostages . #% There is a clear need for major diplomatic and political initiatives to maintain cooperation with those countries nearest to any possible targets or military action and those at most risk from the consequences . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the minister for his reply , but I must say that the fact that Mr Solana is so detached from the process of settlement of the dispute in the island of Cyprus fills me with great disquiet . #% Mr President , I would be fascinated to know at what stage the British Presidency realised that to have adopted as its logo a flight of birds heading towards Europe was a mistake ! #% As rapporteur for the European Year of People with Disabilities , all of us set out with very high hopes for this year . #% The continuation of the derogation is a matter between the Council and the Commission , but tax policy should be the sole prerogative of sovereign national governments . #% The budgetary competence for non-compulsory expenditure rests with Parliament and it can take its own decision in that regard . #% The current series of discussions have continued all through the autumn and are not yet at an end , but it is quite clear that we must come to some form of formal decision about the reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases in Kyoto - in particular CO2 - and that must be done by the end of the year . #% I am particularly grateful that he has taken on a number of the concerns I expressed in my amendments . #% We could not accept that , so I presume we will just have to vote . #% I would like to flag up one linguistic problem . #% 
Sporting excellence can only flourish in an environment of fitness , skill , training and fair competition . #% In this particular case , I do not believe that the EU should be able to foist road pricing upon the UK , or any other EU country for that matter , and I am therefore pleased to see an amendment guaranteeing the subsidiarity principle in this report . #% We must ensure that those sorts of events do not continue to happen . #% In fact the possibility of petitioning Parliament and the work of the Committee on Petitions are one of the most effective means we have of allowing individual citizens to use Parliament in a clear and a direct way to address their individual concerns . #% We have the Ombudsman 's very good service , Parliament 's Committee on Petitions , the Commission itself , which accepts complaints , and ourselves as MEPs , who receive constituents ' case-work , as well as SOLVIT and EUROJUST . #% It is worth remembering that the petitioners have fulfilled the conditions for exemption , laid down in Directive 83/182/EEC , from , in particular , turnover tax , excise duty and other consumption tax , in respect of temporary imports from another Member State of motor-driven road vehicles . #% This , in combination with a modification to Article 17 , which allows freedom of contract to choose ADR but respects existing consumer rights in the form of the unfair contract terms directive , presents a much more workable , legally certain package that will promote confidence . #% I expect that will happen again before too long . #% It is not quite good enough . #% We have found a ` consensus ' on one issue where there were five speeches in favour of a project and 49 against , but President Giscard d'Estaing felt that was a consensus in favour ! #% So that is a condition ; and there are many strong paragraphs in the resolution . #% That is important for all sorts of people and organisations which , we hope , will make use of the ability to re-use public sector documents . #% Prisoners on both sides still have to be returned and the Shebaa farms on the Golan border belonging to Lebanon are still held , controlled and occupied by Israel . #% Now the socialists are failing , it is business as usual . #% We in this European Union should follow that lead and ensure that every Directorate-General , every service of the European Union puts small businesses first . #% He said that he did not think there was a quorum on the vote on Mrs Buitenweg 's report . #% We are told that a vote is going to happen at a certain time and it never seems to be the case . #% The appointment must be by open process and must involve the European Parliament . #% I take Mrs Jensen 's point : what we are proposing is to link effort to recognised assessment and reward . #% They will not say . #% So here she is : never stood for public office , never had a proper job , and here she gets one of the top jobs in the Union . #% I personally can see no reason why , in that time , the main problems for small traders can not be met . #% On all of this , Mr Bangemann takes with him his knowledge and his contacts to Telefónica . #% Finally , in relation to the trialogue agreement of 1997 , the teachers and their representatives had the clearest understanding that they would be employed until retirement in exchange for agreeing new work practices and to work being put out to outside firms as teachers left . #% Over the past weeks in August , work has therefore continued in order to produce fresh and detailed models and options , which will be the subject of resumed discussions with staff representatives and with other institutions this month . #% We hope that India and Pakistan , with the support of the European Parliament , can take that road rather than the much more dangerous road for themselves and the rest of the world . #% Furthermore , it is destroying fish stocks and destroying such infrastructure as exists . #% She was attacking nothing less than the foundations of western capitalism , the engine which has delivered wealth and success undreamed of by earlier generations . #% Or , as I always say , ` EU must be joking ' . #% We can support the compromises that seem to be emerging in the IGC to take measures that would facilitate the national control that national parliaments must exercise through better time limits and better circulation of documents giving them the time to get stuck into issues . #% In retrospect we realise that Mr Schulz was right that we in the Parliament had done our work , the Commission had done its work , but the Council , for reasons of overcharge on its agenda , had not actually done the real thinking on the financial perspective . #% As a result , I have no doubt that this is an imperfect package and we will have to return to this subject . #% The Prophet Mohammed , peace be upon him , declared that Christians would be the best friends of his followers , the Muslims . #% I waited with bated breath . #% Greater transparency can also be seen as a guarantee of fair hearing of complaints . #% However , it would be far better if Members were here . #% How do we get over political interference if bank capital is at risk with the macro-economic consequences of that ? #% But whilst I welcome the positive noises coming from Brussels , it is not enough . #% It is much better for consumers when they do not have to check whether there are different arrangements from country to country or get caught out because there are . #% We are keen to learn what the Commission is going to do and what the Commission 's reaction is going to be . #% I thank the rapporteur . #% I would like to wish the President-in-Office a happy Christmas and say thanks to him for being with us over the last six months , because I have a terrible feeling that we will not see him again . #% It follows that Articles 12 and 17 of the Staff Regulations do not prevent staff from reporting wrong-doing either within the Commission or to OLAF . #% This nonsense , alongside US views on the need for abstention before marriage , is incorrect and quite simply dangerous . #% It seems to me that we lack the mechanism for the speedy release of funds in these post-conflict situations . #% All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation , and it is these laws which should be utilised fully rather than creating yet more EU legislation , which would have resulted in negative consequences . #% The other reason was that many Member States of the European Union prosecute and imprison people for exercising non-violent freedom of expression , the holding of heretical opinions or taking part in dissenting activity . #% It is clear that making this mandatory could bring considerable improvements for many workers across the whole of Europe . #% The Commission and its staff have committed themselves to that . #% Now I think that there is a big change in Washington , the free trade arguments are winning , but are we going to play the game ? #% I broadly agree . #% Robert Portman asked why the European Parliament was there and what the Members were doing . #% I , along with the majority of the British Conservative MEPs and the majority of members of my group , see genetic modification as an interesting and potentially very useful development for mankind and for our environment . #% At a briefing yesterday , Commissioner Flynn said there were around 100 000 job vacancies in the European Union in this area . #% I am from the south of England and had to take environmental health officers to France where we wanted to look at French nuclear power stations . #% These proposals are unfairly weighted against United Kingdom fishermen with a reduction in tonnage of 29 % compared to 20 % for France , 12 % for Spain and 2 % for Greece . #% 20 % of economic activity in Europe is directly or indirectly related to tourism . #% In general I welcome this proposal . #% A man of great courage and principle has lost his life and we as democrats honour his name and salute his life 's achievements today in this debate . #% Secondly , we have taken what I would call a sensible approach to the use of the reserve . #% If meaningful deregulation could be achieved then all the sorrow about the failure of the Lisbon Agenda could be turned to rejoicing as EU economies really begin to move out of the sick bay . #% The same principle of course applies to the European Union . #% I respect the anti-nuclear countries , such as Austria and Ireland , but new technologies such as transmutation , will , I believe , one day solve the long-term , high-radiation waste concerns of the general public . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency on the way it has conducted business . #% They say it will certainly make the EU more democratic , social and so on , but not enough so . #% This is something I have been adamant in fighting for , not just on behalf of numerous small and medium-sized enterprises in my own region , but also for SMEs in general which , if it were not for these low thresholds , would miss out entirely on funding which is there to help them achieve the goals of the programme . #% 
There is a danger of thought-police . #% He is both carrying out a progressive programme and doing so through the mandate of the ballot box . ' #% The new draft , however , has corrected this and is allowing sufficient possibility for political parties to receive modest private donations . #% If projects can not be completed within a reasonable time-scale , then the Commission should have the right to demand repayment of any assistance given . #% Then we want to make sure that the processing of food is safe and , finally , we want to make sure that when it is stored and retailed , it is still safe for us to take home . #% Would the minister agree that it is fear for their security that is proving the principle obstacle to Turkish Cypriot compliance with the Annan proposals ? #% Without that sort of protection people will not take the opportunity to live , move and work wherever they can within the European Union . #% We all know this is a phoney parliament , but this demonstrates just how pointless it is . #% My concerns are twofold , however . #% What is so important about this directive - and sometimes we perhaps forget this during our big debates - is that it has actually been the result of painstaking work by the Commission , to whom I would like to pay tribute . #% I have taken up a number of their suggested amendments , for example Amendment 2 , which underlines the need for the Agency not only to collect and disseminate information , but also to analyse that information , identify risks and good practices , and promote preventive action . #% We also believe that the central eastern European countries , having thrown off the mantle of Soviet-dominated communism from which we in the West were unable to protect them , and for which we can help to atone by welcoming them back into the family of European nations , do not simply wish to see the construction of another Brussels-led superstate . #% There is real concern in the industry that they will not be enough . #% Perhaps there will be an opportunity to advance further through the adoption of an administrative law for the Union 's institutions and agencies . #% He expressed concern at the very wide provisions for transfer of data and the potential for abuse in the Europol-US agreement . #% Along with Sweden and Denmark we have the lowest levels of unemployment . #% How long will we continue to treat them like small children , seeking to regulate and control every detail of their lives ? #% The amendments we are tabling reflect the current negotiating position and ask the Council and the Commission to bring back to us further changes that they will make beyond the original proposal . #% The Irish people saw to that , and you know that if you ask them again they will reject it a second time . #% in writing . - The EU 2020 objectives re-establish the need for closer integration between Member States ' economies throughout the European Union in order to encourage productivity , competitiveness and growth . #% Can the President-in-Office therefore assure us that there will be no climb down whatsoever on this very vital issue ? #% Secondly , could you give us some indication of when the House will know the procedures to be followed with its committees for the examination , with proper scrutiny , of the proposals now being made by the Council ? #% It is always encouraging to see the enthusiasm and energy Members of this House devote to that cause . #% It is important for our country and our national interest that Britain gives leadership to Europe at a time when fundamental questions on its future are being asked . #% We need to be a little better informed about the kind of regulatory burdens which we might be creating wittingly or , more importantly , unwittingly in the legislation that we pass . #% So , in small measures and not in large - because the United States must take the lead in these matters - the European Union can play a role , but it should not exaggerate its importance . #% The practice of shark finning is known to endanger the survival of several shark species . #% Why do we want to get it transposed as soon possible ? #% If we look at the study of Gulf War veterans that was done in the United States and compare that with the study of the control group , there is no difference in the death rates , or illness rates , or the rates of cancer between the two groups . #% The British Government is prepared to cede some of the sovereign base territory surplus to its needs , if this will help . #% Terry Freitas had spent two years helping the Uwa indigenous people defend their territory from oil exploration by Occidental Petroleum . #% The notion that a satellite technology system would be our sole system is to me quite ridiculous . #% I am grateful to the Commissioner for his reply although I have to say that five months is a long time to wait for minutes . #% Is it a coincidence that the cod are disappearing in the areas where the industrial fishing takes place ? #% We want speedy and specific action from the Commission in response to those judgments and then time to sensibly revise other provisions in the original directive . #% It can not be because this would be injurious to the process of national reconciliation in Chile . #% Parliament has to send out a very clear , simple message when we vote tomorrow , and say that people travelling in one of these vehicles must wear a seatbelt . #% If the country of origin principle is not honoured in the construction of the single market then I am concerned that it will not work to the benefit of Europe ' s citizens . #% You said you will look at it and try to clarify the situation . #% But this Parliament , surely , should have one thing in mind : the people of Iraq . #% We wish to record formally the breaking of these promises by the Commission . ' #% I wonder whether it would have been a good idea to relay it to all the Commission officials . #% If Ms Evan 's report does nothing else , it has brought to our attention the need to speed up the process , because that is at the heart of the reform of our procedures generally : implementation , how it is done , rather than innovation , is now always the motto . #% These include cleaning agencies who employ shifts of temporary night workers and then pay them at training rates for longer than necessary , and companies who effectively employ long-term agency workers at lower rates of pay than permanent staff , and who replace paid staff who leave with agency workers because they can lay them off much more easily and with poorer conditions . #% There are proposals within the report as to how we could help them to face up to their responsibilities , given that , at times , they use bushmeat as an apparently cheap and readily available food source for their workers and their vehicles are used to carry poached meat . #% By that point it was too late to bring the government and opposition together -- not that the opposition was particularly helpful when it came to sticking to its conditions for cooperation . #% This calls into question work permits attached to a particular job and company . #% None of us can be satisfied with our efforts to date to defeat poverty by promoting good health . #% Therefore , we welcome the new mission and mandate given to Felipe González as the personal representative of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office for the former Yugoslav Republic . #% Two hundred and fifty fully recognised partnerships and 250 partnerships with a limited range of statutory benefits would , for instance , generate total annual costs of under EUR 3 million . #% I share the concern that has been expressed by some Members today that the multinational protection force is not sufficiently representative . #% The Czech Republic needs to reassure us that competition policy will be in line with EU competition policy and that public administration will be reformed . #% Their long-term effects could be even more serious , including hypospadias , undescended testes and a range of reproductive difficulties in both males and females , which we really must take action about now . #% We vote on this report before Berlin , and we assume that there will be agreement in the Council on Agenda 2000 and between the Council and Parliament on the Interinstitutional Agreement . #% We all know the immense difficulties this has presented for Germany , and I recognise and pay tribute to the courage of the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister in particular . #% In addition , this is not a directive concerned with general disclosure requirements by companies trading on the market . #% Afghanistan is one of the poorest and neediest nations in the world and it sets a very frightening precedent if aid workers are attacked because of their faith . #% They can maintain hundreds of different species of wildlife , including many species of deep-sea fish , and they are a vital focus for fish reproductive cycles . #% The European Union should not hesitate now to do so as well and the Arctic Council , in my view , is the best arena in which to do so . #% I welcome the recognition that a restrictive approach to immigration has not worked and is counter-productive . #% One thing I have learnt is that people soon learn how to abuse and get round these systems . #% We should be stalwart in persevering with enlargement , despite the problems that we experience at present , some of which at least are clearly foreseen and foreseeable . #% That is not a position which either the majority of the Member States or the majority of consumers in the European Union would accept for one minute , and I want to use my brief time to argue the contrary case . #% The Conservative Party will stand by those principles , unlike the Labour Party , which ... #% I do not have time this evening to go through all of those in detail but I would like to observe that I have specifically asked the Commission in the text that we will receive at second reading to mark out more clearly those four aspects of the text . #% The candidate countries still have to meet our standards and they must not be allowed to slacken their efforts . #% 
Mr President , in relation to Mr Kerr , all I said was that I was now convinced that in the United Kingdom care in the Community was no longer working . #% Mr van den Berg was correct , and indeed kind and generous , in re-asserting the fact that the Commission must be responsible for its appointments and its personnel policies . #% It is not the fault of Mr Schnellhardt that there have - to put it mildly - been a number of obstructions . #% Mr President , Mrs Smet referred to the fact that a majority in the PPE-DE Group were in favour of including the self-employed . #% That is why I am disappointed with the news that Italy is likely to pull out of the project for A400M aircraft . #% It must be said that this situation is not helped by some rather hyperbolic rhetoric from certain European Union capitals , for example describing the summit as a `` make-or-break event '' . #% Parliament is consistent in its view that we do not want to put any obstacles in the way of competitiveness and innovation . #% Let us be honest , Europe 's armed forces have a woefully depleted capability . #% Of course Members of Parliament have a perfect right to do this , but we should be aware of what we are being asked to approve . #% This human tragedy demands a compassionate response . #% As it is , the extenuating circumstances are that there has been a global recession , although Commissioner de Silguy very often claims that we have withstood this global recession almost 100 % . #% Nearly 40 % of our trade with the EU was to France . #% I hope that we will come back to this discussion at a later date . #% In its original proposal , the Commission proposed a Type III ( a ) committee . #% I am speaking as someone concerned with consumer affairs . #% I believe this will happen . #% Another point I want to take up is the proposal regarding the building . #% At that Council meeting , Commissioner Fischer Boel said she felt that this reform was going to strengthen her hand . #% The people understand that and are aware of it . #% I can give him the assurance that all influences and all means of representation are being employed in the most forceful possible way in order to try and secure the outcome that the Commission , the Union generally and Members of this House - including Mr Staes - want and that would be consistent with humane and just treatment . #% Nonetheless there is still a lack of transparency in the Council , so I wonder whether he could just lift the veil momentarily by answering some questions . #% I can remember making this request in December 1979 when the Russian troops were getting together to invade Afghanistan . #% As chair of the US delegation here in this Parliament , I am only too well aware of the many slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that make up the trade disputes between the EU and the United States of America . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I really enjoyed hearing the Commissioner say that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly was now a robust organisation . #% As far as the growth and employment initiative is concerned , I was delighted that this was approved unanimously in committee and that we had made some progress in becoming lighter on our feet . #% So finally I would say that when the second reading comes up , if we are serious about creating jobs , if we are serious about keeping our industries really competitive , if we are serious about encouraging enterprise , then some of us may feel we have gone too far and that it may well be time to draw a line . #% We want to see the decision taken on Friday evening , not waiting until Strasbourg . #% Just what is it about English wine that becomes so intimidating ? #% There was a conflict of interest where the government was the programme manager and the applicant . #% It was Lyndon Harrison who , as rapporteur on 16 September 1998 , said to this House : `` It is time to outlaw cheating practices and give small and medium-sized enterprises the confidence to go boldly into the single European market knowing that they will be paid on time and in full . '' #% The European Parliament must speak out strongly on this issue . #% The imperatives of the technology should be linked to what consumers need , as well as what the production empires want to sell . #% As the amendment says , we would like to adopt guidelines for the decision to establish , select and appoint EU special representatives and for the regular assessment of their work . #% This seems to me to be a process that will not work , is not right . #% Clearly , Mr Prodi had in mind the replacement of an ancient hegemony with a new economic one . #% I must underline that what we do not want to see , in case anybody hangs this round my neck , is a supra-national European environment inspectorate : lots of little men and women in blue uniforms with gold stars rushing round the Member States , reporting back to Brussels saying this is wrong or indeed , in the case of Germany , this is right . #% I suggest that this is because the French authorities are unable to offer a decent service by air or any other means to get home after a meeting . #% An independent United Nations backed force is required to ensure that voting in the East Timor referendum takes place in conditions free from violence and intimidation . #% In relation to these and other cases , the Commission consistently calls upon the People 's Republic of China to comply with the letter and spirit of the United Nation 's human rights conventions which it has signed ; to do so even before China 's ratification of those conventions and actively to pursue ratification . #% Let us put matters into perspective , since this is the nub of the issue and is why we have supported Mrs Fourtou in her work with the Council aimed at reaching a genuinely balanced compromise that will be in place on 1 May , thereby ensuring we do not have to wait another six to nine months to deal with this problem . #% The fact is that , if viewers want to watch American or any other programmes day and night , then nothing can stop them , certainly not the EU -- or is that the hidden reality ? #% Finally , the proposals in this package can only be seen as necessary steps and I would therefore urge the Commission and the Council to accept Parliament 's reports and amendments in the sure knowledge that rivers , forests , towns and cities from Middlesborough to Milan will be healthier , cleaner and better places to live in future . #% Firstly , it caused the world to look , for the first time perhaps , at the whole question of Islam as a religion - but I will leave that for the moment . #% My final observation is in relation to Taiwan . #% The pressures on the system in Spain and other countries are self-evident . #% Whilst in principle the Commission is saying it supports our demand for `` black box '' voyage data recorders to be fitted to all ships , can it confirm that relates not just to new ships , but also to existing and old ships ? #% Nobody in this House asked for UN resolutions to attack Milosevic 's Serbia , and human rights violations alone were deemed sufficient . #% In the Commission 's Communication on European Space Policy ( 26 April 2007 ) the aim of meeting ` Europe 's security and defence needs as regards space ' is one of the key objectives . #% We do not , for example , accept the need to do away with documentary evidence proving family relationship . #% It does , however , ensure that particularly at our respective borders our planning takes account of the environment quality within and across our borders when planning frameworks are being agreed . #% The British Government has GCHQ in Cheltenham . #% In some cases , alas , that is not so . #% What has it got to do with the European Union ? #% We have to inform people about how they can protect themselves . #% I am speaking for the committee , Madam ; I am speaking in my turn , and you should wait for yours . #% As it stands , the vertical approach in favour of people with Aids as proposed by one of our Member States could seriously jeopardize existing public health systems by creating parallel systems . #% It has come to my attention that a group of EPP Members visited the USA in July . #% This is the tale of the rough justice of a British and EU citizen , Mirza Tahir Hussain , condemned to death on 1 June -- his 36th birthday -- a matter of days away . #% At the same time , we also stress the need to remove the militarisation of Pakistani society and deplore the failure of President Musharraf to stand down as army chief , as he promised he would . #% There are also suspicions that both countries are helping Iran 's covert weapons proliferation programme . #% These concern support for the recommendations of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia . #% I suspect they will not be that charitable . #% Other organisations in Member States are needed to pick up where the EU has shown the way . #% When they have not been able to be there , their positions have been faithfully represented to those meetings . #% I congratulate Mr Van Velzen and Mr Paasilinna , who are both here tonight , on the initiative of the hearing we had the other week in which the Commissioner participated . #% Although giving Commission officials an easier life might be one effect of this proposal , the way this is being done is to give national competition authorities limited powers to enforce the competition rules hitherto the monopoly of the Commission . #% 
According to the European apparel and textile organisation , Eurotex , the sector could risk losing 1 000 jobs a day and up to a million jobs before the end of 2006 . #% It is up to Member States to promote the most appropriate calculations , especially for their micro-companies . #% Mr President , British Labour Members voted against the report because our amendments to remove errors of fact were not carried . #% We will also support , on reflection , Amendment No 24 in the name of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and her group . #% Perhaps it is because the Americans have given them ideas beyond what the European Union can deliver - because Americans constantly believe we can take Turkey into membership - or perhaps it could be because of their domestic situation . #% Finally - sadly - commodity prices were conspicuous by their absence from this agenda . #% The United States , on the other hand , is looking much more to the problems of 2020 , with the weapons of mass destruction and a whole range of other things , on a global basis , which we tend not to do . #% Every EU country where there is a Tamil community should establish special police taskforces to investigate and prosecute the agents of the LTTE , as well as freezing bank accounts linked to them . #% That is why I called for a legally binding Convention . #% This is the issue that we are discussing today . #% On balance , however , we can accept the amendment . #% He recommends that the reform of the justice system should be observed more vigorously from the beginning of the accession process . #% To indicate the sort of actions that are going to be financed in order to reach the goals set out in the programme , it covers things such as data collection , a revised set of benchmark indicators , studies to identify good practices in Europe , workshops and studies , looking in particular at the adjustment of industry to the structural change generated by digital technologies and the transformation of society . #% Effectively it is becoming more and more difficult to find out what is happening and whether human rights are being abused as we sit here today in this Chamber . #% This objective was achieved , and like most signatories I should then have been very happy for the Motion to be withdrawn . #% And does he agree with me that we need to have convergence of defence expenditure by Member States ? #% I am free to say that my party , UKIP , can never support the Lisbon Strategy , because it is the failed strategy of a Commission that has no legal right to dictate economic policy to my country . #% It is only by rigorous , free and independent monitoring on all sides in Colombia , to which human rights groups provide a courageous and unique contribution , that impunity will be challenged and that a climate of respect for peace and for human rights will be created . #% I therefore commend Amendment No 43 to the House . #% Notwithstanding any statements of respect for the position of Member States in relation to ECHR , EU accession to the convention will complicate and possibly hinder the freedom of Member States to derogate from or individually interpret aspects of the ECHR . #% In that context , I particularly want to ask Mr Liikanen tonight to take up the question of the uncertainty facing thousands of my constituents who work at the BMW-Rover factory at Longbridge in Birmingham , where major investment is planned to produce new small cars for the global market . #% We have also made clear that both national authorities and stock exchanges may continue to insist on higher standards of disclosure and corporate governance as a requirement of listing , if they so wish . #% Parliament will have to approve these agreements , and I hope that the Commission will keep Members , especially the interparliamentary delegation and the International Trade Committee , fully informed and involved at each stage of these discussions . #% We need to try to change that emphasis . #% Therefore , to talk about the European Parliament 's new role and responsibilities in implementing the Lisbon treaty is breathtakingly arrogant and symptomatic of the institutional imperviousness to democratic opinion that characterises the EU . #% However , I do have two areas of concern which I must mention . #% Firstly , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for the work that he and his staff did in producing what was a good report until we had that regrettable vote in committee which has unfortunately now produced a report which I personally can not support . #% In view of the report in the Financial Times today , we should perhaps address that particularly to Poland . #% I think it should be the Heads of Government and the European Council who should travel to Strasbourg four times a year and have their meetings here . #% Sanctions were previously available ; they simply lacked credibility . #% Dilution of safety standards is not an option . #% Mr President , I support both the line of the proposals which have come from our colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt and the objective which many people in Parliament have been trying to achieve for the past ten years . #% The USSR would never have left these countries if it had not been forced to do so by the economic collapse of the Communist system . #% In addition to some 90 staff redeployed from other tasks or seconded from Member States , 51 extra personnel are now to be recruited to expand the European Union military structures . #% . Mr President , in his first statement in July , Mr Barroso said that we have to choose one priority , and that priority must be employment . #% Some concern was expressed in Scotland that because certain types of island were excluded from the study they might suffer where future policymaking was concerned . #% I am pleased to see that the Council of Ministers has attended our debate and I thank them for that . #% In addition , crews on larger container ships have difficulty in assessing when severe loads are moving forward and/or aft due to weather conditions , which can amplify vertical acceleration in these areas beyond the vessel 's actual design specifications . #% This is a matter for great regret . #% Despite this sticking point , this report should be applauded . #% The rapporteur has brought the two together in a complex series of amendments culminating in No 25 , which I will support . #% It is a good job that it was proposed because it has ` saved our bacon ' for the last three years . #% The same problems are occurring in regions and Member States across the European Union . #% Mr President , we are now close to the end of what has been a three-year process of reforming the legislation for the control and genetically modified use of organisms as products within the European Union . #% The Conclusions also mention the means of promoting sustainable and fair trade . #% This Parliament regularly churns out details like that , prepared by people who probably have not the faintest idea what it is like out in the real world , where real people have to try to put all these new rules into practice and still manage to turn a profit . #% In the on-line world , we must think differently . #% Amendments came from the other side of the House as well . #% My suspicion is that one of the motives behind this proposal is a desire to enhance the status of the EU to show it is a player on the international stage . #% My fourth point is in relation to our procedures . #% If we are going to speak out , we also need to be critical of some of our media , which is also determined , it seems to me , to sow hatred rather than information and integrity . #% What is the advantage of good doctors if there are inadequate medical facilities and resources ? #% I feel sure that Commissioner Wallström will feel let down by DG Fisheries . #% Firstly , we are mutually dependent on each other for the safety of our food and drink . #% Second , are they based on any cost impact assessment ? #% Firstly I would like to say that the previous speaker , my illustrious committee chairman , was being slightly disingenuous because there is no real demand for a European public prosecutor . #% The 4 June opposition rally went peacefully , as just two weeks previously police had beaten back opposition protestors who tried to hold a rally in Baku despite an official ban , and dozens were arrested . #% It gives me the opportunity to address the wider problem : the threat of war again between India and Pakistan . #% We know that in many cases those public services are not good enough , not efficient enough and are delivered at much too high a cost . #% The key to our final vote was the need for reform . #% On a more pleasing note , let me move on to my second set of remarks on the 1997 budget . #% We have tried to present a more acceptable formulation , which , sadly , I think is unlikely to succeed here at today 's vote , and I would therefore urge colleagues to support the deletion , to allow us to return to this at conciliation and do the work properly . #% You can not have your fudge cake and eat it by denying such inherent flexibility in the Treaty . #% Just compare it for instance with the document I picked up last night at the party celebrating the wines of Provence : that makes me want to drink a glass of Provençal wine , I am not too sure this pamphlet does much for the European Ombudsman . #% Concerning languages , technology and the Internet , we need to expand the services to ensure that we are ever more efficient and put our money to the best use at all times . #% In his written evidence he said that there was clear evidence of delays in decision-making by the British Government , inadequate briefing of potential applicants , poor or ineligible applications blocking systems , inadequate appraisal of applications and a potential conflict between the applicants and decision-makers , particularly in the case of the government itself , as the programme manager and applicant . #% 
I and many of my friends , neighbours and constituents lost our animals . #% We enjoy very active collaboration in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and , again as Mr Cornillet says , the parliamentary nature of our work has noticeably increased . #% The political groups are in wide agreement on this matter . #% We would prefer help for redundant workers to be funded by national governments . #% The first two points I would like to make relate to categories of workers where we have managed to achieve that progress in the conciliation . #% This states : `` Welcomes the public commitment of the European Central Bank , in its annual report for 1999 , to establish a cooperative relationship with the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF but regrets clear incompatibility between the public commitment assumed by the ECB in its 1999 annual report to establish close cooperation with OLAF and the decision by the ECB itself to prevent OLAF from carrying over internal investigations , pending the ruling by the European Court of Justice . '' #% We are quite capable of setting our own rules and we are quite happy to have our truck drivers abide by yours . #% The Commission is the enemy of the nation-state . #% The European Parliament has gone even further , calling for cover for accidents which take place in non-EU countries , provided that the vehicles involved are registered in the EU . #% It is very important that we acknowledge that tourism is a major industry in many developing countries . #% As a man who is greatly concerned with these matters , perhaps if he had attended yesterday he would have understood that today we are only establishing the estimates . #% But I seek the help of the Commission now to clarify those areas of doubt which will arise when Members see this , especially over lines B5-321 - action for the economic and social areas like cooperative mutuals , etc , - where a large proportion of the money has not yet been utilised and there does not seem to be a way of utilising it . #% Madam President , may I draw attention to the fact that the photographer is still sitting up there . #% Thank you for that very comprehensive answer . #% The whole question about the importance of services and opening up service markets is one we are about to address seriously within our own internal market . #% Inevitably , this sector will decline somewhat in the short term as the economic crisis continues to set in . #% I am , as I said before , an interloper from the trade community and it was certainly an interesting and useful exercise for me to see how trade policy and transport policy have in this case come together in an extremely satisfactory manner . #% Taylor was indicted for war crimes by this court in 2003 , but Nigeria is refusing to extradite him , claiming he has sovereign immunity and benefits from the asylum deal they agreed to . #% This seems to the British Labour delegation a recipe for further delay . #% We send our condolences to his loved ones in their hour of grief . #% I found this sycophancy absurd , as my values of democracy , human rights and gender equality are alien to Saudi tradition . #% After all , food has been treated with ionising radiation for some 50 years , as the rapporteur rightly said . #% However hard this Parliament tries , it is very difficult in terms of the budgetary allocation that we have to make sure that we ring-fence the kind of money that we need . #% Malaria is responsible for at least another million child deaths , and in total more than ten million children die every year as a result of conditions for which we have effective interventions . #% The treaty will not come into operation until six months after forty countries have signed , but I am delighted that one or two European Union countries are in the forefront . #% The Chinese said that he had two lawyers . #% The EU should be involved only where there is some genuine , proven added value and not as a means of extending the competence of EU institutions into yet more areas of activity . #% I believe this fast track trial and the conviction being upheld is contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights . #% You are not confirming that the building satisfies health and safety and fire regulations ? #% However , she left me with a serious physiological dilemma : how to applaud her with one hand while gesticulating angrily to her with the other . #% However , the majority of my Conservative colleagues have voted to reject the report and will vote accordingly in this House . #% That will allow us then to get to grips with issues like counterfeiting and lack of respect for intellectual property , which are major concerns for us at the moment . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs has considered these four cases over a long period of time and is now in a position to make recommendations to the House . #% If we are to overcome the obstacles ahead - institutional change and the need for political and economic reform - we need such leadership more often and then we can really celebrate . #% Turning to the roles I mentioned , I believe that monitoring internal markets in gas and electricity , participating in the development of network codes , contributing to the implementation of the guidelines on trans-European energy networks , monitoring progress on implementation of projects to create new interconnector capacity , having the power to decide on exemptions from requirements for investments in infrastructure , monitoring implementation of the 10-year network investment plans and having powers to issue opinions and recommendations to TSOs - along with other aspects that I do not have the time to enumerate - will all give the Agency ample opportunities to bring about change . #% We must ensure that disabled people and disabled people 's organisations are involved in discussions about what is needed and in the delivery . #% However , to ensure that manufacturers adhere to this directive and that it is successfully implemented , account must be taken of the peculiarity of some manufactured goods . #% We finally voted in favour of this report because there was a very great deal in it that we believe is right and needs to be said and should be supported by this Parliament . #% While my group considers that this should be the final objective , it also considers that the adopted code is a genuine improvement . #% Finally , the process by which this final agreement was reached was highly unsatisfactory , with last-minute technical proposals being introduced -- verbally , not in writing -- and with no time to properly study their implications . #% Will you join with me in welcoming an end to the historic wrong that has denied the people of Gibraltar a voice in Europe ? #% Studies have also demonstrated that failure to implement any one of these three elements results in a significantly reduced impact . #% Mr President , this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life . #% That is certainly something which should be addressed and , I believe , is addressed by the amendments which the Commission is tabling . #% So the work ethic will be there from the very start and we will be able finally to reduce the level of dependency in the Union . #% That is genocide . #% Furthermore , I hope the EU institutions can together make progress on this issue before the next WHA meeting in May . #% Meanwhile , on the trade side , pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements . #% The reason we are talking about countries which are broke - and they are broke - is because their ridiculous , ineffective , ignorant politicians consistently spend more money than they can raise . #% They have given a very balanced opinion on how we should give guidance to the Commission and the Ministers in Dublin . #% However , the EPLP could support the main thrust of the approved text and therefore voted in favour of the report . #% The European Parliament may have confidence in Mr Barroso , but other recent votes out there in the real world suggest that the peoples of Europe have lost confidence in his project . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for its statement . #% The Commissioner did not mention this , but it would be sensible to do so because TV , radio and state-owned newspapers in Zimbabwe are acting now as if they were the agents of Zanu-PF . #% I therefore urge every single government throughout the European Union to use this money , use it effectively and use it quickly . #% Louise McVay 's petition brought our attention to MS in 2003 and it is only right that , three and a half years on , the Commission reports on the progress it has made in ensuring that the code of best practice , in particular , is implemented . #% The recent Operation Mountain Sweep has only brought a few weapon caches to light and we still have a long way to go to make this beautiful country a peaceful and prosperous one and a respectable member of the international community again as it was once in the 1960s and 1970s . #% I do not think anybody could disagree with that . #% It is strongly in the social and economic interests of the EU to integrate such people , and hypocritical , in the light of other EU policies , for us not to do so . #% Last and not least , we should use the summit with George W. Bush to draw up an agenda for the period until 2004 , to establish a deeper transatlantic partnership and to fulfil the aims that both the Council and the Commission have said they want to achieve . #% The Lisbon Centre has to have reliable , accurate information and be able to monitor and involve all the different agencies in as many countries as possible . #% Let us hope now that this practice can be discontinued completely , across the EU and in the accession countries . #% The same question or allegation has subsequently been made in other petitions , some signed by hundreds of Names and several on behalf of thousands . #% We do not want to stop air travel , we simply want to ensure that its growth is not at the expense of our children and our future . #% These are some of the important points in the proposal , but others include the definitions of working time and stand-by duty . #% I particularly welcome progress on Article 4 of the framework directive so that the principle of appeals against NRA decisions on the substance of an issue , not just on whether procedure has been followed correctly , has been accepted . #% 
It is a law which is both employer-friendly as well as efficient at directing attention towards the ` safety culture ' and practices required to save lives and reduce injuries . #% The system can only be complete once the Council - which is the second chamber of our legislature - joins in , but I welcome the tentative steps forward which are being made and I thank the Presidency for its statement this afternoon . #% This is taking place at the very time when we would have expected , because of the changes that have taken place in Indonesia , a movement in a different direction . #% Mrs Peel , who was pregnant at the time , was alarmed to find that she was being denied therapies and treatment by the local health authority simply because of where she lived . #% The compulsory changes in contracts which many thousands of further education lecturers have had to accept under great duress have resulted in those lecturers having to teach much longer hours to much larger classes . #% I would like to say a word about the situation in Cyprus . #% Finally , on a specific issue , the Commission 's work programme misses the point by a great distance when it promises a Green Paper on a corporate sense of social responsibility in the middle of this year . #% And the EU says it wants to help the third world ! #% Without those , I would submit that we are not able to judge whether or not the tunnel is safe . #% In layman 's terms , that means I can tell my claret from my hock . #% But time does not permit it and I shall simply content myself by thanking those who sent me here for doing so and saying that I will try and serve their interests as best I can . #% One barrier between the UK Government and its goal of bulldozing through a third runway at Heathrow is EU air-quality limits , in particular nitrogen dioxide . #% Representatives of all sectors of industry have indicated , at a public hearing , that they see huge problems with the Commission proposals . #% A code of conduct might not suffice . #% There are , however , areas of concern about our relationship with Russia : and if we share common interests , I am not convinced that we share common values . #% Just to pull all these things together in the context of the work of the Internal Market Committee over the next five years , I am delighted that , I think , all the coordinators of the committee are here today and I want to thank them for the work they have done , together with myself , on shaping the forward agenda for this committee . #% I hope there is a satisfactory resolution to this problem , but at the moment it is another serious blow to the euro 's credibility that the rules are not being enforced by the ECOFIN finance ministers . #% Bosnia 's constitutional reform is vital , not as an interesting intellectual exercise , but in order that the state can put in place efficiently the regulations and policies necessary for economic success , including EU trade opportunities . #% But , obviously , I have completely misunderstood the fact that we have resolved overnight the issue of the common agricultural policy . #% Can you guarantee it is going to happen or does someone have a veto ? #% We must not lose sight of Romania and Bulgaria , or their objective of joining in 2007 . #% We need to set an example to the world . #% This report has only been possible because of the collaboration with my colleagues in my Group and across the groups , and I am deeply grateful to them , to the shadow rapporteurs , to the Group , the committee and the parliamentary secretariats . #% My follow-up question is : Does Commissioner Kinnock think that this national derogation is unhelpful and , as a result , would he be making any recommendations on a personal level to UK manufacturers to instal tachographs as a matter of course in the UK ? #% Mr President , there are many factors which purchasers may wish to take into account when choosing a model of car . #% There is an irrational fear on the part of China of Taiwan wishing to pursue a course of self-determination and independence , perhaps because the model of pluralism and democracy is what is most unwelcome to the Communist Party bosses . #% For too long now we have been pussyfooting around . #% Virtually all documents will be placed on a public register . #% Quite frankly , we would be castrated with a pair of rusty scissors . #% Provisions under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights , along with case-law , make clear that persons arrested within the European Union must be brought promptly - and that means within seven days - before a judge who must free them immediately if no foundation for their detention exists . #% If I may paraphrase the ancient Greek proverb for the President-in-Office : `` Those whom the Gods wish to destroy , they first raise high . '' #% It does not actually say that such a temporary committee should be set up . #% I have spent some time this year going to countries which are ` complex environments ' , to use the terminology of the United Nations : China , Cuba and Russia . #% I regard consideration as positive and urge him to bring that forward . #% I hope that the Commission will deal with this point in response because it is particularly important that the issue is highlighted and that the Commission response is on public record . #% I would like to say to Mrs Dybkjær that in the comprehensive pursuit of our policy for equal opportunities , there will be evidence as the coming months and years pass , of us giving attention from the point of the invitation to applications , right through to initial appointment and promotions , to show that we are making serious efforts to secure substantial advances in the number of women of all ages and all grades who are employed in the Commission . #% I am suggesting it would be appropriate for Parliament to conduct such an investigation in view of Mr Prodi 's former position as President of the European Commission . #% That is something we should think about for the future . #% in writing . - I am opposed to moves towards a common immigration and asylum policy in Europe . #% Mr President , I wanted to thank you for allowing a gap between the debates this morning and the votes at 12 noon to allow Members to come in and take their seats . #% Overall , I sincerely hope that Afghanistan will again be a respectable member of the international community as it once was . #% We ought to also send out a very clear message that much has been done in Mostar . #% The common text we have before us is united in making sure that Saddam Hussein is clearly identified as being in the wrong ; that there has to be implementation of UN resolutions . #% This would subvert the convention and it would be an insult to this Parliament . #% That was as good as it ever got for Haiti , which in our lifetime has sunk into poverty and terror . #% There is much to be done in Afghanistan . #% I would like to expand a little bit on that point . #% Parliament is not getting the answers it requires . #% Europe has missed an historic opportunity to modernise its workings to meet the demands of an enlarged and more diverse Union . #% Having the opportunity to speak in this debate gives me the chance to welcome not only the Council 's conclusions on the creation of a single European sky , but its determination to submit proposals on slot allocation at Community airports to Parliament by June . #% The fact is that such immigrants who have come from central and eastern Europe into the UK , Sweden and Ireland have not been a drain on the economy , but a benefit to it . #% Nothing so far has happened . #% However , I do still have some concerns about it . #% The tragedy is that in areas where we have a rudimentary common policy , through the scientific committees and the new Veterinary Office in Dublin , some Member States still break ranks . #% Has he any idea of the timescale ? #% There remains , however , the problem of financial services . #% Mr President , enlargement is truly one of the great stories of the EU . #% Giving farmers greater powers to make their own decisions concerning vaccinations is a welcome boost to the farming industry in Wales and will ensure that livestock can be exported without the current restrictions . #% That again seems to us to be a very welcome development and we are very pleased to see that a balance seems to have been struck - a sensible and workable balance between the needs of developing countries and the need to develop new rules within the World Trade Organisation . #% Another item was the inventories . #% As such the British Conservative Delegation supports the rejection of this Council proposal . #% I rise on a point of order under rule 132 concerning the agenda , with reference to question time . #% To bring the wording into a more neutral stance , I would like the paragraph to read as follows : #% Let us be clear : the issue is not the rights of white farmers , it is the rights of all of the people of Zimbabwe . #% Romania , and now Albania , have signed US immunity agreements and Bosnia is under pressure . #% This is a direct consequence of the activities of illegal migrants coming out of Sangatte . #% 
A lot of these cattle are going to Lebanon , and their journeys do not end there : they continue for a great many hours after that . #% For us , the best way to stop the trade in illegal timber was to strengthen requirements and obligations and enhance the legal means to prosecute possession and sales by operators placing illegal timber and timber products on the EU market as a deterrent . #% Madam President , hundreds of thousands of people die each year from the use of perfectly legal drugs . #% Its deep-rooted knowledge of its early European status in the Roman Empire gives it every encouragement to work through these difficult times and in due course become a full Member of the European Union . #% For example , the UK has the National Health Service code on recruitment of health workers , but it only applies to workers recruited by the NHS directly . #% I would ask us to send an observer force because there could be more trouble in those local elections than in the other elections . #% We hope that when this agreement is again reviewed , the Commission will consider still more assistance to contribute to the development of added value projects , such as processing and canning , which will make a real contribution to the local economy and local living standards . #% Question Time is a very valuable institution . #% To protect England 's precious greenbelt land and to end overdevelopment and towns merging , we have to abolish these unwanted and undemocratic assemblies and return planning issues to where they have been dealt with traditionally : town halls . #% Could Commissioner Kinnock inform us as to when he might possibly be bringing forward legislation on the whole question of the transport of nuclear material ? #% Unfortunately , at this stage the running is being made by American companies and we are much slower in catching up on development of this software . #% I worked very hard to get them support and I intend to keep that support for those ACP countries . #% I continue to believe that craft built for users ' own use should be exempted for five years , provided they are not placed on the market . #% Furthermore , the provision of a ` CE ' mark of confidence on products will give those conducting their own projects the confidence that the materials they are using are safe . #% The strategy suffers from an unacceptable imbalance and a lack of strategic vision for follow-through . #% I am interested in the fact that some countries are already putting into their national indicative programmes a priority for parliamentary training and capacity-building , but out of 78 countries , if we are honest only a handful have made that kind of priority clear . #% In the telecom field , it is clear that market share can change hands much more quickly than in some of the major industries that have been regulated in the past . #% We also learned that Mr Mandelson enjoyed a holiday with the lobbyist Peter Brown , and that he also went on a luxury yacht owned by the Microsoft cofounder , Paul Allen . #% Turning specifically to the matter of administrative cooperation , I believe that automatic exchange of information is beneficial . #% It is not too much to ask . #% So we have seen rackets developing in baby-selling , mothers having their babies stolen , mothers being bribed to part with their children , mothers being conned that the child is going to benefit from a good start in life and return to the family when , of course , there is no such intention . #% As you point out , Mr President , the question raised by the honourable Member is not the question that has been tabled . #% We are very concerned that some hauliers will be able to undercut their counterparts from other Member States if we do not pass this directive . #% BNFL has responded positively to the 28 recommendations in one report and 15 recommendations in the other , the falsification report . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , looking at the Commission 's programme for 2007 , I am struck not just by the new areas in which the EU seeks to strip more power away from my country and from the ex-EU slaves and eunuchs who run it , but by the brief mention of the term ` constitutional treaty ' . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Ferber on his report . #% Whether taking part in sports or just going about normal life , the number of European citizens injured , disabled or even killed in accidents is quite staggering and is recorded in detail in the report . #% Certainly the military are tackling the financial fraud that exists on a massive scale with vigour . #% I hope that in the interim period , whilst the election is taking place , the interim government will be genuinely neutral . #% I hope the Commissioner will support the idea of more regular reviews , just as I support him in opposing the idea that quotas should be set for long periods of time . #% Because the extremely powerful and wealthy organisation called The National Rifle Association - the NRA - helped to elect the present administration , which will therefore not stand up to the Association . #% It appears to me that they have not taken any notice of it . #% I have told this story for two reasons . #% At the same time , I would extend my congratulations to the rapporteur , Mrs Jackson , for the work that she has done on it . #% But the fact is that for 53 more Members of Parliament we are creating a further 23 posts . #% Could I briefly ask the Commissioner if he can be specific now on an issue many of us , including Mrs Hulthén , have raised with him before , that is the potential dangers of plastic inedibles which are given away with sweets and other things and which are not a foodstuff . #% British troops always deserve the best available equipment to protect themselves , but reports that white phosphorus grenades were used in Iraq have been shown to be wrong , and neither does Britain have any DU stocks in Iraq . #% Let me say as a friend , admirer and respecter of many NGOs - and I rely greatly on their advice - that were we to postpone , we would in fact be handing to NGOs the right of eventual affirmation or veto of this agreement . #% The former , in particular , set ambitious and legally binding targets for reductions in pollution and improvements in air quality . #% Safety considerations must always be paramount when dealing with nuclear power . #% Out of the tragedy of Izmit let us hope for positive and permanent improvements in the relationship between the European Union and Turkey . #% In particular I want to look at the supply chain that industries are involved in . #% In a single market , size must not matter . #% Madam President , I agree with the Commissioner that this is about citizenship of the European Union and it is crucial for the facilitation of the free movement of our citizens . #% We do not realise that these palaces are basically cities in their own right and that is why all aspects of the UN inspectors ' mandate must be adhered to . #% Did you vote on this matter ? #% The fuel can be safely used for the purposes for which it was manufactured . #% Therefore , we had no alternative but to abstain on this report . #% The existing directive certainly needs updating , but we must not be too rigid . #% The unwarranted attacks on valuable public servants such as policemen and prison guards are completely unacceptable and can not be substantiated . #% Charities face a lot of difficulties caused by the VAT system and the amendments relating to charities in the report , and indeed tabled by the PPE-DE Group , are essential in trying to mitigate those problems . #% Mrs Roth-Berendt has mentioned a target with which I will concur . #% I am therefore very sorry that the great efforts that the rapporteur made to get full agreement were not actually rewarded . #% So does Gordon Brown , the new British Chancellor of the Exchequer , who would agree with us that ` Jobs R Us ' is the cry for Europe . #% There is pollution control - and I was the rapporteur some years ago , on measures which are now being implemented to control emissions . #% The right to inquire into the conduct of those supremely responsible for administration is an essential part of good governance and a necessary complement to , not a substitute for , the work of this Parliament in exercising democratic accountability in relation to the College . #% The negotiations with the Belgian presidency at the second conciliation were 100 % better than the first conciliation , which was a waste of time , as I made known last time . #% The Labour Party , the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party all voted in favour of a European arrest warrant . #% In my view - and I hope it would be the Council 's view as well - it would assist us in our efforts to stop arms trafficking into Burundi and , indeed , within the Great Lakes area . #% I would draw attention to two ways we could perhaps get improvements . #% Such clauses on core labour standards have to become the means to actual enforcement and that is the test for the Commission in following up this communication . #% Mr President , it is vitally important that the European Parliament sends a very clear message that there is no case for military action in Iraq . #% That it failed to do so was a sad reflection on its failure to learn the lessons of history . #% I believe that there are some on the right of this House who wish to muddy the waters and to draw no distinction between asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , third country nationals . #% If we are to assess compatibility with the Lisbon Agenda , I wonder why that was not done before . #% Against that background , on 23 April two Canadian NAFO inspectors accompanied by a trainee carried out an inspection of the Community fishing vessel Santa Mafalda which was operating at that time in the NAFO regulatory area . #% 
I wish to thank the Commissioner for his reply to the question by Mr Evans . #% I hope Mr Bushill-Matthews will tell us tonight with his customary subtlety that he understands the position we are in . #% Two things I would like to highlight : Amendment No 29 , which tries to make sure that there is no hiding place for racism , no hiding place behind considerations of religion , considerations of belief and considerations of nationality . #% I am very pleased that we have got the compromise amendment on music and leisure , whatever the rapporteur says : to have five years ' exemption for the music and leisure industry , for the Commission to do a report , and then to come back to this House , but to consult with both sides of industry . #% On another level I must highlight the observations of the rapporteur that there is an increased sensitivity amongst Members of Parliament about who makes the decisions on trade : whether it is the Council or the Commission . #% We shall wait and see . #% Then , and only then , can real austerity packages work . #% In this regard , I hope that the Vice-President/High Representative will raise the issue of Georgia , parts of whose territory remain annexed and occupied illegally by Russian soldiers , and help also to put pressure on Russia to solve the Transnistria question in Moldova . #% On that basis , I believe that this proposed directive is wrong and I will be voting against it . #% The one area where there is a need for greater legal certainty is the issue of confidentiality at a time of mergers and take-overs . #% Perhaps most important of all , the Copenhagen Council should set a process in motion , as Mr Prodi mentioned this morning , to consider our approach to future candidates seeking membership of the Union , so that we know how to deal with them . #% Secondly we must examine every single avenue , such as a special partnership with Turkey , before we commit ourselves to the full process of opening accession negotiations . #% Mr President , will you join me in condemning this breach of the Vienna Convention and will you write to foreign ministers of Member States reminding them of their obligations in this matter ? #% The whole mechanism of the hierarchy of remedies can and will work effectively and beautifully here . #% Nobody can deny that NATO 's record is what we should be seeking to protect , not to undermine . #% In the past , the measure used to calculate whether debt was sustainable was a calculation of debt payment against export income , but the really crucial question is how much of the national budget is being used to repay debt . #% That is what is forcing principals down this path even where they would actually prefer to concentrate on meeting the educational needs of their students . #% Not all these murders have taken place in obscure rural villages , some were in built-up areas . #% In fact , I have figures here from the UK , which show that a 10 % increase in the price of cigarettes leads to a 4 % decrease in consumption . #% We also need clarity , however , on understanding the threat we face and the best measures to deal with that threat . #% Perhaps in the modern age such markets are no longer the best way of dealing with the trade in animals . #% May I thank the Commission for an excellent initiative on our relationship with the UN . #% We should insist that if there is a global quota , we must have enforceable and effective guarantees that ACP traditional bananas will be able to get into our markets on at least the level of access assured by Lomé . #% Our armed forces are desperately over-stretched and lack key items of equipment . #% On behalf of the EPLP I would like to outline why we will not be voting in favour of the Fruteau/Daul resolution . #% I would ask that the last two words be deleted and that you accept that as an oral amendment . #% In fact , of course , none were permitted . #% In this European Parliament , we should particularly regret the jailing of nine of the party 's elected mayors and the banning of two of its MPs . #% I realise that on the basis of Parliament 's position , we can only delay membership from 2007 to 2008 . #% Mr President , I failed to catch the President 's eye this morning . #% Colleagues , without doubt , there is major and well-grounded public abhorrence about the use of animals for testing ingredients in cosmetics , and all concerned want better protection for animals worldwide . #% Smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice . #% Mr President , I merely wish to observe that Mr Moorhouse is far too left wing to have a place in the modern Labour Party . #% But I share colleagues ' view that there is no point in agreeing a commitment to eliminate child labour and then relying on exclusively voluntary agreements with business to achieve this and other legitimate development goals . #% He was also given the right to give an explanation of vote . #% Parliament is not always pointed to as being responsible or informed , but in this particular area we were better informed and , in some respects , I feel , more responsible . #% Compiling and implementing the very substantial changes has , of course , required immensely hard work and dedication . #% I am going to speak with two tongues in this debate : one - as an individual who has been involved in the debate in the negotiations , and then , as it is my responsibility to speak , in my role as coordinator for the Socialist Group . #% Tension is building up very seriously and a large-scale military confrontation is threatened , as thousands and thousands of Sudanese troops are now moving into the region with trucks , bombs and guns . #% To put this directive into perspective , recreational craft in the EU are responsible for less than half of 1 % of all exhaust emissions in the Union and if it is the case that this regulation turns out to have severe impacts on small boat owners , driving them unnecessarily off the waterways , then sadly this will merely increase disenchantment with Europe among many of our citizens . #% Through this programme the European Union has given high priority to combating poverty-linked infectious diseases , such as AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis . #% It is still very ad hoc as we can see from Parliament 's work . #% We now see a massive protest vote by ordinary Palestinians . #% These amendments are a bad and unnecessary deal for consumers and the industry . #% We all want to preserve our identities and how we feel about ourselves , and we need to do that . #% In this context , I would very much like see a retirement package for existing farmers linked to bringing in young farmers to carry on the industry . #% I hope we can react accordingly . #% As to whether Mr Lukashenko should be allowed to participate in the summit in Prague to launch the new Eastern Partnership in May , such a step , to my mind , is probably premature , as President Lukashenko still needs to demonstrate an irrevocable commitment to EU common values and democracy . #% The situation has changed , however . #% Therefore it seems totally wrong for this Annex to be included which only refers to individuals and organisations who appear to be solely from the Islamic Community . #% Change and reform are positive words , but they need to be accompanied by concrete deeds . #% How does the minister think that contributes towards the completion of the single market ? #% The last of these must be workable , because otherwise we will keep the previous speaker happy ! #% Madam President , before we proceed to the Schwaiger report vote , could I raise a point of clarification ? #% Mercifully , no one was hurt . #% Now that it has appeared , goodness knows what they feel like . #% It is not quite true to say , as recital ( c ) of the von Wogau report suggests , that Europe 's single market remains a jigsaw of 15 separate national markets . #% I welcome this consultation process but I will pay more heed to the concrete proposals that will follow . #% One-third of illnesses amongst women aged 15 to 44 in developing countries are caused by sexually transmitted diseases , back-street abortions or pregnancy . #% Medical and scientific evidence demonstrates that there is a real need for this directive . #% I think we in this House will have to get used to the enhanced cooperation procedure on measures which actually link employment and migration . #% With regard to Galileo it is worth remembering that this programme was actually instigated by the Council in March 1998 . #% I have been a harsh critic of the handling of the EU-Israel Association Agreement , scrutinising the precise application of the human rights clause on numerous occasions on the floor of this House . #% We understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism . #% My primary reservations stem from how to best secure the military 's involvement in the Single European Sky . #% This applies not just to the Roma population , where more vigorous action is required , but to Bulgarians more generally . #% 
I know everyone is in denial : we have had the Bulgarian Prime Minister here , the Romanian Prime Minister here ; and they are all telling us that it will not happen , that there will not be a huge movement of peoples , but of course there will . #% We English are very tolerant . #% I do not ask for that for one second . #% Senior figures in the USA have called for Mr Assange to be assassinated or kidnapped , and for the US Government to act as if it were at war with WikiLeaks , which they describe as a terrorist organisation . #% I agree to some extent with a code of conduct on the conversion costs . #% While the proposed directive puts limits on that , we know what long periods of detention do to the mental health of individuals and to children who are detained . #% We want to ensure that pensioners have high returns without any additional lack of security , applying the prudent person principle . #% The United States made it clear that it would take no part in these proceedings . #% The Iberian lynx in Spain has been saved by Natura 2000 . #% The hearings are a very visible part of the process of the appointment of the Commission , which underlines this principle of accountability . #% I speak for some Members on this side of the House in saying that there are concerns about this report . #% A year on there is no directive . #% Clearly from the comments that we have heard already , the global institutional arrangements intended to underpin food security , as recent experiences testify very clearly , need serious attention . #% Mr President , whilst recently at my sister-in-law 's house , I noticed that she had a container of `` eco-friendly '' washing-up liquid . #% This has been played before the national courts on many occasions , and the judgments have gone against the plaintiffs . #% I think you did a wonderful job , but could you explain why the EU is continually being blamed -- particularly by the United States -- for holding up the talks ? #% I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur after the sometimes stormy passage of her report and the mini-ambush which she almost suffered tonight . #% Hence my committee ' s call for all European Union funded training initiatives to take the environmental dimension fully into account , if we are really preparing people for the future . #% By all means let the research go ahead , let us look at the issue again in a few years , but please do not try and saddle the rest of Europe with unenforceable limits . #% Mr President , my delegation voted in favour of this Commission because all along we believed this was a matter of competence of the Commissioners . #% I would like to congratulate everybody on the hard work they put in . #% The Israelis have not quite paid back the money - which may amount to about one thousand million euros now - that they have withheld from the Palestinians ' own revenue over the past year . #% Is it not deeply offensive that one European Union government has invited Mugabe to a summit conference in Paris ? #% So let us nail that particular argument . #% We have asked the Commission for information on how the money can be spent , whether it can be spent in time or whether all of it can be spent . #% An increase in transparency means that we reduce false speculation about the content of the negotiations , but also , to be fair , highlights the positive role played by the Commission in trying to persuade the negotiating partners of the need for greater transparency . #% I have also been asked to say a word about implementation . #% Indeed , above all , safety first should be our guiding rule , and I am sure it will be our guiding principle in the months to come . #% Does the Commission agree that there is now an urgent need for a Plan B to get world trade policy back on track and for the EU to play a key role in shaping the world trade order ? #% Belgium is about to fall to bits and the rest will follow . #% I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler to recommend to Member States that they introduce such a policy throughout the EU . #% With advanced screening techniques , it is possible for breast cancer to be identified at an early stage . #% We got it through the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs . #% Can I put a very direct question to the Commission , and possibly also to the rapporteur ? #% There is a great confidence - rightly or wrongly - that the driftnet fleets of the Atlantic will disappear because of this Community regulation that has now been agreed . #% We learn in the United States that torture at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere was mandated at the highest level of the Bush Administration . #% Indeed , the road map for peace between Israel and Palestine is published - it is on the Palestinian Authority 's website . #% An American diplomat expressed this nicely a few days ago : he said that we , in Europe , are looking at problems from a 2003 perspective : the problems of building the European Union , our foreign policy and the beginnings of an external strategy . #% That is what the citizens are going to look for in our enlarged Europe . #% It would not only be seriously detrimental to the safety and freedom of homosexuals in Uganda , but it would also tarnish the image of Uganda throughout the world and make it into a pariah . #% We need to set the people of Zimbabwe free . #% We will have a chance to return to this subject , as he says , when we get the detailed proposal for the Staff Regulations . #% Such a move would certainly ensure that in future the British people could see when British ministers renege on what they have pledged before entering such meetings . #% I and other colleagues waited ten minutes for a lift down to this floor . #% Another local women 's project in my constituency - the Southend Women 's Refuge - also supports this initiative . #% Although your Prime Minister will make a wonderful speech here in the plenary in July , reporting on the presidency , a speech in this chamber is not the same as a comfortable talk to the peoples of Europe . #% It is to be regretted that Socialists have broken with the practice of not doing a report on one 's own country . #% I will say what I feel , not what I ought to say . #% Mr President , as someone who suffers from a neurological complaint , to wit Parkinson 's disease , I am naturally biased in this matter , but I am a little shocked by the frequent use of terms like ` unacceptable ' and ` dignity ' applied to people who wish to find a solution through medical research to the terrible problems facing those who suffer from neurological disease , such as Alzheimer 's , motor neurone and Parkinson 's . #% That is essential if we are truly going to integrate the market for capital raising . #% Tonight we particularly praise Mr Cabrol - and Mr Collins , as the committee Chairman - but the diligent work of Commissioner Flynn and his team in DG V F plus the Chairman-in-Office of the Council of Permanent Representatives , means that another success can be chalked up to add to the growing numbers of welcome conclusions to consultations , particularly those carried out in the manner which Mr Cabrol referred to . #% On the one hand the developed countries undertook to provide billions of dollars in new resources , but , for their part , the African governments committed themselves to good governance , democracy and human rights and the rule of law . #% As a Vice-President of the all-party group on Kashmir in the European Parliament , I said then and repeat now that the people of Jammu and Kashmir should take great heart from the fact that this group is genuinely all-party and genuinely represents all nationalities , and that this Parliament remains committed to ensuring that their voices can be heard loud and clear here in this Parliament . #% Political parties are not NGOs , they are fulfilling a different role and they are vital for the functioning of our democratic system . #% On the actions that we need to take , it is of paramount importance that the law enforcement authorities be given the tools necessary to defend us , without being hamstrung by too much bureaucracy . #% Similarly the level of communications and appropriate timing has renewed the connection between share owners and boards of directors , allowing questions to be put without the ` nuisance effect ' which could jeopardise effective management of shareholder meetings . #% Nevertheless , there are signs that Mr Lukashenko is slowly warming to the West . #% Mr President , there are two key reasons for action in this field . #% We need to hear from the Commission on two points of principle : the first is whether the procedures themselves need review as the Commission spokesman suggested in the debate in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy ; secondly , whether there is a more efficacious way of removing additives as well as bringing them into effect . #% While agreeing the surveillance network means obligations on Member States , the Council has agreed unanimously only a more general flexible framework for information exchange and coordination of efforts . #% This burden , as the Commissioner has just said , must be reduced and the procedures simplified . #% Mr President , the launch of the notes and coins has finally made the euro a political reality for the 300 million people of Euroland . #% I was delighted in my own constituency of Portsmouth that a grant of EUR 150 000 was given to a consortium of museums , including Portsmouth 's D-Day Museum , dedicated to peace across Europe . #% Then there was a further delay within Parliament , because we are not perfect in that respect either . #% There is a European advertising standards alliance and we do not want to create some separate organization - some new quango , as we say in British usage - to replicate what that does . #% It is already very clear that this enlargement of the European Union is going to require the same kind of international effort if we are to see it through successfully . #% 
I urge the House to support these changes . #% We also must be clear that this project is so important that we are not prepared to let any one country sabotage the whole negotiations . #% France , Belgium and Luxembourg remain solidly against completing freight liberalisation . #% I hope this will not be a case of ` legislate in haste and repent at leisure ' . #% Mr President , on behalf of my group I would like to welcome the compromise resolution which we have just passed . #% What sort of results can we expect after hearing reports that civil society has not yet been involved in a genuine and meaningful way ? #% These two together will exert an effective and proper control . #% We welcome the comments of the EMAC committee that the need for administrative costs and taxes and charges on SMEs to be reduced should be particularly stressed as these represent one of the biggest obstacles to growth in employment . #% The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy did well in rejecting the rapporteur 's amendment and indeed , from that point of view , I am happier with what the Commission is proposing . #% It is also the location of some of the most ruthless regimes , ranging from the old Iraq of Saddam to the current government of Iran . #% Without better implementation we are deceiving the people of Europe into believing that things are getting better and better , in the words of the old Labour Party advertisement . #% Mr President , this is a vital issue for Europe . #% An article on education was incorporated at Maastricht . #% However , we must remember that it is not easy to apply the consensus and conciliatory approach that characterize this Parliament to the deep historical divisions of Northern Ireland society . #% As far as we are concerned this is unfinished business . #% But when the prospect of change hangs over people 's heads it can be destabilising , demoralising and demotivating , which is in nobody 's interests . #% Enlargement and reform go side-by-side . #% ECB : minimum reserves - ECB : sanctions - ECB : statistical information #% Sadly , there is provocation by people who should be showing leadership . #% The Heads of Mission statement and report show practical ways of doing so . #% My information is that they are being pushed into project funding and 18 environmental NGOs , for instance , are receiving from the Commission funding towards their running costs . #% Our citizens can see that our economies are in crisis , that unemployment is rising , that businesses are finding it harder to generate growth , that climate change is getting worse and that other parts of the world are becoming increasingly and dramatically more competitive . #% I would be amazed if any Member of this House voted against . #% I would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other Commissioner . #% Does anyone here really believe that the Council is listening to us ? #% At present , no such system exists and it is time that food producers became solely liable for food safety . #% Indeed that was one of the reasons for creating the euro in the first place : it was precisely to protect the European economy from the volatility of the foreign exchanges to which Mr Goebbels has just referred . #% I therefore welcome the Commission proposal to extend the pilot project for satellite tracking of vessels in the regulatory area of the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization up to 31 December 1998 . #% Should the EPP amendments to this report be adopted we will oppose the whole report . #% For example , I have always thought that the fee scales in Germany at the lower end work well to ensure that claimants with low value problems can pursue justice . #% It is madness for us to put our house in order and then to see food coming into the European Union that does not meet the same safety standards as ours . #% Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about , because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms . #% I have long argued within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that it is important that Agenda 2000 and WTO dovetail together . #% The Commission proposal needs alteration , otherwise it would drive execution-only business out of business by making it uneconomic . #% This has been going on for something like 13 years . #% Turning to the amendments , the Socialist Group will be opposing all the amendments because we think the report is excellent as it stands . #% And what is our solution to all of this ? #% That is meaningless without these amendments . #% Business-as-usual can not go on indefinitely : we must bring this issue to a solution . #% We have given the Commissioner four questions and we look forward to hearing from him in due course . #% We wish we were not at this stage today , but I look at this from the point of view - which I share with several colleagues , that we do not want asylum seekers to be seen as criminals . #% We very much appreciate the work of the Dutch Minister , Mr Pronk , in seeking to find a way to solve the unresolved issues left over from The Hague , and we would appreciate it if the Commission could give us its view on how successful he has been to date and whether or not the work he has done has now cleared the way forward . #% Will this presidency not recognise that its actions have led to victimisation and effective isolation of a large section of its own population ? #% We should not be surprised when war produces refugees - it always does - and indeed , as has already been said , some of our Member States have a very grave responsibility for that situation . #% Since chicken at the moment can be legally sold when it is 55 % water and is adulterated by other proteins which the perpetrators of this scam boast is PCR negative and , therefore , can not be detected by most tests , is it not the case that there should be a more direct form of action from the Commission ? #% In the Committee on Development and Cooperation we have on countless occasions stressed the need to plough resources into basic health and basic education if we are serious about poverty reduction . #% It is interesting that there will be three UK speakers , but that reflects the communities we represent . #% If we add to that an international dimension where the victims find themselves in a foreign country , the problems may be multiplied : differences in language , procedure , inability to identify or trace the third party , let alone deal with insurers . #% I want to thank him for the work he has done at a time when he was enormously engaged in the REACH proposals , which are now before our committee . #% In drawing up requirements for an EU prospectus , it is important to strike a balance between the objective of lowering the cost of capital for businesses and that of protecting investors . #% At an exhibition in Brussels put on by the Dutch Presidency , it was predicted that another ten poor European countries will be joining the EU by 2022 : Albania , Armenia , Belarus , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Georgia , Macedonia , Moldova , Montenegro , Serbia and Ukraine . #% Mr Conseco 's testimony was made more poignant by the reports on Peruvian television last Sunday morning of an elaborate system of telephone-tapping by Peruvian security forces against opposition leaders and senior civil servants , including the government 's own foreign minister , who I understand has now resigned . #% In the past , a few years ago , an official from the Council used to attend the committee regularly . #% As I have said , the figures for the EU 15 have improved over the last decade and I am convinced that the key health and safety directives that we have put in place , and the work of the Bilbao Agency itself , have made an important contribution to that improvement . #% These two institutions stand accused of imposing neo-conservative economic fundamentalism on the poorest countries in the world . #% Carole Tongue has referred to that . #% It has no democratic legitimacy . #% He obviously has a better circle of friends than me , but no matter . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , the EU communication policy that this report evaluates was devised in an attempt to - and I quote - ` halt the rise of euroscepticism ' . #% To begin with , we must remember that the best advertising in the world will not sell a poor product . #% Although the accession of the new Member States has meant a re-focusing of these funds , I am delighted that the new package agreed for the next seven years will continue to see a continuation of this funding for Yorkshire and the Humber at a substantial , albeit reduced , level . #% But as I have tried to make clear , appeal is available , right up to the House of Lords . #% We recognise that Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 was not the end of the game but merely the beginning of a long -- arguably cultural -- journey to win the argument for openness and transparency within the three institutions . #% In 2000 he received an eight-month suspended jail sentence for his involvement in an embezzlement case and was banned from holding public office for two years . #% That is why I welcome this proposal , particularly the work of my colleague Mr Nisticò . #% in writing . - UK Conservatives believe that , while cross-border cooperation in criminal justice is important , the report seeks to create a common justice area at an EU level , which would significantly compromise the traditions of those countries which base their legal system on common law . #% 
If we can achieve those two things , along with the other things , it will be a tremendous advance for all those countries . #% It is a problem for all of us , but you are , with respect , making it worse . #% Finally , the only other point of substance where I have a slightly different view from Mr Andria is the suggestion that we should prescribe that clearing and settlement systems are based on a ` not for profit ' principle . #% We need to explain what the European Union is trying to achieve with the single currency project and with enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe . #% I am led to understand that in fact the document that was presented at the Ecofin Council was not the text from the Commission but the text that had been produced by the Monetary Committee . #% But now finally , because of Amsterdam , we have this process which allows the strategy to have real teeth . #% These small firms are often the first step on the ladder to successful employers of the future , and they need to be nurtured , especially during times of recession . #% We want it down by the same percentage again . #% We need to resolve this between the three institutions . #% I disagree with Mr Goodwill on the legal base . #% All the reports before you agree on that and on the need to strengthen the legal base in the Treaties for it to be achieved . #% I want to use my time to cite just one example - a petition to the European Parliament from various names at Lloyds of London . #% The real substance of this report and my concern is as raised by Mrs Jackson , that the Commission may not give its support to these proposals . #% The opening up of a simple effective system of cross-border disputes is the committee ' s goal in introducing the concept of ADR and we welcome the way in which this has already been picked up and worked on by the Commission . #% I understand the technicalities and thank the Minister for that . #% The directive finally adopted covered only two specific types of work equipment : mobile equipment and equipment for lifting loads which are very important areas in their own right . #% We do so safe in the knowledge that any outstanding concerns or problems will be rectified by national governments in Council during the implementation stage of the new procedures . #% The House would surely like to welcome the news on the peace process in Northern Ireland and the decommissioning of weapons . #% We have noticed over this period that the financial perspective , as Mr Colom i Naval pointed out in one of his working papers , is indeed somewhat rigid and requires certain changes . #% However , the Commission hopes that the Community producers concerned will benefit fully under derogations from the rules as they relate to approved planting programmes , although the olive oil in question would count towards the maximum guaranteed quantity which has already been set . #% I disagree with what Commissioner Bolkestein said earlier on this point . #% My group does not believe that pension costs will necessarily destabilise economies or society , if such choices on spending are made carefully . #% If this House is not sovereign in fixing its own agenda , what is it sovereign in ? #% However , this issue is not about controlling airspace . #% Yet , Mr van Velzen misses one thing in the Plooij-van Gorsel report : coordination . #% Those not meeting the criteria listed therein would be subject to the same rights and obligations under the directive as employees . #% My approach in considering this text has been to give strong support to the strategy behind the directive . #% Well , we wait to see what these are going to be . #% The general approach to the discharge procedure is to look at the percentage of the budget line that is spent . #% But let us not dodge the elephant in the room : this is not just about banks , it is about sovereign debt and the stability of the euro : inextricably linked and overwhelmingly important . #% I can only say that I welcome the opportunity to provide comprehensive information . #% Madam President , Mr Tindemans is to be congratulated on the diligence and intellectual rigour with which he approached this contentious subject . #% In an important presidency conference on the theme in Athens and in securing agreement on the family-reunion and long-term-residents directives you have gone some way to rebalance the EU agenda which has been much too focused until now on control and rejection . #% I totally support what Mr Nielson has said about the financial regulation and given that Members of other committees than the Development Committee are here and are part of the process for agreeing such legislation perhaps he could elaborate on that more . #% On NAMA , there is a demand for rapid acceleration of negotiations on the basis of an extreme formula which most developing countries have already rejected . #% I particularly welcome the three-year review , because my only concern is that Member States should implement this legislation that they have now signed up to . #% Why should we accept a retrograde move to allow one or more governments to preserve what is , frankly , an unfair system ? #% Thank you , President-in-Office , I am very glad that the Austrian Presidency has been particularly active on that . #% I hope that this new EU initiative , the Maritime Safety Agency , will coordinate , monitor and enforce maritime law . #% We therefore welcome them very warmly . #% Often the agency jobs are lower-skilled jobs , so those nurses do not even have the advantage of gaining specialist skills while they are in Europe . #% We have to recognise that high environmental standards must be paid for , but high environmental standards will also give us benefits . #% in writing . - The UK Independence Party fully supports the cause of genuine human rights . #% The theatrical way in which the matter is being handled is creating an atmosphere of hysteria , and the EU has played its part in that by holding well-publicised , international summits to discuss the bird flu crisis . #% We know that demographic , environmental and economic issues interrelate to produce the political problems and the migratory flows to which Mr Sakellariou referred . #% On the accession of Bulgaria to the EU on 1 January 2007 , weaknesses remained in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime . #% Therefore , I appeal to the federal and state authorities of this big African country to rapidly re-establish law and order , conduct a full investigation into the identity of the culprits and , in particular , where there has been outside provocation or infiltration , bring all those concerned speedily to justice . #% Surely the Council made a decision on 22 November and it is now a . #% There are many older people in Britain today who recall 1971 decimalization as a time to cry foul against the ticket touts making money out of those unfamiliar with a new currency . #% Mr President , I would like to say a few words about the reason for this question and for its urgency . #% Could you at least raise this with the Commission and Member States in the Council to try and make the transitional periods as brief as possible ? #% That is a good move . #% EU aid should be conditional on recipients making sustainable efforts to improve their own behaviour . #% We can not have a transatlantic partner that is protectionist as we move into the 21st century . #% The curious thing about those barriers to trade is that they often complain about the same thing , wine for example . #% It failed to exclude self-handling or to ensure compulsory authorisations -- the ` must or may ' issue -- and it failed , in particular , to exclude marine pilots from the scope of the directive . #% Would the Council not agree with that ? #% Before the recession in the 1980s they invested in new capital every year and our help has returned them to the path of growth and new competitiveness . #% I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure , safer , higher returns . #% Shahbaz Bhatti knew he was in danger , both as a Christian in a country where religious intolerance is rife , and as Minister for Minorities who fearlessly denounced his country 's draconian blasphemy laws . #% Citizens of future EU Member States are also incarcerated there . #% However , he said that if we followed the initial proposal , this huge backlog would take 50 years and see some 6 million animals destroyed . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I would like to insist that the chairman of my committee , Mr Hernández Mollar , speaks ahead of me . #% But let us start by remembering , as the Commissioner said , that health is not an EU issue . #% I happen to believe that the human rights assurance in European Arrest Warrants should be an explicit condition of extradition , even if the Commission hates that . #% I , along with Mr Coveney and various other Members , have been campaigning on this subject for quite some time . #% 
It will cut the administrative costs of many multinational companies ' pension funds , allowing people to have better pensions when they retire . #% It is equally understandable that they will want to preserve the existing Nordic free movement arrangements and that their membership of Schengen will be contingent upon the willingness to accept that Norway and Iceland should be included in that as well , expanding Schengen to some 13 members . #% If Spain has such a large surplus of vets that it can afford to send so many to my country , why is it having such difficulty implementing the system of veterinary checks required by this directive ? #% Given the curious coincidence and timing of these unusual and unexpected deaths , this House might hope that Europol and the intelligence services will look closely at the surrounding circumstances . #% I voted against it in committee and I ask this House to do the same . #% Is it that the Commission wants to use the old tactic of divide and rule by attacking the solidarity of the ACP Group ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , Commissioner , this debate is an evaluation of the situation regarding the new Hungarian constitution , not the common law of the United Kingdom which has protected our citizens for nearly 900 years . #% We have to look very carefully at the links between development and international fisheries agreements . #% I call on the United Kingdom government to offer more assistance to its French counterparts and to the hauliers and businesses concerned , rather than seeming to turn a blind eye to their concerns and difficulties and spending more time harassing truck drivers and train operators with prosecutions and fines . #% I am also glad that we have a chance to debate this because if it had been rejected on a second reading in committee , we would have had no chance to debate this today in the plenary session - no chance to put forward the amendment to exclude music and leisure for five years , and Parliament 's view would not have been taken into account . #% I personally would start by advocating tightening of the sanctions against Tiraspol by asking President Yushchenko of Ukraine , who was here this morning , to further demonstrate his independence from Moscow by preventing Mr Smirnov and his 16 cronies from travelling to Ukraine as the EU has already done with the visa ban . #% I want to congratulate both the Commission and the Italian presidency for the very active role they took . #% Surely it should be possible for people to work for any institution at any age , even if they are as old as I am ! #% We were in danger of doing just that and putting the testing into countries where the welfare of animals was a much lower priority than it is within the Member States . #% Therefore , I must reluctantly support Swedish , Dutch and Austrian workers being supported from it . #% If a non-reply was sufficient , there would be no point in having the Treaty obligation in Article 197 . #% Was there really no conflict of interests ? #% They will often succeed , and in consequence , investment and hence commerce in all Member States will be hamstrung and hobbled . #% In my report , Commissioner , I recommend which practical actions , investments and processes are needed if we are to identify that very special place for children in external action . #% We must do much more with respect to that . #% The parliament of Algeria is currently debating an amnesty for all those guilty of crimes against detainees , in the interests of peace and reconciliation and turning over a new page . #% We are , however , favourable to Amendment No 6 which requests a review of the progress being made in achieving the aims of the regulation . #% I feel that , on the general detection and prevention of salmonella , the rapporteur is right to take us down this road as long as it can be implemented the length and breadth of the European Union . #% The British Conservatives , incidentally , are playing a weak hand on law and order in opposing the European arrest warrant . #% This is of course a political judgement . #% Mr Coelho adopts a fully justified tone of impatience . #% On the particular issue of security of citizens , justice and migration , the EPLP supports the general position of the EP as well as the other institutions in the development of policy in this important field . #% If we do not do that , we are flying in the face of all the statements in this House , not least by the rapporteur 's party , that we should help small businesses . #% I have to take issue with the spokesman from the Committee on Budgets , who has totally misunderstood what this is all about . #% Mr President , I am voting in favour of this report today . #% The brevity of colleagues today has brought this debate forward slightly to the point where I was not quite expecting to be called to speak so early . #% There is a huge worry , certainly in the United Kingdom and , I am sure , across Europe about hormone beef coming into the European Union under a trade negotiation with the US . #% Let me also say to the Council of Europe that , although I fully understand its concerns , you can not have too many human rights ' defenders in the field of defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms . #% Finally , I am concerned that some of the proposals for changes in the veto system , the composition of the Security Council , or suggestions for an EU mandate prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and may not carry support in all of our countries . #% The UK also already ensures that any operations on UK soil are carried out with the full knowledge and consent of the UK government and are subject to UK law . #% It is extremely important that the Vienna summit meeting send a strong signal that Europe intends to play its part in helping to bring stability to the global economy . #% Through extensive consultation with the Member States , business and consumer organisations , the Commission has looked at which legal instruments could best guarantee a high level of consumer protection whilst also removing barriers to the development of intra-Community trade . #% Leaving aside the monumental waste of public money , it will ensure that human rights become a permanent source of conflict across Member States as the bureaucrats seek to keep themselves busy . #% I am not entirely sure whether that includes cleaning staff , and I would welcome some clarification on that . #% This is about a common immigration and asylum policy and , however much the British Government may lie to the British people , we know that they intend that Britain should eventually be bound by it . #% Port owners tell me that over 600 new jobs at Felixstowe and over 750 new jobs at Harwich would all be threatened . #% Was it the Commission or was it an administrative decision ? #% I hope that the European Commission has the courage , and I mean courage , to accept the European Parliament amendments . #% Most people are looking forward to a good match and hope that it will be safe . #% Not surprisingly , this Parliament has not been invited to observe the elections , but the Conference of Presidents should authorise a budget for MEPs to attend via the OSCE . #% We all want to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced and my amendment is not a judgment on energy taxes , but it is seeking to help us make informed decisions on any proposals for such taxes . #% And credit must be given of course to the Spanish presidency for breaking the log-jam during their period in office . #% It is difficult to focus together on defining common strategic interests like , for example , the Ukraine . #% On specifics , first we have secured the inclusion of self-employed drivers as a matter of principle . #% The ministers will know that I do not say this just out of politeness because I have also voiced friendly criticism of some aspects of the Greek legal system . #% Obviously , it is necessary to apply stricter moneylaundering controls in situations of higher risk , but I hope this will also mean slimming down with a simplified due diligence , as it is called , when possible . #% Everything in the story was too little , too late . #% Finally , given that the effect of these anti-dumping duties has been to distort the market in the textile industry and the relationship between spinners , weavers and finishers and that European finishers have been put at a serious disadvantage by these anti-dumping duties , is there not a case for anti-dumping duties to be imposed throughout the textile industry and not in just one part of it ? #% As far as the environmental aspect of this report is concerned , this is something which concerns me very much as a representative of London , one of the major cities in the EU , obviously contending with car pollution all the time and always looking for ways of dealing with it . #% We could talk at length about Cyprus . #% Madam President , on behalf of the PSE I would like to thank Mr Funk for the very swift and efficient way in which he worked to produce both his reports on the proposals to safeguard farm incomes put in jeopardy as a result of consumer resistance to eating beef and veal following the statement admitting the possibility of a link between BSE in cows and CJD in humans . #% These new measures , in terms of labelling of detergents and ensuring that they break down into safe components when they are discharged in the water , are not quite enough . #% As the report points out , NEPAD was initially and consistently intellectually scarred by inadequate consultation , particularly at grassroots level -- it was leader-led . #% I want the human rights clause to be a more effective part of our association agreements , but I also want that in relation to the agreements which exist today , with Russia , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Morocco , Tunisia , Algeria and Israel . #% The US population is going to increase by 40 % . #% Most if not all of the Members here tonight are committed to developing that role and I pay tribute to a succession of rapporteurs who have tried to make a progressive contribution to the debate , including those here tonight . #% The Liberal and EPP resolution says that such a centre would try to interfere in the markets and in commercial decisions . #% I firmly support the Commission and the Council of Ministers and I believe that with EU backing and pressure , the World Trade Organization will act correctly and throw out the US position , and that President Bush will welcome this . #% Secondly , the paragraph is too diffuse . #% An excellent working relationship has already developed over the past months between Mr Söderman and myself , who at the moment hold the office of chair of the Committee on Petitions . #% But at least we managed to conduct the discussions in a very civilised manner . #% 
We also saw evidence of severe deprivation . #% You have just called a roll call vote and I automatically pressed the button . #% When one considers value for money , however , this must be considered not only in relative terms , i.e. whether one or another MEP provides more value than the other , but in comparative terms , in comparison with what else could be bought . #% Those gains could include tariff-free access for all goods from the poorest countries , the abolition of tariff peaks and agreements to stop export dumping . #% Here , however , we will be looking at the budget . #% The European Union produces millions of tonnes of animal by-products and these are separated into three categories according to the risk to humans or animals . #% It is extremely valuable to have these opportunities to review collectively how we are doing and how we can do better . #% In discussing further reform in the CAP , we must ensure that the accession countries are involved in an advisory capacity as soon as possible . #% No nation should be pouring taxpayers ' money into a corrupt system . #% The latest of these scares is of course that , if we do not cough up green taxes , we will all boil to death - reminiscent of the medieval religions , is it not , which played the same game : pay up or burn in hell . #% At the very time we are seeking these steps forward , the non-governmental organisations which play a leading part in sustaining and nurturing public , professional and political awareness of health issues are being faced with potentially damaging budget cuts . #% Of course we have not achieved everything that we in Parliament wanted ; as we know that is the nature of compromise . #% Think of the language difficulties for Members from the new countries . #% Even after that we will be working out a compromise at second reading with the Commission . #% Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his sentiments . #% There are a number of other things going on as well . #% He will be receiving an invitation from me to a meeting next week where I have been asked by the Industry Committee to convene a group of interested parliamentarians . #% It is its responsibility , as stated in Article 274 , to implement and oversee the Community 's budget . #% I would also like to pay tribute to my colleague , Mr Van Orden , who has been particularly active in this campaign . #% There is nothing so closed as a closed mind . #% 25 % of Britons do not know their country is in the EU . #% It would save the international community a lot of money to burn it and pay the farmers , instead of spending many billions of dollars fighting the drug trafficking trade . #% It is a great help but we have to do much more . #% It is good to hear that the Commission will be presenting something to Parliament in the second half of the year , but we hope that it will be sooner rather than later , and comprehensive in its coverage . #% . -- Mr President , 19 March marks the Belarus presidential election , in which there is still a chance that the country will assume its rightful place in the European family of democracies and conduct a free and fair election . #% The BSE crisis changed everything . #% We have consistently counselled against amendments that simply allow Parliament to meddle . #% Let us be clear . #% However , just in parenthesis , I will make the point , following on what my colleague , Karl von Wogau , has just said , that the question of the United Kingdom 's relationships with the European Monetary System and exchange rates is , of course , one for markets and not for governments . #% I was in Prague recently where there has been a 6 % fall in public support for joining the European Union just as a result of the debate over the Bene ? decrees . #% Mr President , I must confess when I hear phrases about Europe being overrun and overwhelmed it fills me with absolute horror about the quality of the debate in this Parliament . #% We have seen in today 's vote that the majority of this House prefers not to make clear statements on labour rights and the protection of public services . #% After all Turkey is responding to the demands that we placed upon her to bring her prisons more into line with European systems . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Nicholson , on his report . #% If we are to rebuild confidence in the multilateral system , we have to expend much more political capital in making its rules and procedures genuinely fair and sustainable . #% To close , I would like to ask two of those questions . #% Mr President , I should like to reiterate what Mr Bourlanges and Commissioner Liikanen have said about the way that we have had good cooperation with the Council on this occasion compared to last year for instance . #% What could the Council have to hide ? #% Although , thanks to the rapporteur , this is restricted to level 2 ( b ) , it is still one which will bring extra delay and bureaucracy to the very simple process of providing food to people who are hungry . #% All decent democratic states should use their relations with other countries -- diplomatic and trading , cultural , etc. -- to encourage the growth of democracy and human rights , something that my country , Britain , has done for many years . #% Our Parliament will be present at a crucial time for the review of the Human Rights Council , as the global fulcrum for respect of human rights , the universal periodic review of all UN members , the independence of its experts or so-called special procedures , and the enhanced role for civil society participation . #% As for the creation of a European Prosecutor : that might be your desired destination , but my advice is that if I were you , I would not start from here . #% The human rights situation continues to get worse , and so we urge the African Union and its Member States to exert every possible pressure on the FLN with a view to bringing them to the negotiating table in an attempt to seek a peaceful political settlement . #% The attempts of the French authorities to tighten security are welcome . #% Mr President , I agree with what Mr Soulier has just said . #% However , it is inappropriate to talk of an EU seat in paragraph 19 , as the UN Charter does not allow for organisations such as the EU to become members . #% Mr President , last night the Working Group of Parliament set up by the Conference of Presidents voted very narrowly to send two contradictory reports to the Conference of Presidents on the issue of EU funding to the Palestinian Authority . #% Doubly unfortunately , the vote was lost by 11 votes to 8 . #% Kazakhstan lies between Russia and China and near to Iran and politically unstable Afghanistan . #% I am glad to hear , Commissioner , that you are now taking action , but quite frankly it is a little late for the workers at Forest . #% I actually have some sympathy for that , in so far as we are in new territory and new plans need to be made . #% In our global marketplace , the use of internationally recognised labels or marks , which conscientious consumers can have confidence in , is a logical and significant contribution to economic and social improvements across the globe . #% That was quickly followed by successive discussions and arguments with the Council about how to fund Serbia , Afghanistan , the notorious fisheries agreement , and even this year we had the problem of Category 5 and how we were going to fund the administration expenditure that was needed . #% If it would help you , I have a copy of that instruction myself and I will pass it on to you . #% The suggested procedures for ECHO are extraordinarily complicated and will deter the speedy and effective action that ECHO so often needs to take . #% And why , when it does happen , do so many fail ? #% I have no doubt that this particular report is well meant but the creation of a European learning area and the prospect of yet more taxpayers ' money being filtered through the EU into universities is a recipe for even more political interference . #% But what is peculiar about the European Union 's system is that during all those years when the Council alone acted as the legislative authority , it was willing to delegate implementing measures to the Commission only on condition that a committee of national civil servants would work with the Commission . #% Young Tamil men in particular can find themselves being a victim of violent coercion by the Tamil Tigers and violent interrogation by the security services . #% But I can not get in and out of the hemicycle without encountering cigarettes . #% There is perhaps a slight risk -- how do we know ? #% The Commission must specify more precisely what outcomes are required . #% Mr President , I am pleased that both the President-in-Office and Commissioner Verheugen stressed that the Kok report is not an end-point but a starting point for the mid-term review of Lisbon to be concluded at next year 's spring summit . #% He is doing a magnificent job but to paraphrase Winston Churchill : Give him the tools so he can carry on functioning as an agency head and not with one hand tied behind his back . #% The directive would have assessed the hospitals ' boilers on the basis of their potential emissions , rather than their actual emissions - thus causing them to incur substantial costs to obtain a permit . #% I would like to know whether all workers have been consulted . #% 
So somebody should tell Tony Blair not to get too upset if he does not get it ! #% It is one of the greenest ways of generating power anywhere in the world . #% The Council of Ministers does not want a committee of inquiry , as there are probably too many skeletons in its cupboard for that . #% Following what the Commission is up to is always slightly difficult unless one is a true initiate of the workings of the European political system . #% I do not wish to delay matters . #% Member States participated in illegal CIA rendition , torture and disappearance , and there was a lack of oversight and accountability . #% It is very good to see you in the Chair . #% I say that , not because I am scarcely an enthusiast for a European foreign policy , but because I believe that at this present time in Israel we are in a very difficult situation . #% It is a difficult week with lower attendance in the plenary . #% I agree with the Commissioner that is important that Marco Polo does not lose sight of its main objective , which is to encourage modal shift . #% We can do nothing more in the circumstances than continue to strive to meet the best standards which we heartily recommend to others throughout the European Union . #% Having said all that , when it comes to SAB4 the speed with which the institutions have worked has been quite commendable . #% Nobody can doubt the drastic measures that have had to be used to curtail it . #% I have to also say that it is grossly insensitive of the Commission to make this ludicrous and expensive proposal for unnecessary cultural attachés at a time of universal economic hardship . #% Parliament and the Commission have long recognised that legislative planning is a matter of common concern . #% I understand that there is now to be no debate on the Malliori report . #% Mr President , it was significant that when the President of the Commission spoke to us this morning he talked about the Russian crisis and not the overall problem that we face in the global economy . #% In Kosovo we learned that while we spend 60 % of what the Americans spend , we only get 10 % of their power projection . #% These include the implementation of the early retirement scheme . #% Nevertheless , so far in the campaign , there have been widespread allegations of bias by the authorities against the opposition front-runner , Mr Yushchenko , ranging from the use of administrative resources dedicated to backing the incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych as a presidential candidate , to bizarre allegations of KGB-style poisoning with ricin . #% However , the principal reason why the Commission is championing linguistic diversity is not any deep-seated fear that languages and cultures are being eroded , but the knowledge that their ultimate objective , a European federal superstate , is not possible until people can move only to be employable where the jobs are available . #% Madam President , you will know that the City of Strasbourg is twinned with the City of Leicester , my home city . #% That is the least we could do for the people of Galicia and other affected areas . #% This positive vote today is part of that process . #% We believe , therefore , that there should be a fundamental assessment of the institutional capacity of the Union to absorb Turkey and that this should be part of the Commission 's report in October . #% I agree with almost everything that Daniel Cohn-Bendit has said today , which makes me a bit worried . #% Would he work with the European Parliament so that we can get a better engagement , both of European and national parliamentarians , as part of the Tunis agenda and in the run-up to Tunis ? #% We are not offering the European Commission a blank cheque , Mr Prodi ; we will be watching very carefully what you and your colleagues do . #% As a young lawyer in London in the early 1980s , I was privileged to work with a then elderly German lady , who was one of those remarkable German-Jewish immigrés who came to London in the early war years and entered the English legal profession . #% in writing . - The Member States of the ECR have signed the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Beijing Platform for Action . #% Finally , as I said previously , this is about informed choice as opposed to enforced ignorance . #% We might well need to look at a directive in the future but it may be premature to decide now whether a directive is necessary . #% The UK has problems , mainly political and not economic , which I am sure will be sorted out with a change of government and we will then see the UK ready to move to stage 3 under a socialist government . #% The European chemicals industry has been consulted far too late , and its attempts at self-regulation ( e.g. Product Stewardship , the Long Range Research Initiative and `` Confidence in Chemicals '' ) have been completely ignored by the rapporteur in this report . #% Over the border in Afghanistan , I have seen no water projects at all on the ground . #% Most recently , a video apparently showing British troops beating up Iraqi youths was revealed yesterday . #% It seems now that there might be some possibility of redeploying funds from the MEDA programme to help solve our problem . #% It is the overall balance of the membership 's views which is important . #% Yesterday in Warsaw NATO Foreign Ministers welcomed proposals for a NATO military response force . #% In my view , these amendments will make the directive far more workable and more acceptable to temporary workers , agencies and user companies . #% We still enjoy the presumption of innocence , protection of trial by jury and freedom from double jeopardy , despite the disgraceful efforts of the Blair Government to fall into line with what the EU chooses to call law . #% Companies are increasingly being expected to behave in an ethical and socially responsible manner . #% While such claims can be made , obviously we in this Parliament will look rather ludicrous . #% Travelling to Strasbourg is expensive and the increased travel causes extra CO2 emissions . #% However , although Fair Trade is growing in many places , it is much less developed in some Member States than others . #% It is the first common framework for the three institutions which recognises the citizen 's rights so that the citizen no longer relies on the goodwill of each Institution . #% NHS hospitals need to have a significant amount of spare boiler capacity to cope with emergencies and in case there are technical failures . #% However , we must not make too many demands upon the agency or it will fail in the beginning . #% Commissioner Patten is absolutely right to say that the European Union has got its act together to a considerable extent in the Balkans . #% I would like to thank medical staff at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge and at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital , both of which are in my constituency , who have given me help and advice so that I could contribute to this directive . #% I do not accept that the purpose of a common defence policy is to protect the Union 's interests in all areas , including security of supply . #% Mr President , Mr Pimenta was the author of this resolution in the Environment Committee . #% This directive tries to reconcile very different national approaches to allowing these products onto the markets and it fails in that attempt at reconciliation . #% There is none ; our double standards are just rank . #% It is also very necessary to ensure that such European pathways are open to all groups and that there is real equality of opportunity built in . #% Those rules apply both to donors in the United Kingdom and to donors supplying anyone in the United Kingdom . #% In the French referendum President Chirac got 45.3 per cent of votes in favour . #% Secondly we must renew and reinvigorate security screening at airports and thirdly we must assist with the costs of security and war-risk insurance . #% We would like to see people cooperating closely to avoid duplication for example , the Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living Conditions . #% But if Leyla Zana , ten years a political prisoner , came as she did two months ago to this Parliament saying that the promotion of human rights requires us to open the talks , who in this Chamber can with any credibility use human rights objections to support the rejection of Turkey ? #% As she knows , this idea was rejected in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , in favour of the framework approach of the Commission on the basis of river-basin management . #% Thirdly , the implications of such systems for individuals are not clear . #% We therefore support EU action to agree minimum technical standards to permit interoperability of tolling technology , so as to avoid vehicle owners having to install a number of separate units , with obvious consequences regarding cost and inconvenience . #% Apart from Hong Kong 's economic success , the territory has a reputation for a fair legal system and respect for individual human rights . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the United Kingdom Presidency for coming here to make this important statement . #% We emphasise that , half way through the period up to 2010 , there should be a thorough audit and investigation of what has been achieved . #% 
We are actually discussing here a Commission proposal to increase payments to tobacco producers in four of the richest countries in the European Union , allegedly because they produce better quality tobacco . #% Experience in other areas such as telecom shows that Member States respond better to this incentive and I hope that the Commission will elaborate a specific timetable for liberalization in the months to come . #% I would like to see , for example , a recognition of the interdependence between these areas of policy . #% That was reinforced by Mr Verhofstadt , who comes from Belgium and who thinks all nation states should be abolished - well , perhaps his own will be very shortly . #% This is a matter of some sensitivity , especially since there are certain parties represented in this House that might regard themselves , for some reason , as ineligible for such funding , even if they approved of the funding in the first place . #% But our main message has got to be , quite frankly , that we have to recognise that the hand-over of power has gone very well . #% Indeed , if your dream is to change the minds of the people of the European Union , it is a ` must do better ' . #% Until there is evidence of real change , the restrictive measures specifically targeting Mugabe and his close allies must remain in place . #% Let us be clear and honest here : the underlying goal is to put in place footings for a pan-European justice system which will undoubtedly undermine British law . #% Mr Miller has played the role of the man riding the last dinosaur , if I may put it that way . #% It is a great pity that the Committee on Budgets takes one forward look at the budget , but then encounters budgetary control implications , and there is a bit of a gap between the two . #% Whatever happens this year , you can not expect discharge for 2001 unless they are fulfilled . #% We do , however , have a problem in terms of its disposal where harm to the environment can be caused by inappropriate disposal and we need to take sensible action with regard to that . #% We have talked in broad terms of the importance of this report and the importance of the global effects it might have . #% What does that tell us ? #% In 1992 , if I remember correctly , it covered 1.1 % GDP and is now under 1 % GDP , with savings in the running of the agriculture budget , for example . #% Indeed the dream that should drive us is the dream of reuniting Europe . #% it makes no mention of the need for good governance , nor of the fact that corrupt governments in failed states are often the prime source of human rights abuse ; #% The question is , how do we deal with it ? #% It is absurd to propose to cut accidents on the roads by 50 % in 8 years and yet cut the budget in that key area . #% The PPE-DE and PSE Groups used to support the lighter procedure and I trust that their spokesmen will be able to enlighten us as to why they now seem to have changed their minds . #% Mr D'Alema 's request would , in my view , be surrendering to terrorism . #% It reminded me of the time when I used to have to get to a 10 a.m. division in the House of Commons and narrowly make it in , practising my side-step around the policemen . #% I hope no one will leave this debate with the idea that we are thoughtlessly and discourteously abandoning these critical information outlets , or the people who provide that service , to their fate . #% After all , what has the industry to hide ? #% There is a need , for instance , in hospitals , to protect the food of some very vulnerable patients from dangerous bacteria . #% It is only right that in Denmark we are seeing a debate on political union at the moment , as the Danes decide whether to join the euro or not . #% I welcome also the call for minimum social clauses in trade agreements to protect the rights of children , prisoners or to combat other forms of slave labour . #% If we had a European ` binding ' target on energy efficiency , I am sure that we would see that kind of action being taken in Member States very quickly , because they would realise that one of the easiest ways to achieve an energy efficiency target is by systematically upgrading existing buildings . #% Refugees must be allowed to return on terms which enable them to resettle , preferably those of the 20-point economic package . #% It does not matter whether they reform or not , they are joining -- the political decision has been made already . #% I would have thought that anything like this would automatically have got unanimity in committee . #% Yet there is no doubt at all that there is a lot of scope for improving the efficiency and delivery of water services . #% The provision of knowledge to empower and innovate was not catered for at a national level . #% Madam President , I want to comment on both of the Commissioner 's statements . #% The real issue here is the farce whereby ships are allowed to sail under flags of a country with which they have no connection at all . #% I had an asthma attack just before I was due to speak . #% It is an amendment which refers to the supplementary and amending budget No 1 of 1998 . #% We have the right to call upon the Commission to make proposals already given to us in the Treaty . #% All over Europe we are seeing rural areas getting poorer and losing vitality and urban areas getting richer . #% I thank Mr Diamandouros and the House for listening so politely . #% Four of the major manufacturers of electrical goods , including our chief lobbyist , Electrolux , have teamed up to develop a common approach to waste management which aims to be both innovative and cost efficient . #% The other controversial issue involves right in rem and the difference between the common position and the tidying up operation that Mrs Peijs has done , and this is something we have discussed at length . #% Then we saw the awful reprisals in which Zakibian , a town of 20 000 people , was destroyed and over 200 people killed . #% EU entry for Poland and the Baltic states will not happen overnight . #% It should have been settled a long time ago . #% Peace has broken out with the agencies . #% I hear that , sadly , the UK Government is trying to wriggle out of the intended requirement to prevent producers from making their reuse difficult by claiming that these products are consumables . #% The Commission document is slightly less strong but still says ` yes , let us make things better ' . #% And what about interoperability in the rail sector ? #% Yet lessons were not learned . #% I was very interested , Commissioner , to hear that you have met Members and officials from the National Assembly of Wales and I wondered whether you had been given any idea of the timescales that are envisaged before any suggestions for programmes are made . #% Mr President , in response to the barracking , it was not my wish to make an oral amendment , but we have come to a compromise and it seems to be sticking as far as the vote this morning is concerned . #% So , the bizarre effect is that couples get greater protection of their right to family life in an EU country other than their own . #% However , there is nothing in Article 286 of the EC Treaty or in the Data Protection Directive to suggest that data protection rules should be applied as a general principle of confidentiality in public administrations so as to require a public balancing exercise whenever a document mentions a name . #% The Council presidency has confirmed its intention of presenting a global compromise before the ` conclave ' meeting in Naples . #% I would urge colleagues not to follow him on the substance , although he is right on the procedure . #% Now your beloved euro has failed ; it has failed politically at its first major hurdle . #% These have the potential to have damaging effects on some of the poorest ACP countries who are simply not ready to open their markets to the EU and who do not have the negotiating capacity to engage not only in this process and the WTO process but also in the process of their own regional cooperation agreements . #% Thirdly , there is the area of cooperation , of exchange of good practice on tackling health determinants . #% Again , in the Commission text , the Council deleted that reference . #% Those amendments failed but I am concerned that the amendment which did go through on Article 2 ( 2 ) ( c ) might limit the scope too much . #% The Commission does not have a police force , and I recognise the attempts being made by the Commissioner to try and introduce a system that is more capable of being enforced . #% Some are neglected because western drugs are not made available or affordable . #% This means that our research and technology institutions and our universities need to be involved in developing this new software if we are to stay in competition . #% They have both outlined that we are now thinking of a Union which will be extended to at least 25 countries . #% 
It is clear that the changes we have introduced on transparency and registration are improvements that everyone in this House can live with . #% We support instead an Executive Board of nine members , as Mr Friedrich has mentioned , taking operational decisions , plus a wider Governing Council that would involve all Member States ' central bank governors in strategic decisions , such as the definition of price stability , and the emphasis on other objectives , such as monetary reference values . #% One of the problems we have had in agriculture - not as a result of Mr Cunha 's report but as a result of BSE - is that we have had to see vast changes in our approach to agriculture . #% Earlier this week Mr Blair said the crisis is about the failure of leaders to reach agreement with the people who see the world changing , and who want answers to the challenges they face . #% I actually agree with the Council on this and would remind not only Mr Poettering , but also Commissioner Bolkestein , of the position Parliament took at its first reading on postal services a couple of months ago . #% Secondly , the European Council must avoid a scramble to be at the end of the list -- . #% That is why I very much welcome the pressure that the Commissioner is putting on these countries . #% We must urge all Member States to educate our own citizens much more fully as to the benefits and positive advantages of having an integrated society . #% Mr President , as this will probably be the last time that I will speak in a debate on the environment to which Mrs Wallström will respond , I should like to thank her for her commitment and efforts over the past five years . #% This year Parliament voted EUR 3 million for Euronews . #% In those sectors that are the concern of the Environment Committee I particularly welcome the establishment of frameworks and long-term funding regimes which have certainly stabilised our work in the area of consumers . #% We know that there is disagreement on the Support Office , but , like the Socialists , we would welcome the opportunity to hear the Commission to spell out its intentions in that regard in order to see whether we want to move ahead with that proposal . #% Could you tell us who will be responsible for the coordinating machinery ? #% I suspect the answer is somewhere around the first and second options , but we are not at this stage dealing with the legislative proposal . #% We knew there was a problem ; they knew there was a problem . #% I am a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee with Poland . #% I can not understand why they are going to have a monopoly of supply . #% We must combat discrimination and poverty . #% We are reassuringly told , including by the Commission President , that the changes need only be limited , but that does not appear to be what the German Government believes . #% Having said that , I thank the rapporteur for accommodating some amendments in committee and I confirm that I am still willing to vote in favour of his whole report , despite my serious concerns , if the PPE-DE Group supports two of my amendments , in particular Amendments Nos 1 and 3 , as we have already discussed . #% I hope that in future we will be able to reinforce that and see civil justice as a thread that runs through many of the issues that we deal with in the internal market . #% Is it true that children were seen with ballot papers ? #% Is this a discharge issue ? #% However , if it takes a Member State over 20 years to implement a directive , and a Member State can carry on without doing that for such a long period of time , then common sense tells us that something is not right . #% We can only hope sanity returns to these negotiations so important and so vital for so many ! #% I urge every Member of this Parliament to acknowledge the horrendous impact this would have and encourage them to join me in opposing any such proposals every step of the way . #% I hope other nationals will forgive me if I mention only other British colleagues , for a reason that will become apparent . #% However , we have to make it clear to the government of Iran that we will be watching the outcome of this and similar cases with close interest , in terms of our future relations with that country . #% It appears that we can not reject the whole proposal , but I appeal to colleagues to support amendments which would soften it and to reject amendments which would make it even more disastrous than it already is . #% It is these individuals ' right to self-determination which must be secured . #% As to the question of the presidency , no debate could be complete without considering whether it would be the proper thing , in the end , to let the Commission chair the ordinary meetings of the Council , while letting Mr Solana chair the Foreign Affairs Council , preserving the routine six-month circus for the European Council itself . #% It is not complete -- and I disagree with Mr Elles , we be moving forward in relation to Romania , Bulgaria and Turkey -- but it is a Europe-wide EU . #% Previously , financial market worries have been a serious constraint on governments . #% Has the Commission got its organisation and priorities right on information policy ? #% When asked which products fall into this category , 27 % specifically noted Fair Trade products . #% So when I read in the Stockholm conclusions that the Council wishes to work with Parliament , I welcome this . #% The report highlights that the EIDHR was created at Parliament 's initiative , and that Parliament has used its budgetary powers to increase substantially the resources earmarked for the protection of human rights and democracy . #% I take the Commissioner 's point that , if our involvement is included in terms of the adoption of the clause in trade and other agreements , it is not formally included in terms of the implementation of the clause . #% This can be best achieved by the introduction , where appropriate and where there is local support , of charging schemes . #% Priority actions for children must be promoted when the European Commission negotiates the country strategy papers ' regional and thematic strategies , when they are drawn up , and subsequently when they are reviewed . #% Then they gave 27 people total unlimited power . #% We should remind Saddam Hussein that he must honour his obligations to the international community and we shall then honour our obligations to Iraq . #% Mr President , I should like to apologise for coming in late ; this debate has proceeded rather quickly but I have listened to what the Commissioner said elsewhere . #% This is their right , their duty , and I can assure you they are fulfilling it correctly . #% We have drafted a new financial regulation which came to this House on time and to the Council on time and we are waiting for its enactment . #% In this context , I refer to Amendments Nos 1 - 6 , 12 , 13 and 16 , all of which seek to extend the field of application of the proposed regulation and require the participation of all European institutions and of Parliament 's temporary staff in the early retirement scheme . #% That would allow us to go forward more speedily . #% This work should increasingly see the light of day and I hope that our involvement will assist that process . #% However , it does not deliver legal certainty and the Chairman of the Article 29 Working Party has contested the assertion by the Commission that EU data protection authorities may not find it necessary to take enforcement actions - that is for breaches of the Data Protection Directive - against airlines complying with the US requirements . #% For example , he was alleged to have entered the country illegally and yet British embassy staff have seen his passport , which is stamped with a Burmese immigration stamp showing that he had arrived completely legally . #% We should at the very least expand it by the amendments to this effect . #% Many pieces of chemical legislation have taken too long to be properly implemented in the past . #% I feel a personal worry about the over-concentration of these firms into too few hands . #% She clearly thinks that change is a bad thing . #% We know , in fact - and I spoke to NGOs in South Africa only yesterday - that the first provisional decisions concerning expenditure in the 1996 budgets were only taken this month . #% I wonder if the Commission 's recruitment and retirement procedures reflect this priority ? #% Only a few years ago it was nothing more than an arbitrary shopping list of legislative and non-legislative proposals . #% If there was a delay in appointing a rapporteur it is because the representative of the radicals at the meeting of the coordinators to agree a rapporteur asked for it to be postponed . #% Surely that has been one of the most encouraging events in recent history . #% The sooner we realise that the better . #% As the Commission report makes clear , Croatia has also made some substantial progress in meeting the negotiating benchmarks , and the country 's commitment to the EU 's expectations remains strong . #% All I can do now is to promise to strive for it . #% Successive Sri Lankan Governments have sought to improve the situation of the Tamils and have offered various devolutionary proposals that would give the Tamil population considerable autonomy , while preserving the unity of the country . #% The IGC needs to come to a conclusion . #% I hope that is now acceptable to Parliament . #% The House will be only too aware of the sophisticated skills of international criminals in taking advantage of different legal and regulatory provisions across the globe and infiltrating economic and financial systems regardless of national frontiers . #% 
All the evidence is that it will continue to go from strength to strength . #% Mrs Myller is in no way to be criticised as she has striven very hard to begin the discussion on the substance of this debate very early on , but that has not stopped some of her colleagues from coming forward with a long last-minute shopping list of demands stretching far into the future . #% Madam President , I have a point of order relating to the Nassauer report . #% Young people should be put into education and adults given the opportunity to work as quickly as possible , so they can be seen as active and useful participants in society . #% What we ask now is for you , Commissioner , to give this House , as soon as possible , a definitive answer as to whether the Hungarian constitution is in line with European legislation and fundamental rights . #% Mr President , I should like to say to the Commissioner that this has gone on for far too long . #% I hope that if this Parliament votes to have a much more general definition tomorrow , combined with the views of the European Commission , then the Ecofin Council will ensure that it does not have a prescriptive definition when it comes to some of these issues associated with the stability pact . #% The EU must be accountable for all of its development assistance and , together with the ACP , must set clear goals that boost ACP competitiveness and growth . #% In the control directive there is already a way of making sure that the manufacturers are compelled to say in terms of what goes into the chocolate where the 5 % is and what the ingredients are . #% Mr President , many of us on this side of the House are very supportive of Turkey 's EU membership . #% My recommendation to our group would be that we do not support the amendments but we stick by the report unamended . #% Emissions out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean do not cause us problems on land . #% Yet when the same European leaders come together in an EU context some strange mental transformation takes place and they seem to speak an altogether different language . #% This year , it is GBP 6 billion . #% We will continue to argue for a European Union fit for the purposes of the future , not the past , and for a European Union which rests securely on the support of its peoples and not only the priorities of any elite . #% On the contrary , I would support those who have said that not only did they have a coherent delegation to lead but that the practical arrangements for us - the largest Parliamentary delegation which had ever attended international trade talks - were to our mutual benefit . #% We need to rekindle the Delors spirit of 1992 and ensure by the end of the century that a true single market is done and dusted . #% I do not agree that we need a pharmaceutical industry with price controls as they are at the moment , but this is an important contribution to a key-sector policy development . #% I am pleased a number of colleagues , including Mr Glante , made that point as well . #% It gives a passport to pension funds to operate throughout the EU without trying to harmonise everything . #% Would you consider , for example , hearings held here in the European Parliament to choose the directors of those agencies ? #% This is therefore an important issue . #% While we recognise the need to be able to identify and isolate all those producers and feed businesses involved in the food production chain , I believe this should be done without adding another tier of registration . #% We should look objectively and calmly at what happened at Parmalat and see what response is necessary so as to avoid any hasty or knee-jerk reactions , because it is difficult to see how changing the scheme or regulation for rating agencies could have prevented the Parmalat scandal . #% It says that , in a rape trial , it takes four male witnesses to convict a man but the testimony of a female is not accepted , not even that of the raped woman . #% I come from a region in the United Kingdom with the highest density of pigs . #% We face the prospect of the extinction of many shark species -- slow-breathing creatures that have lived on this planet for many millennia longer than our own species . #% What Objective 2 funding we had has been reduced by the present government and the Conver Fund that used to be very helpful is now being phased out . #% I would like to contribute to this debate by making three remarks of the following nature - general , specific and political . #% Understanding the market dynamics and equipping regulators with instruments plus information/data is vital . #% I salute your determination to pursue a policy of inclusion across Europe . #% As a maiden vice-presidential speaker , I am in that position again in my life . #% His answer does not address that issue . #% All of us , the EU institutions and the Member States themselves have an important role to play in ensuring that our citizens regain confidence in the European Union . #% In November last year the worst repression of all followed an attack on him . #% Mr President , yesterday we welcomed a number of unemployed people into the Parliament who were walking from Switzerland to Amsterdam . #% If we want genuine equality , then individual European States must not recognise Sharia law in any way , shape or form . #% It is also right that the EU should monitor the arms trade and press for a binding code of conduct so that the EU at least is not sustaining regimes which infringe the civil liberties of their own people . #% If we are to invest further in the Russian economy we have to find the means to support and develop local economic activity - as our colleague has just said - which meets people ' s needs and provides a sense of stability and involvement . #% Early years intervention can make all the difference to children 's life chances , not only as they go through the educational system , but also later on in life . #% After the Barrot affair , I know there is a great desire to stop discussing any difficulties there may be with this Commission but , given that I got that one right , I would like to think that Mr Borrell will take the letter that I hand-delivered to him a couple of weeks ago rather more seriously . #% Every year , thousands of people drive across the continent on holiday . #% Mr President , the Laeken Declaration rightly called for the EU institutions to develop in a way which brought them closer to the people . #% But it should be done on an open and consistent basis . #% It would be morally wrong to remove or reduce the support that we offer to people when , for whatever reason , they are in need , be it as a result of age , disability , health or unemployment . #% The first point I would like to make - and this has been alluded to by my friend and colleague , Mr Cushnahan - is that Hong Kong can not pass law under its constitution if it contravenes the international standards of human rights . #% How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster ? #% He worked tirelessly right up to the end to make sure that we could get the cooperation between the Council and Parliament that we need to get the budget we all want in the year 2000 . #% Thank you very much indeed . #% To MEPs such as myself , the ECB ' s annual and monthly publications have proved to be invaluable and of a consistently high standard . #% Frankly , companies in the European Union , such as Total , have blood on their hands because they are supporting this repressive regime . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mrs McCarthy on her excellent report and also on the research that has gone into it . #% Commissioner Patten made a very cogent case setting out the dangers of unilateral action ; there is very little I can disagree with . #% Parliament wants the legal base for pilot initiatives on decentralized cooperation to be a strong - not a weak - instrument and one which is a starting point for mainstreaming this philosophy as a defining element in all of the EU 's development cooperation efforts . #% That being so , we have been very careful and have made use of good advice on including wording which would enable good existing systems to qualify under the regulation without the need to establish whole new structures . #% Even the Spanish Government 's own Environment Minister suggested that some of the fires could have been started by forestry workers angry at not being drafted over the summer by the regional firefighting brigades . #% With this proposal , you are travelling down a very slippery slope . #% That is where we should all start . #% I thank the President-in-Office for that answer . #% This has to happen , because you need a diversion . #% I want to deal with some of issues in my short address . #% It is not seen as focusing on the big issues . #% . Mr President , my group views with concern the proliferation of agencies in recent years . #% We look forward to the declarations of the Council and the Commission . #% We must ensure that we get global certainties and agreements for the future and not re-fight old battles . #% In the accession treaties there is a JHA safeguard clause , but it is focused exclusively on monitoring implementation of mutual recognition measures and framework decisions in criminal law . #% 
The issue of asylum , immigration and cross-border crime and the administration of justice impact on the very fundamental issues of human rights and individual civil liberties . #% Amendment No 43 would ban the import of such literally life-saving plasma and I urge the support of this House for the rapporteur ' s compromise amendment . #% There are surprisingly few areas which have been subject to the SLIM process and it is not always clear why those particular areas have been selected . #% When we go into conciliation - as I expect we will because we will have the votes for many of these amendments in the House - we are going to have to think very carefully about whether we continue to adopt this type of approach and this type of legislation . #% Finally , as regards Amendment No 2 in the name of my Group , this is purely a drafting amendment to remove references to the codecision procedure . #% That , in my view , certainly puts him into a top category and I wish him the very best for the future . #% This is the last opportunity I therefore have on behalf of the House to ask the Presidency to make one final point clear . #% However , one of the things I regret is that global target 8 is not strong enough to ensure that countries like New Zealand , Australia , Canada or Italy are not let off the hook and to keep pressure on them to do the same as the European Union has done . #% We give money to the KEDO project as Mr Patten has said , we give humanitarian and food aid and are hoping to give other structural assistance , a total of EUR 275 m . #% I believe that it was right for our committee to go further than the Commission , after the abolition of the 25 % rule , by also taking an axe to some of the exceptions and exemptions which had been suggested by the Commission . #% He is one of at least 72 British lorry drivers stranded in Salonika by the blockade mounted by Greek farmers . #% We , on this side of the House , reject that position completely . #% That was the objective of the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which we held in abeyance pending the judgment of the Court . #% His claims have been refuted by the airlines . #% We condemn any interference in the decisions of the judiciary in a Member State governed by the rule of law . #% We ourselves , as a parliament , interpreted the right to give discharge to mean that we also had a right to refuse discharge . #% It is our hope and expectation also that the Committee on Petitions will automatically be asked for an opinion in good time on such issues in future . #% I understand that there has been no consultation at all on the employment effects that these subsidies will have . #% This is all so bad that it is really very good because the genie of public opinion is now firmly out of the bottle . #% The EU , as Israel 's principal trading partner , is in a unique position to utilise the human rights clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement and bring pressure to bear on the Israeli Government to comply , specifically with the ICJ opinion , and more generally to ensure that disengagement is followed by credible political process where outstanding claims for justice under international humanitarian law are resolved . #% If we do not sell enlargement we are likely to run into difficulties with ratification . #% We should not exclude this possibility , particularly if at the end of next year the Commission sanctions the much weaker case - to my mind - for Turkey 's membership . #% Hopefully , common sense will prevail at Member State level , as it has so far . #% On the question of the preamble , I quite agree and I will accept Amendment 7 . #% I hope that will end . #% I only have enough speaking time to raise two issues . #% I strongly agree with the proposal to limit the level of alcohol to 0.5 mg/ml , along with proposals to ban the sale of alcohol in service stations and the standardization of the apparatus of breathalysers . #% We have to recognise that in the absence of any agreement , the Americans will do quite legally what they have done in other instances : they will say to every passenger travelling to the United States of America , ` we wish you to sign a data waiver , i.e. that your data can be transferred to the United States ' . #% I want to pick out some examples , such as the treatment of the Roma people . #% However , British Conservatives and other colleagues in the PPE-DE Group think that it centralises more powers , makes the institutions more remote and reduces the powers of nation-states . #% I have two points to make to the President . #% When the interinstitutional agreement was agreed , the flexibility instrument was one of the items which was reluctantly agreed by both sides - reluctantly from our side because there was a lot of resistance to the IIA anyway . #% I declare an interest in this in that I am an automotive engineer and I have driven some of the cars with that technology . #% My group will be supporting this with the amendments to which I have just referred . #% As anyone working in the home can tell you , ladders are used very commonly and very frequently and , yes , there are accidents but I do not believe this kind of directive will ever eliminate those accidents . #% The governments of France and the Irish Republic have also joined the campaign as of that date . #% I do not plead for us to depart from that . #% I am concerned about the environmental hazards in the far north and I strongly urge the Russians to sign the MNEPR Agreement , as they have agreed to do , on joint action for decommissioning of their spent nuclear fuel rods and warheads rotting in their naval submarines which might contaminate the Murmansk area . #% For me , a major stumbling block has been the WTO . #% Does national democracy matter , or is the European Union , in your opinion , a greater good ? #% We must defend freedom of thought and freedom of conscience . #% In order for competition to flourish and for benefits to flow from it in terms of better service to consumers , greater efficiency as regards both energy and market forces , enhanced security of supply , greater flexibility and increased innovation , there must be a clear regulatory framework . #% Members here have celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall - and rightly so . #% This is something we clearly support in the Socialist Group , but I am not entirely sure that commitment is accompanied either by the political resources - which is one of the reasons we are asking for the campaign to encourage and foster renewable energy - or , more importantly , by the financial resources . #% Peace and development in the areas of the world facing crisis are also what we must strive for . #% However , I take little comfort from this . #% We have to remember that for evil to thrive it only takes good men and women to remain silent . #% As for the answers , they are top secret . #% It is also clear that arms export policy in relation to security is becoming more closely aligned . #% Therefore , before we even think of passing more powers to the European Union , we must take into account its past activities and failures . #% We are very remiss about disabled people 's rights in this Parliament in terms of access . #% It would be futile in that the culprits are elsewhere and go further back in time . #% I note that Mr Holmes is leader of the UK Independence Party . #% But there is room for compromise , efficiency and a voluntary initiative . #% The European Union must do all it can to encourage and promote Hungary 's accession to the Union and participation in these programmes in advance of membership is a very important step forward . #% Others in this House do not seem to have been listening . #% I should like to elaborate on the point which my colleague Nirj Deva mentioned . #% I would like an answer . #% It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class , and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners . #% That is not our understanding of parliamentary democracy . #% The purpose , apparently , of the Nice Treaty was to provide for the enlargement of the European Union to include the new democracies . #% What the EU can and should do is to offer the exchange of best practice , to benchmark performance , to encourage uniformly high standards of care . #% I hope that it will be a proper Convention , and that the next Intergovernmental Conference is not prepared by the usual small group of foreign policy advisers , but by a wider representative body . #% Hopefully it will be possible to avoid any recurrence of such events and the country will be able to achieve an improved level of economic growth in future . #% We are well aware that fishing is one of the most dangerous professions in the world . #% I say to Mr Martin that I was surprised that the PSE Group tabled so many amendments , particularly to the resolution . #% 
It is unacceptable that Parliament 's Bureau seems to have gone totally AWOL and decided for itself : under pressure from Parliament 's administration , Parliament 's Bureau has chosen to ignore what this Parliament has voted for . #% The Egyptian press law prohibits the publication of details in on-going investigations which might prejudice the trial outcome , which was blatantly disregarded with the publications of stories of alleged homosexual orgies , gay weddings and the identity and pictures of all the defendants . #% The Commissioner mentioned the essential sector of textiles for developing countries . #% So we expect the industry to take the prime responsibility for learning lessons , rather than relying on the regulator to tell it what to do . #% But the choices are not simple . #% I wonder how long it will be before we are discussing a defence budget of EUR 10 billion or more . #% Can I ask you to correct an inaccuracy there : it says that Question No 51 by my colleague , Mr Bowe , fell as he was absent . #% I call on this Parliament to agree to a directive which will help starve the terrorists of funds . #% Indeed , the suggestions made in the study for more research and exchange of information and for innovative projects under Interreg looked to bring real practical benefits to all those whose lives are island ones . #% Third , after a strong fight for higher standards , Parliament 's delegation suddenly dropped all of its demands after the Council offered a minimal increase of one of the two standards of the sufficient category . #% Today we are left with an implementation plan with no less than 200 sets of brackets representing unresolved issues . #% We want our country back and , believe you me , we are going to get it . #% Respiratory health problems are Europe 's second biggest killer , accounting for one in four deaths . #% Similarly , the commitments of many countries to meeting contributions towards helping developing nations has to be driven forward at the conference . #% It would be a measure that would be inclusive , that would enable more Members to hold positions of responsibility , and that would make it easier to distribute such posts politically across Parliament . #% It is to those structures , which the decision now puts in place , that those citizens can confidently look for reassurance that the sort of killer diseases re-emerging to sometimes worrying degrees in other continents , as well as here , are less likely to strike them down . #% Firstly I understand that Prime Minister Jospin has said that he would rather see no agreement in December in Nice than an unsatisfactory institutional reform . #% Could the Commissioner tell us how that issue is going to be tackled ? #% The Scottish Fishermen 's Federation 's proposals for spatial management deserve serious consideration in this regard . #% To give you one vivid illustration , they denied that the Government or the equivalent department had any knowledge of problems with Equitable Life ten years before we knew -- and we have proof that they did . #% I should like to congratulate the Presidency and indeed those other countries within the Council that recognise the importance of retaining the opt-out . #% in writing . - This report provides for a framework to be established in order that Parliament can undertake its obligations under the Lisbon Treaty in regard to international air agreements . #% I strongly believe that this is a matter of public health . #% It is therefore essential that Tunisia 's political leaders - the new leaders that will now emerge - protect that legacy , because Salafist extremists will undoubtedly try to take advantage of the chaos and turmoil that will advance their dangerous agenda , which obviously also threatens European political objectives , including foreign policy objectives . #% It is quite clear that as consumers we have a very strong and authoritative voice on this issue . #% We must reject them as they stand . #% We also ask that those - or maybe it is that - Member State that has not solved the problem of continuing legal validity of existing direct debit mandates to get on with it and solve the problem . #% It is as if the EU has hijacked the IMF , that it is now there as part of the support mechanism for the euro , so that it is not just the taxpayers of the eurozone and the non-eurozone EU members , but the whole world that now has to help prop up the euro as the Greek problem compounds by the day . #% I hope that the Council - and not just the Luxembourg presidency , because I am sure you do understand it - appreciates how far Parliament has moved on this budget , not just in the sacrifices it has made , but also in the margins that exist . #% As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated . #% The London Boroughs of Hounslow , Ealing and Richmond have all benefited at some time and I am very pleased about that . #% I look forward to the day when this Union will not be supporting by way of subsidy the growing of a product that causes injury , harm , sickness and death . #% It is therefore tragic that the Commission and the Council have been so timid in getting to grips with the reality of the modern world for we are in a world which is moving away from that of national jurisdictions into the world of networks . #% After all , we are looking for effective and efficient legislation . #% It is precisely because the Commission is about to produce a communication on the future framework that will allow for action of the sort that he usefully introduced when , hopefully , Amsterdam is ratified , that we are able to develop these themes . #% It is deeply worrying that the opposition are fighting their campaign on Zanu-PF grounds . #% Five years after the UN programme of action was agreed , the forthcoming review conference must not just review : it must act . #% There is a mass campaign in the United Kingdom . #% The Council can not ignore these categories as though there were no problems . #% Bearing in mind the existence of the ` one per cent club ' of Member States who wish to keep European-level spending within an overall cap of one per cent of GDP , I want to offer some suggestions as to ways in which spending on research might be increased at a European level , without necessarily breaching that one per cent cap , and given that there seems to be no lack of goodwill on the part of Member States to spend more on research . #% For some companies the correct response to the challenges is to look to the high-tech field , but it is not an option available to everyone . #% As regards the framework directive , regulations purporting to give effect to the EU directive 's ban on discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation actually allow an employer to impose a requirement relating to sexual orientation , if the doctrine of the religion or the religious convictions of its followers so dictates . #% Yet this has not happened , because the Soviet-style approach resulted in the re-introduction of the economic model of central control leading to clientelism and interventionism in all aspects of public life . #% We merely regret that this report has appeared before its time and is unacceptable . #% I have given him a text , which was circulated to him yesterday , which makes the position clear : after the plenary vote , the Council and the Commission will take the earliest opportunity to consider Parliament 's views . #% To those of our colleagues who felt that , in these fields , we did not go far enough , I would say that we have a foundation of security which harmonisation at the highest level can now proceed . #% Mr President , I should like to say to the Commissioner that , at a time of violent clashes in Genoa and concern over globalisation , the outcome of the Bonn Summit should have renewed peoples ' faith in the political process . #% We do , however , benefit from maintaining the natural span of spices and preservatives which are used in our stores and which are kept for long periods of time . #% The matter is currently before the French courts , but I am sure that this House will join me in asking the President of this Parliament to write to Eutelsat demanding a full explanation of why it is breaking its own charter committed to upholding media freedom . #% We should not underestimate the length of the journey that we are beginning today by starting on this legislation . #% I have a file full of casework on airlines which are not paying compensation that people are clearly entitled to . #% If Latin America is plunged into deep crisis , this will inevitably have a very serious effect on the American economy and pose the threat of a world crisis more serious than any since the pre-war era , which could devastate Europe . #% The CFSP should remain intergovernmental but subject to reform . #% I , like many others here , will remember the enthusiasm and political excitement with which this convention was adopted , how many world leaders were keen to be seen with young people and to talk in glowing terms of the future they were offering . #% On the most contentious points , namely the question of competence of data harmonization , the concept of an observatory and , most of all , the budgetary implications , the detailed work of the rapporteur and the negotiations undertaken by Mr Collins , as the relevant committee chairman , and others have borne fruit . #% Mr President , recently a terrorist suspect wanted by the British Government was arrested and extradited from Rome in a matter of weeks . #% Mrs Bennasar 's amendments , which were supported by the Committee on Women 's Rights , give more weight to the involvement of NGOs in the execution of the Daphne programme . #% The problems that Mr Cox has identified about the cumbersome and costly VAT recovery procedures , on which I and many Members get many letters , clearly is a major obstacle . #% Ahmadinejad 's words are an outrageous threat but his actions could give Iran the power to make good that threat . #% So I say to those people who voted against the report in committee : if you had got your way , there is no way we would be standing here today . #% It would make peace and reconciliation much more difficult , as no longer could guerrilla leaders or dictators be given any kind of guarantee or immunity from prosecution after a peace and reconciliation process . #% It is also welcome that energy matters have risen to the top of the agenda . #% It is our duty and privilege to help to bring that about . #% We have the guarantee of annual impact assessments . #% It should , of course , be codecision , but it is not . #% That to me seems a backward step . #% 
That is the view of this Parliament . #% It would not hurt too much to accept amendments on those questions as well and to give us a rounded proposal we can all be proud of , that we might even get a second-reading agreement on . #% We must never again turn a blind eye to genocide , we must never again tolerate ethnic cleansing , we must never again appease a brutal dictatorship . #% Finally , as someone who is merely a consumer of olive oil , I hope there is no extensive dilution of what is one of my favourite complementary foodstuffs and that , whatever else we do in the European Community , we strive together with olive oil producers of all sizes to maintain the maximum quality . #% Finally , could you say little more about human rights violations as a whole ? #% It is highly likely that these shortcomings are repeated throughout the canon of EU environmental law . #% During the last of those years I have had correspondence and contact on their behalf , both with our national authorities and with the Commissioner 's bureau . #% MEPs on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy will insist that we are much better informed on this , so that we can keep track of what is happening on behalf of our anxious constituents . #% We have seen successive British governments seemingly deliberately and successfully keeping the British public in the dark about ` project Europe ' . #% My plain-speaking constituents have no time for regionalism and I doubt if they would be interested in strategic spatial impact evaluation procedures . #% Mr President , I will speak generally and not to any specific report . #% There is much rightly to raise with the Government of North Korea regarding human rights in the prisons and camps , plus the humanitarian situation in the countryside , rather than these blanket and unsupported catch-all allegations that do no credit to our work . #% My own view is that the accession of China to the WTO , whilst perhaps not quite as eye-catching as a multilateral agreement , is just as important to the future global trade regime , and that a similarly political position might therefore be taken by both Parliament and the Commission . #% As new working patterns become more common , it is clear that we need to ensure that pension provision is guaranteed for both men and women in those different working environments . #% Therefore , I offer you another chance to answer : will the Council undertake an audit of Member States to establish those states which have discriminatory legislation against lesbians and gay men , which fail to offer equal rights , equal civil rights to lesbians and gay men and which fail to offer equal protection under the law to lesbians and gay men ? #% They do not want to have any fat at all throughout the European Union . #% Mr President , as a number of colleagues have said , this is nothing new . #% I understand that the Conference of Presidents has sent quite a strongly worded letter to the Belgian authorities concerning the prospect of two members of the Zimbabwean delegation being on the visa ban list . #% It calls for the goal to make Europe the most energy-efficient economy in the world by setting targets for annual reduction in energy of the order of 2.5 % to 3 % and for a robust strategy for Montreal . #% Sixthly , is it wise to increase the recycling targets ? #% Nevertheless , we do not accept that for this process to progress further that it needs a fully-fledged EC Constitution with the loss of more powers from Member States to the EU . #% In setting out the guidelines for the 2007 budget - one that is different from others in the sense that it has been the first budget in the new financial perspective - much of the first part of the year was spent in negotiating the result of the financial perspectives . #% It is clear that much more can be done and that more funding would make a huge difference , so what excuse can we possibly have not to provide it ? #% Even now , we have to ask if there is the political will to put in place the measures likely to prevent future suffering on this scale . #% It is interesting how company law in the various Member States has created companies that differ qualitatively from one other . #% Let me start by saying that I am all for food and animal feed safety , but I can not understand why the European Union believes that it is necessary to establish the European Food Safety Authority . #% For the moment , therefore , the Commission , in common with others in the international community , calls on the Russian authorities to use proportionate force both in fighting on the territory of Dagestan and in hot pursuit operations across the Chechen border . #% You will be aware that the Commission adopted a report on the organization of the tobacco market simultaneously with its communication on smoking prevention . #% What we have heard today should have been heard over the last four years . #% Having said that , and I made the point on Monday , our group last night discussed this fully and we feel that all six candidates are competent members of the European Central Bank and we will be voting for all six today . #% I was saddened by what Mr Nassauer has said . #% What you were actually asked , if you will read the question please , is whether the Government supports an EU regime or , as suggested by one of your Government ministers in the House of Lords last year , the 25 national regimes . #% They do not share your view , Commissioner . #% Why such a strategy of non-cooperation is thought to serve the interests of the British people is not clear . #% When wars continue , humanity loses its purpose . #% I am an automotive engineer by background ; I have seen the test laboratories ; I have talked to the engineers about the problems of achieving more pedestrian-friendly cars . #% We must also ensure that young disabled people -- that includes people with MS -- do not end up being cared for alongside elderly people . #% Perhaps we have to start to think about doing less but better . #% A multi-annual plan should also be adopted by the Community . #% Mr President , the tone of the debate in this House is clear : most of us want to assist the Irish presidency to reach a quick settlement on the Constitution through our political contacts , and with our experience of these questions we can provide both practical and moral support . #% Some of the most useful recommendations in the report include the need for an innovation chain which links industry-related research to innovation and application of the technology , and an increased emphasis on resource efficiency and sustainability which ties in with the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy . #% You have proposed in Agenda 2000 that 30 % of Phare funds be spent on improving administrative capacity , including exchanges between national officials . #% We remain engaged . #% It is vital for our prospects of bringing the world ever closer in terms of these minimum core standards - which include an end to slavery and child labour - that we start this round properly . #% It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves . #% The country outrageously styles itself ` the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ' , and yet the people have never been consulted , as Mr Kim inherited his mandate from his late dictator father . #% Yet there are new challenges to health associated with the accelerated globalisation of the markets , such as SARS and avian flu . #% In the context of African Union and our ACP obligations , Commissioner Nielson suggested an extremely welcome and innovative way in which we can support Africa 's own efforts to manage conflict . #% Therefore , UKIP MEPs will not vote on the Rübig report . #% They have cellars and vaults full of pictures for which no display space is available . #% How can we show ourselves to our electorate and how will the EPP be able to show itself to the electorate when it quite rightly makes a fuss about fraud in the election campaign yet , when it comes to delivering here , it fails to deliver ? #% We know or believe that we are all talking about the same thing : primarily , endangered species , in particular the great apes . #% Mr President , in his speech Mr Cashman made various quite serious allegations . #% Having ended its nine-month freeze on uranium enrichment , it is now on a collision path with the United States and the EU , a case likely to end in the United Nations Security Council , where I hope Russia and China will also support tough , non-proliferation measures or sanctions , if need be . #% The coalition we are striving to build across the world to fight against terrorism is trying to find a cure to the problem , but there is also the issue of prevention in terms of security and diplomacy . #% We can not meet our climate change targets if we do not have a workforce with the necessary skills to deliver . #% What you have said is a summary of what has happened up to now but not an indication that there really is going to be dynamic action in the foreseeable future , as it is autumn now . #% I hope that in your response , President-in-Office , you will say that you will help us establish that truth . #% I sympathise because the United Kingdom lost its independence and identity when a referendum on trade turned out to be a political take-over . #% However , this document still fails to address the weaknesses in the way the Commission is operating , as revealed by the Eurostat affair . #% I have worked very closely with the European Trade Union Confederation and with the public service unions both at first reading and second reading and I have received - and a number of Members here will have received - a large number of representations from concerned individuals in those countries . #% We need to look again at the old ideas dating from David Ricardo onwards that comparative advantage always works in everybody 's best interests . #% We have always argued for the removal of trade barriers to promote a more efficient and competitive agricultural sector , to deliver a better deal for the consumer , and to present market access opportunities for less economically developed countries . #% As we put this legislation in place , one of the keys to this whole process is proper enforcement : to ensure that we have the right type of lorries and the proper rest periods . #% The basic reason is , of course , simple : too many boats chasing too few fish . #% We would like to begin a dialogue with the British Presidency and then to follow that with the Austrian Presidency on the role of economic coordination and the accountability of that bank . #% 
The ECB may respond shortly , but almost two years since the euro 's launch , there is as yet little enthusiasm for its future role as the major international reserve currency . #% What can Parliamentarians do ? #% Probably the Socialist Group , the Green Group and the Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group will oppose them . #% author . - Mr President , Azerbaijan is , regrettably , a one-party , semi-authoritarian state where political opposition to the dynastic rule of the Aliyev family is barely tolerated . #% I do not like this system . #% Mr President , Commissioner Bolkestein put the history of this debate in just a few words with his usual aplomb . #% For some reason , over these past twenty years the Council of Ministers or the ministers meeting in political cooperation have been unwilling to put together a document . #% So I very much welcome what the Commission has said about the role of cultural industries , about how we want to preserve and to build on those and how there is an economic role for culture . #% This delay in payment must not be used as an excuse to attack the budget for these important measures or be allowed to discourage those new to European programmes from fully benefiting . #% I was quite alarmed by the implications of this question and , indeed , by the contribution we heard from the other side of the House . #% We have a responsibility all of us , particularly to the developing world , and particularly to countries which were our colonies in the past to whom we have not shown the respect they deserve . #% I can not help thinking however that although these values have gone sky high and we may expect the bubble to burst , nevertheless the underlying structural change in our economies is here to stay . #% Mr President , in his opening remarks Mr van den Berg -- and indeed others -- picked up on the huge amounts of money we are talking about . #% One of the crucial elements of doing the job better is improved development of our legislative strategies and early consultation in the process . #% Concession on night work became a key in securing the inclusion of the self-employed . #% In fact , we need to move not just from TACs but to quotas so that we do not have the classic race-to-fish problem that we have here in our own waters . #% We call for an appropriate sum for cancer equipment in the Republic of Belarus , which is still significantly affected by the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in adjacent Ukraine . #% Secondly , does he not agree that were the current government , at a national level , to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level , then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6 ( 1 ) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action ? #% Some of us in my group , however , would have liked us to express a more generous stance . #% There have been similarly huge , visible changes in terms of prosperity , security , democracy , the rule of law and the fight against corruption in public life . #% Commissioner , where exactly is that money going to come from ? #% I would like very much to see the European Community also establish diplomatic relations with the DPRK . #% It is predicated on landfill at full capacity in ten years , whereas district councils project some thirty . #% Reference has already been made to the concept of super-safe third countries and indeed safe third countries . #% You spoke of companies and businesses . #% This is not an abstract issue to them , nor is it a matter that has long since been resolved . #% I laugh . #% Therefore , while I welcome much of the Haug report , the British Labour Members stand firmly behind the efforts of successive British Prime Ministers , including Tony Blair , in their just demand for budgetary fairness and equity . #% Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for his detailed explanation of the situation which faces us at the second reading , which I do not intend to duplicate tonight . #% However , the fact that the El Salvadorian Government has recently ratified four key ILO conventions is not the real victory it might seem , because by reforming its civil service laws the Government has actually succeeded in removing large numbers of workers from any possible benefits of those ILO conventions . #% I had the honour of representing Cornwall and Plymouth in this House for ten years . #% Mr President , Mr Hughes says he does not want a new agency and yet his resolution plainly calls for a new agency and to deny it is merely playing with words . #% b ) current law requires the airline to make provision , to require travel agents and booking firms do so will place an intolerable administrative burden on them , will seriously confuse the area between the agent 's responsibility and the airline 's , and will raise costs , and is probably against EU law . #% Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ? #% In the last two days , senior black opposition activists visiting this Parliament have insisted that the crisis is nothing to do with land , but about Mugabe 's desire to hold on to power . #% While there is much in the Malmström resolution that we can support , unfortunately there are significant elements that have been included which we find unacceptable . #% I appreciate too that we are running into a new era where import controls will be different and a new sector will be joining our textile industry . #% The President-in-Office of the Ecofin Council referred to our citizens , to the need to create jobs , to the need to deal with social exclusion and poverty . #% The Commission should also publish , before the end of 2004 , proposals for EU-wide economic instruments aimed at reducing atmospheric emissions from ships . #% We are still concerned about insufficient coordination in this particular area . #% In particular , we do not want to see any more public European money used to continue building barriers for people with disabilities . #% Our belief is that the two systems can coexist . #% This directive on cross-border health will also ensure that Member States establish contact points to provide sufficient information to citizens wishing to travel abroad for treatment . #% As we have seen on issues such as the Working Time Directive , people all too often do not realise that they have rights , let alone that they can enforce them . #% In this respect I believe this report is not short enough , is not concentrated enough and although it is worthy in many areas , it has compromised too far and fails to deliver fully in these key areas . #% Therefore Mr Viola will have my full backing just as he will have my backing tomorrow in his very important report on the island regions of Europe . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for a thorough answer although he has not actually answered the last part of my question , namely , do there need to be two ratifications - one for EU membership and one for EEA membership ? #% One of the most frequently-voiced concerns about our research activities at European level is the complexity and burden involved in the administrative procedures and regulations relating to the funds , which make it very difficult for small - and medium-sized enterprises and small research entities to access the funds and take part in the programmes . #% We do not know exactly how it was brought into the United Kingdom . #% The EU must manage the funding it receives in a more transparent and cost-effective manner , targeted towards stimulating economic growth and prosperity across Europe . #% Our rich and diverse cultural heritage is something that the citizens of Europe should be proud of and , indeed , is one of the primary reasons why millions of people from around the world visit Europe every year . #% It is easy perhaps to dismiss it saying that we have not gone all the way down the line but we know that 5 ppm exists at the moment . #% We need to give them respect and make certain that they are treated fairly . #% It would have been easy to vote against the whole report because of these points alone . #% It touches matters of taxation law . #% One of the main reasons we are failing to achieve such a single market is poor implementation and inconsistent interpretation . #% Good European regulation cuts bureaucracy and red tape . #% While it is true that this is a step forward in terms of codification and gives greater clarity to citizens , the approach seems somewhat begrudging : the common position seems to grant a right with one hand , only to add an enormous set of qualifications to that right with the other . #% I am sure that Parliament is most appreciative . #% Embalming is now common , technology has moved on . #% There are simply no real safeguards . #% At the moment we have a situation where they will have a five-year period in which to prepare themselves . #% No one has been more single-minded about the single currency than Mr Lamfalussy . #% And , make no mistake , the fact that shareholders could potentially lose EUR 10 000 , even if not paid in at the start , does add an extra tier of financial expectation . #% That includes such things as caged beds , which should not be a part of any country 's policy . #% If the allegations in the American press are to be believed , then one multimillionaire can call in the chips to get the Clinton administration to put the boot into small countries in the name of free trade . #% 
They were given no translation , no help from the consular services and had to meet the cost of over GBP 3000 for a zinc coffin alone . #% As an aside , I just thought I would mention in passing that , under the Labour Government in the United Kingdom , railway patronage has increased 20 % over recent years - even on the route from London to Birmingham ! #% It is very pleasing to see you here , to provide a detailed answer to the question that I had tabled . #% The Regulation was therefore held to be valid . #% An example is Norway 's loss of free trade in fish with Poland . #% They are accused of a white-collar crime . #% The police and the military singularly failed to protect and defend the government . #% When the rapporteur came to the Transport Committee she stated that at # 40 per seat the cost of smoke hoods would be too high . #% Ultimately , the UK ended up with only 3.5 % of the funds available for the EU-15 . #% I am proud that the European Parliament has helped deliver your demands . #% author . - Mr President , I do not think I will pull my punches here tonight in regard to this particular oral question on the implementation of the first railway package . #% The Burmese military dictatorship is now in its 43rd year of illegitimate rule . #% There is also growing cooperation between the relevant Commission and Russian officials in customs and anti-fraud activities . #% The Commission , however , is not disposed , certainly at this juncture , to contemplate the possibility of sanctions of various kinds , including the ones suggested by the honourable Member , simply because the Commission is making its contribution and its commitment on behalf of the Union in full knowledge of the dire needs of people and organisations in that area . #% We needed to come up with a new solution to provide help . #% This result can not be ignored , either on the basis of a lower-than-normal turnout - what price legitimacy ? - or because some people feel that the only good referendum result is a positive one . #% I urge the Commission to listen and to implement everything in this report . #% The need is there , the manpower is there - we must seize the opportunity and respond to this challenge of a new economy . #% Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved . #% Contrary to criticism , the regulation on public access to documents works quite well . #% Mr President , I have an interest , though not a financial one , in this subject in that I am chairman of the Northern Energy Initiative , a company which operates in the north-east of England , and has within it a renewable energy agency whose objective is to promote the development of renewable energies . #% It would be outrageous to take money from the taxpayer and to use it to influence the voters ' decision . #% I should like to thank you , Madam President , for writing a letter to the Greek authorities about the plane spotters , and for what you said today . #% Despite the protestations of the Commissioner , it is plain that this report is about harmonising taxes : it seek to produce a harmonised regime for vehicle taxation in the European Union . #% We believe that civil liberties are not secondary to security ; we are told that a key value of the European Union is the protection of freedom , justice and civil liberties , and we agree with the last speaker that we need to be vigilant on this . #% It would be much fairer to tell them - as I have done in replying to letters I have received - that we are very sorry but we can not help them . #% I share our strong statement of support and solidarity for human rights organisations and defenders , who risk their lives daily in conflict situations around the world to defend principles , which we hold dear . #% We would ask the Commission to seriously reconsider softening its approach to this regime , which continues to show utter contempt for human rights and democracy . #% They themselves are now taking the French Ski Association to the courts . #% I would like to make it clear that I do not share the criticism over the last year that the ECB has acted too little and too late . #% For too long , companies , especially in my region of the South East of England , have been targeted by this unscrupulous practice . #% Most people believe that things got worse within the Commission in that time rather than better . #% In my constituency of Devon and East Plymouth which contains cities and isolated farming communities there are numerous ICT projects in hand : for distance learning , for academic exchanges of information with the universities in other Member States , for training , for business such as a satellite link ISDN video for cattle auction by remote bidding or for telesales operations . #% This proposal typifies the belief of this assembly that , for every ill in society , the solution is a new law and - when that fails - to create another . #% The conditions and the controls in the abattoirs were such that one drew the conclusion from the report that it is perfectly possible today , 29 March 2000 , that animals with BSE are still entering the food chain in France . #% The third area which needs reform is in the product market . #% Madam President , I too would like to add my thanks to Mr Mulder for the way he has carried out his work as budget rapporteur this year . #% Incidentally , the compromise was the best deal for the Italian pensioners as well . #% Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask , in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing , to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies , particularly in development , because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right . #% Therefore , the ball is now firmly in the Commission and Council 's court . #% If that really is the case , would you not agree that the rules need to be reviewed ? #% The unemployed this year and those who lose their jobs in the last years of the ECSC have a right to support , no less than those we have supported in this budget in the past . #% The Commission says that under the Framework Agreement it is not allowed to reveal the answers because there may be legal proceedings . #% In fact , members of the committee find that the whole European Union approach to genetically modified food at the moment is in a rather confused state . #% Indeed , from Parliament 's perspective , the two outstanding points that he felt needed to be discussed were resolved in the informal trialogue . #% The BSE crisis shone a spotlight on the possible health risks associated with beef . #% We would like the Commission and Council to respond to the questions asking them to give an explanation of the grounds for continuing to have confidence in the current contractor and in its ability to successfully take the systems forward . #% I have been a Member of this Chamber for ten years and we seem to have spent most of those ten years debating events in former Yugoslavia . #% On the internal front , I hope that the proposed European Union common definition of terrorist crime and associated legislation will be sufficiently robust to allow effective action at last to be taken against large numbers of terrorist front organisations throughout Europe . #% I regret that Mr Cashman is seeking to make this so contentious . #% But on top of that the very functioning of the European Union can so easily be brought to a halt by a single government if it choses to do so . #% It is very difficult to see why he would have bothered or needed to falsify some of the 50 signatures needed to have his candidature be legally effective . #% I had the opportunity last week , along with a number of colleagues from various parties and groups here , to meet with Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry who reported to us that violence against the Indo-Fijians is still continuing in Fiji . #% He has been unable or unwilling to reign in terrorist suicide bombers , including his own Fatah al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade . #% My final point is -- and I stress the need to be more radical -- that I think the way forward is to look at the total quotas of fish caught and see if we can not change that into days at sea and fishing effort , so that we can land all the fish caught . #% Thanks to the economic absurdities of this place , as well as of national government , we can not rely on the generational support system any longer . #% The results of the Scientific Steering Committee back on 1 August ruled that British beef was as safe as any other beef and that was led by a French chairman . #% In this report Parliament is fulfilling its traditional role of looking ahead , being a little bit adventurous , but looking to the future : as we did with Spinelli report that preceded the Single Act , the Martin report that preceded Maastricht and the Bourlanges report which preceded Amsterdam . #% Retailers and others in the supply chain are expected to absorb the duties . #% Secondly , Commissioner , the whole matter of decentralisation to the delegations : will you be ensuring that in the delegations you have members of staff with expertise to deal with conflict prevention and peace building ? #% Frankly , we would have preferred a higher threshold in Article 3 , as regards the representativity of European political parties , but we are happy to accept , in the spirit of compromise that is necessary in the European Union , that this somewhat lower threshold will apply . #% I had been the coordinator of the ` yes ' campaign at Oxford University . #% This directive is more concerned with the market system , with choice , and with people 's ability to choose where to go , and to have money follow them . #% Will the reader be robust enough to withstand these conditions ? #% Finally , I very much support the amendments by Mrs Junker and Mr Bowis on the problem of vaginal fistula . #% It is a bulwark against the rise of extremism , in particular regional Islamist tendencies such as those evidenced by recent attacks on Christian and western targets in Pakistan . #% 
Good practices do work and they save lives . #% Johannesburg has to deliver results . #% At some time or other , Parliament must give a clear signal as to its true sense of purpose , its true priorities . #% When it comes to extra red tape British Labour MEPs are way out in front . #% Human rights is important , particularly the situation of women . #% I hope the Commission will be able to tell us , because clarity should always be our watchword in these matters . #% This October ASEAN intends to include Burma at the ASEM V summit in Hanoi . #% However , we disagree with the idea that the European Parliament should take up its time issuing pronouncements on this subject , however worthy or well-intentioned . #% We have to reform our governmental processes . #% We need a new initiative from the Commission on this . #% My conclusion for you , Commissioner , is that we want joined-up policy . #% Loss of savings can be a personal tragedy for the families concerned . #% President , Commissioner , over the years Parliament , the Council and the Commission have all worked to secure a common market for goods and capital , fair trade and free trade for those with money . #% I particularly welcome his strong support for the proposal that , in the interests of improving pollution prevention and avoiding distortions of competition , the environmental requirements should apply to all ships irrespective of the flag they fly and adequate waste reception facilities be made available in all ports throughout the Community . #% Mr President , as you will be aware , last Monday my office received an incendiary bomb which was addressed to me but opened by my staff . #% Another is the buildings reserve , another is the posts which have now been put into reserve and another is the second tranche of EUR 1 500 per Member per month for the assistants ' allowance . #% Fourthly , the working conditions of Commission staff should better reflect the practices of national administrations in the Member States . #% We want to ensure that there will always be the highest management standards , in particular by these agencies cooperating fully with OLAF , by sharing best practice amongst themselves because many of the management challenges are very similar and by ensuring that their boards are an effective instrument to hold management to account and are not just a bureaucratic and cosmetic gesture . #% Yet there are serious challenges before us in the buildings area , and I am sure that , in the approach that Mr Viola is taking , he will continue with the same level of serious scrutiny as we have had in the past . #% Do you not think some of them - not all - are getting too big for their boots . #% For this reason it is vital that the Central Bank enjoys the confidence of the financial markets . #% Leading opposition figures have been arrested and beaten , and a few have disappeared , although -- mysteriously -- some have reappeared . #% Also we must not forget the initiative taken by the Spanish presidency which got the Barcelona Conference off the ground . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , Russia is an important partner for the EU on many fronts , but we can not pretend that Russia is a genuine democracy with a rule of law . #% I know the Commission is looking at that as well . #% We all know that the legislative process is long and winding and perhaps it is something that we may want in future . #% May I also ask him a question about the importance of maintaining peace . #% Twenty years ago it was going to be happening in 50 years time . #% I have to say to my good friend , colleague and namesake Mr Bushill-Matthews that his Amendment No 11 is an amendment too far . #% One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars . #% We agree with them that the complete lack of evaluation of the number of disabled beneficiaries is a marked failure to achieve the mainstreaming , which the Commission so often talks about . #% For many of us , this issue about payment for work done is a question of principle ; it is also that companies and economies have benefited and that this is not supposed to be a legislative measure to punish the irregular migrant . #% So I hope for a positive response . #% However , the question is legitimate whether this uniformity in targets is most effective , both from an environmental and economic point of view . #% Mr President , I share some , if not all , of Mrs McKenna 's reservations on the Pirker report . #% I am rather surprised to see a procedure without debate on a report under the name of Mr Westendorp . #% For my own constituents and for all of Europe 's citizens , I give the green light to this proposal . #% While the EEVC and other test methods should continue to develop with new technologies , currently there are no equivalent tests , so those tests are for the moment standard . #% We have here the views of the Committee on Fisheries on the continuing crisis in the fishing industry . #% But , unfortunately , that is not the view of everybody . #% That is not ambitious enough , certainly not for a first reading , when we have so many negotiations yet to come . #% Commissioner , the purpose behind this oral question today is to give you the opportunity to share some thoughts with us before making your proposal to the Council and Parliament on how research is to be funded . #% But it would delay the adoption of this dossier beyond the Danish Presidency into the spring - the earliest would be March under the Greek Presidency . #% With export subsidies available of up to ECU 400 per head , it is hardly surprising that both honest and unscrupulous traders are hardly rushing to take up alternatives . #% That is just one example of where we have tried to go along with Parliament 's wishes . #% I simply wish to emphasise the support of the European Democrats for strong action to reinvigorate that Agenda . #% Whilst we accept that the House is divided on the legal questions , we appeal for unity in looking forward , not back , working together for peace , reconciliation and reconstruction in a democratic Iraq . #% I do not regard Mr Nielson as someone who is thin-skinned , but I believe that statement did not do him justice . #% The Committee on Fisheries for instance had only one hour whereas other committees had three hours . #% Therefore , all the demands made by this resolution to treat the detainees either as innocent bystanders caught up in American crossfire in Afghanistan or common-law criminals subject to due process are legally not sound , and not necessarily desirable either -- particularly if we are to protect Europe 's security and people from further attacks . #% It is true that business as usual can go on to a degree on the basis of the old Constitution , namely the various treaties that we have , but these treaties are not satisfactory . #% The EU should not continue to turn a blind eye to such abuses . #% Finally , on recital M , there have been some translation problems . #% These measures have , I understand , already been accepted in principle by the key parties involved . #% As several Members may know , that assists the Commission in its efforts to sustain progress with the reform and modernisation that Parliament has called for and to do so in good time , so that if everything else goes well it can to implement at least the first part of the scheme by the end of this year . #% My party 's representatives in this House were elected on a whole host of pledges , the main one being to sort out the accounts of the European Commission and other European institutions and make sure that the reform process that most people in this House are pleased to see going forward is actually driven through and achieves results . #% Application for inclusion in the scheme is therefore voluntary , but the new scheme differs from previous ones , particularly on the following major points . #% The EU-ACP partnership remains a model for North-South cooperation in our world and one which we celebrate properly in our vote for ratification in the European Parliament this week . #% You did not even respond to that . #% I am sure that as time moves on the situation will change . #% Clearly , fishing fleets are too large , clearly fishing effort is too strong - so we have a big problem ! #% I wonder if you really feel there is an opportunity for you and the US to find new common ground in the agriculture talks . #% But the one thing we have given is the acceptance of the financial perspectives enshrined in the Treaty . #% Without this amendment this potentially misleading suggestion could encourage more live imports , with obvious animal welfare implications . #% In 1992 , some 130 officials were working on occupational health and safety within the European Commission . #% The Commission 's role should be to coordinate , not to dictate . #% 
For 1996 they were offered a cut of 30 % in their salaries in exchange for an increase of 240 teaching hours . #% It is indeed a mark of a civilised country that it takes its prison service seriously , and all allegations in the United Kingdom , and I imagine in other countries , against malpractice or cruelty in prisons are properly investigated . #% Commission forecasts show that maybe every year there would have been one mobile worker from the East for every 1000 inhabitants in the West , if it had been shared among all states . #% That is a right that exists in many national parliaments , - not in all of them , national systems differ on this , but it is one that should apply at the European Union level . #% Mr President , this proposal has a long history . #% As is clear , not only from the debate earlier this evening , but also from the discussion in this House and in its committees over the last weeks and months , the whole issue of immunities is arcane , incoherent and muddled . #% The problem is that the second part of the answer should be to say what she is going to do to make sure that it is implemented . #% This Parliament 's procedures leave us in a position of weakness . #% At WTO level , objections have been registered to our EU proposal . #% Then there is the whole issue of competitive tendering . #% The pollution in the water supply in nearby slums is also 500 times above the maximum recommended WHO levels . #% He says : ` they do not pose a significant health risk ... and have been dropping for some time ' . #% In addition , the FDA and JEFCFA - the scientific advisory body of WHO - have approved the substance . #% I beg to differ . #% Some of the news over the last few days is a little mixed , particularly from the United States , over the concessions which were extracted from the Administration in the fast-track debate and the debate on trade and steel in Washington . #% Mr President , it is clear that the larger eurozone governments have no intention of tying their hands by promising to adhere to the 3 % deficit limit . #% We already suffer from examples of this elsewhere . #% However , excessively restrictive application of regulations may threaten the future of some producers and specialist suppliers such as health food shops , possibly encouraging consumers to buy from unregulated internet suppliers . #% We must stimulate the widest possible debate . #% Furthermore , they are not capable of being detonated by the foot of an innocent child , as is the case with antipersonnel mines . #% Yet this debate has dragged on year after year with it becoming increasingly difficult for the public 's wish to be turned into practice . #% In one example given to us , workers in the tobacco industry could lose hundreds of pounds a week in overtime pay if they were limited to working 48 hours . ' #% He stated that , according to its conclusions , there have been abuses on a massive scale . #% Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control . #% What shall we answer ? #% Unlike other former Soviet countries , the outcome is still genuinely uncertain and contrasts markedly with the election two weeks ago in Belarus , where a massive fraud was perpetrated on the people of that country . #% What we should not tolerate is intolerance itself . #% When it comes to security we should make it clear that the extension of NATO to all potential future members of the EU is not desirable or feasible . #% They are from all socio-economic groups . #% The one problem , I suppose , with the results of the survey was that they were reported after we had decided on the Socrates II programme and the Erasmus parts of it . #% in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues can agree with much of this report . #% Mr President , we need to change this amendment so that it better reflects the realities of the Treaty of Nice . #% But Mr Fantuzzi 's amended text is better and I ask you to support it . #% But the telling part of this report is the reference to the Tampere European Council which intends to force a European system of justice on the UK and the comment that ` there is a long way to go until justice is procedurally , evidentially and substantially administered in a more or less similar way in all the Member States ' . #% As Mr Verheugen said , there is no more that the Turkish Government could have done . #% Another round of denunciation by MEPs serves no useful purpose . #% I would now just like to talk briefly about the report by Barnard , Deakin and Hobbs , which the rapporteur referred to . #% Two years ago three journalists were sentenced to three years of hard labour for slandering the President . #% Mr President , my group will support Mrs Malmström 's proposals , and I would also like to offer her our congratulations for the hard work she has put in for more than nine months and in negotiating intensely with the Commission . #% Only if the ECB is open about the way it reaches its decisions will it be able to retain support in bad times as well as in good . #% Sometimes I wonder whether most of ministers ' time is spent trying to design their press releases to say that they have all won for their own industries . #% We ask the Commissioner for Employment to identify a clear timetable for binding disability access standards to the built environment to be established , and , equally , to ensure seamless access by disabled persons to all modes of public transport . #% You have not been elected . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Duisenberg on a successful year in running euro monetary policy . #% Since that debate six months ago , the Commission has proposed further reinforcement of the EU 's human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government , in the light of the EU 's experience with dialogues in other countries . #% By definition such groups are not party to the Ottawa Convention to ban landmines . #% Therefore , it is up to us to find a political agreement and a form of words which will do until 2004 when we can review this whole issue . #% It was very difficult to imagine that French men and women would not pick up tickets and sell them in that way and clearly that was happening . #% Along with everyone else , we must do it : if we have signed up to legislation , we must accept the responsibilities of fulfilling the obligations it gives us , and that is something which I think the UK will do and all the Member States must do . #% Those of us who have been here for a long time have seen many changes , not least in the relationship between Parliament and Council . #% These processes will increase transparency , improve accountability and give citizens rights to access documents . #% But where are the words ` freedom ' , ` choice ' and ` the individual ' ? #% The options proposed by the Commission on own resources are worthy of long and further discussions . #% I represent Hindus , Muslims , Jews , Sikhs , Buddhists , Taoists , all religions , and I am not prepared to say to them : ` The European Union is not for you ' . #% It was once on the scrap heap of the Industrial Revolution and it is now poised to take advantage of the information age we are so speedily , but ambiguously , chasing . #% Could I also urge Commissioner Byrne to introduce a compensation scheme for British beef farmers who are being hit by the illegal action of the French Government ? #% I understand the need to use the ` precautionary principle ' to protect consumers from the possible long-term dangers of the phthalate family of chemicals including DEHP , but I represent a factory in Quedgeley , in Gloucestersire , Gambro , which has received the Queen 's Award to Industry and has 120 employees . #% I visited hospitals where they were trying to treat the casualties of the problem . #% I spent some time working on a lot of these reports . #% Finally , I am particularly glad that we have reached some agreement on the issue of sanctions . #% Any arrangement by which aviation was ultimately incorporated into a wider ETS would also need a cap on the number of emission rights the aviation sector could buy from the market to ensure that aviation itself begins to make some of these cuts . #% First , a committee of wise men was set up on the regulation of European securities markets . #% They can not merely be the pre-trial steps before a disappointed consumer takes refuge in his own legal system for , if they become that , myriads of SMEs will boycott the Net for business , thereby reducing their own profitability and their contribution to society and the national exchequers . #% These proposals threaten to destabilise our relations with Russia , encourage them to modernise and update their own missiles and nuclear weapons , while at the same time driving them to rather than deterring them from producing an Islamic bomb . #% He has sorted out the taxation system , which makes the very valid point that reducing rates of tax very often results in an increase in revenue . #% Improvements in air traffic management could reduce average fuel burn by between 8 % and 18 % , with resultant decreases in all engine emissions . #% 
Relating to Amendment No 11 #% The Indian State actually practices positive discrimination in favour of the lower castes . #% Not radically tackling the language issue now will only get worse after enlargement when there are 40 million Polish speakers who also want their language to be given the same priority as , say , Italian or Spanish . #% We have heard a lot of talk about Article 4 , with people saying that we do not need it , that nutritional profiling can not be done . #% The Labour Party has a long track record of supporting the development of information technology . #% This brings me to the particular aspect . #% It may seem a very small success , but its implications for the good name of European democracy are huge . #% I just want to mention to you , Madam President , that I will be writing to you asking for an interpretation from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities of this matter . #% Although anti-dumping is indeed different from the example of the multi-fibre arrangement , I believe it is no coincidence that this crisis follows the end of quotas . #% There is a specific reference also in the preamble to the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities and there is a reference to the fact that the relevant article is without prejudice to the confidentiality requirements that may be laid down for Members of the European Parliament . #% The proposal would also have disadvantages which I do not have time to go into . #% I should like to follow up on what you said about the contentious products included in these negotiations and ask whether the presidency would consider separate protocols for these products in order to ensure some progress in the negotiations , particularly in relation to wines and spirits and , of course , the prospect of a fisheries agreement ? #% One area where we need to be more proactive is the use of cluster bombs . #% We need to look at this further , to ensure that young people have controlled access and that the videos themselves are not gratuitously violent . #% It is really unacceptable that almost eight years after adoption there are still some Member States trying to work out how they are going to enforce this directive . #% But as a Parliament , we face the dilemma that the Council may put in these figures to make sure that we vote for the accession treaties . #% The Lisbon Summit of 1997 threw down the gauntlet of the risk capital action plan for Europe to pick up . #% I would just say to the Council - and I hope there is somebody from the Council listening to this - I know we can have confidence in the Commissioner , but let us say to the Council that their fine words at Lisbon were great but they should now deliver on them . #% It certainly needs to monitor how MHP is developing and to see whether that needs further encouragement . #% Democracies also have a problem here because our educational establishments rely predominantly on the state for their funding and he who pays the piper seeks to call the tune . #% But when we talk about reform , let us not forget the conditions in which backbench MEPs work in this House . #% There is no consensus on how to deal with Iran , which is in clear breach of the NPT Treaty and its agreements with Britain , France and Germany , but I welcome the 3 February vote by the IAEA to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council . #% They are aware , as we are , of the importance of addressing supply-side constraints , the need for adjustments and the need to meet the associated costs for developing countries . #% Europe provides a convenient fiction for us to continue a dialogue with the Chinese , free from the colonial past and the colonial resentment . #% It is hardly an advertisement for responsible financial governance . #% Our own governments send out confusing signals when they are seen to deal and compromise with terrorists and even sacrifice the reputation of our security forces and individual officers in order to ingratiate themselves with organisations such as the Provisional IRA in the United Kingdom . #% So , without interfering in Member States ' land law -- which is their own affair -- can we please look for some sort of advice , guidance and information for our fellow citizens who buy property in another Member State ? #% I seek clarification . #% Both of these will be helped by Mr Lamfalussy 's proposals , which are sensible and pragmatic . #% Ever closer partnership with the Russian Federation will be essential to achieve these aims . #% Mr President , six years after these proposals were last debated and overwhelmingly endorsed in this Chamber , today we have both new and old voices arguing again over principles and even more over technical issues . #% You yourself seem to be almost supporting it . #% The Commission seems to baulk at giving the Turkish Government that encouragement . #% But today I arrived in Parliament , I opened my window in the office in the Tower and I could not hear Strasbourg airport , I could not even hear the railway . #% I extend an invitation to President Prodi , if he really wants to understand what the citizens of Europe are finding difficult with the European institutions , European rules and regulations , to give up one afternoon and come along to the Petitions Committee to listen to what citizens are saying . #% We believed that we could encourage Turkey on a new path to develop the pluralism and the democracy which that country , of an Islamic tradition but of a secular , political context , seemed to be moving towards . #% Mr President , my group takes a rather different view from that of the last speaker . #% So it has been a pleasure while this directive was passing through Parliament to be lobbied by one company - Honda , to which Mr Goodwill referred - which believes that the standards being proposed by the Commission do not go far enough . #% Yet those workers are then treated as if they are some sort of disposable commodity and as if the work is unskilled , whereas care work is immensely skilled and stressful . #% I had hoped the European Parliament would do its job to bridge differences between our countries at this time of international crisis , and like every rational member in this Chamber I believe everything possible must be done to avoid war whenever possible . #% We in Parliament have taken a pragmatic approach . #% He has also been criticised by politicians and his supervisory board , and I do not believe he has the confidence of this Parliament , the press or the public . #% Through over-legislation , we are risking the demise of small businesses , thus , in turn , limiting the very choices we are fighting to give women and , consequently , the equality they deserve . #% This lack of regard by the Commission for the wishes of Parliament does not bode well for the future of the second committee of inquiry . #% There are adequate powers to detain and deport if security is threatened . #% We are faced with a classic scenario of the Council of Ministers fiddling like some modern-day Nero while the aviation industry of the European Union burns . #% They sit there , completely unelected , and decide what is going to be published and what is not . #% Could you give me guidance , Mr President ... #% At no time has any group , or any individual , been prevented from putting down amendments to put their influence into the procedure . #% Not only that , but it is also utterly counter-productive . #% I owe a great debt to my colleagues of all parties in the committee . #% That is why I would like you , for the same reasons , to support Amendment No 10 tabled in my name . #% Extra products should enhance pension security , not undermine it . #% I would like to think it could happen but , as you say , it has proved impossible so far and I do not see any great hope for the immediate future . #% Mr. President , I would also like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done on this report . #% There is clearly a need for EU-wide random checks , and the UK - my own Member State - has already been applying such a system with very positive results . #% The local authorities in Spain should do far more to take on such tricksters and prosecute those involved in fraudulent behaviour . #% We hope progress will be made on enlargement . #% If the Commission carries out an impact assessment as part of its better regulation proposals , will the Council , when it amends the Commission 's proposals , carry out a further impact assessment of its own amendments ? #% However , it is important to point out that there are large areas of difference between us . #% Let there be no confusion on this matter . #% This was indeed a tragedy of enormous proportions , with significant and perhaps enduring consequences , but the amount of deliberate spills from oil tankers along all our coasts dwarfs the amount of oil that was spilled from Erika . #% As co-author I urge the House and the Council to support this motion . #% British farmers are fed up . #% You will recall that in the April plenary we passed a resolution in this House inviting Mr Rugova to address the Foreign Affairs Committee . #% He puts it plainly when he says that when these companies who are in debt to him pay their salaries they are doing so with his money . #% 
In my own country , lack of investment in roads means that one alternative could be the development of more coastal shipping , using ports , for example Scarborough and Whitby , in my region . #% The Commission will therefore do its utmost to ensure that they continue to provide that facility at the dispersed centres throughout the Union , which obviously is one of the features that gives them their greatest value . #% It is always nice to be right in retrospect , but I would agree with Mrs Dührkop that when funding a budget , we should clearly set the priorities that we wish to set as between the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament , so that we do not find other objectives submerged within a broader political will . #% The first health advice doctors give to their patients coming in with breathing or heart problems is to stop smoking . #% Then they will either succeed in claiming higher prices from the retailers or they will cease production . #% Most of today 's resolution is surprisingly uncontroversial and the extreme amendments placed by the Left were defeated . #% I would like to bring to your attention Council Directive 98/58/EC -- the general farm animal welfare directive -- which states that ` no animal shall be provided with food or liquid in a manner ( ... ) which may cause unnecessary suffering or injury ' . #% We should remember - and the Commission proposal and Parliament 's response highlight the fact - that third-generation mobile telephones , on which so much of our future depends , are an area where clearly the European Union has an important lead , and that this lead is partly , though not wholly , explained by intervention . #% Let the people speak . #% I also welcome the recognition that social cohesion is a necessary part of sustainable development : the poorest people often live and work in the worst environmental circumstances , whether in the EU or Africa . #% We needed to think outside the box . #% in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues are supportive of a number of the suggestions in this report , including training of teachers and pupils learning the languages of the host country . #% We should wait until these tests are available and then , if we must , impose migration limits . #% His proposals for tackling the problem of large by-catches in sprat fisheries by rigorous controls of landings and closure of fisheries when the by-catch limit is reached are also positive ways forward to ensure the survival and revival of herring stocks . #% I found dozens of basic food hygiene failings . #% I personally am reassured - and I think my group will be - that the Commission will intensify its monitoring of respect for the agreement conditions and have a mechanism for flagging up problems through close cooperation with our partners . #% Mr President , I should like to urge the Commission , in particular the Transport section , to bring forward a report on the transport of nuclear material . #% The common position will mean that the programme remains market-driven , thus providing an excellent opportunity to show that the European Union is prepared to help not hinder business , as is often the case . #% That is what we have just been discussing in connection with enforcement because the problem is that , however much we legislate at European level , if we can not have consistent enforcement , the cost of the legislation falls on people who already have the systems in place and are doing the job . #% I say to the Commissioner that we will be watching very carefully the role of the Commission and the role of organizations such as the Monetary Committee which has no transparency , no democratic legitimacy . #% Like her I welcome the Commission 's continuing focus on action against and treatment of HIV/AIDS , TB and malaria . #% Whether it be this issue or the environment or the application of the precautionary principle , we must have the democratic freedom to be able to insist on some minimum standards acceptable to the majority of our citizens . #% Despite my concern about the environment , I am an optimist and along with the author of the report I believe that much can be achieved in the environment in the process of enlargement . #% Therefore we would like to see an interinstitutional approach which applies impact assessments at all points of the legislative cycle . #% The UK Independence Party will re-establish Britain 's border controls and take back the right to say who shall enter our country . #% I would particularly like to say that it is my first visit here and it is disgraceful that something so undemocratic can take place : somebody has misquoted from the press with no prior engagement with me and no prior notice . #% We have to accept that over 90 % of Europe 's economy relies on the European market providing for powerful transmission mechanisms and spillover effects between Member States . #% It was neither effective nor economic . #% On aid , it appears that the good principles for civil society participation have not yet been realised during the first programming exercise under Cotonou . #% Mr President , I would also like to welcome my constituent , Louise McVay , from Loughborough in the East Midlands , who is in the gallery . #% We have seen how China , even while under the yoke of a dictatorial communist regime , can nevertheless achieve staggering economic development when it embraces capitalist , free-market practices . #% Mr President , before I move on to the Stability and Growth Pact , I would like to make a comment or two about the financial situation in general . #% This Parliament continues to give its overwhelming endorsement to deals that involve huge sums of taxpayers ' money going straight to corrupt African regimes : up to EUR 1.4 billion in the last few years alone , and little or none of it going to the local communities that need it . #% Why should a Swedish gay registered partnership lose all recognition of status when they move , for instance , to Italy ? #% Is the average European citizen in need of extra information about the European Union ? #% Much work has been done already on withholding taxes , and this report adds to the current interest in raising transparency of savings and transactions in such tax havens . #% Finally , a real commitment in the Treaty to include sentient beings would be best of all and I suspect that in the long run the public will eventually demand nothing less than that . #% Why change the rules of the game ? #% While we welcome long-overdue moves to end the EU 's EUR 1 billion-a-year tobacco regime , we feel that the reforms agreed in 2004 do not go far enough soon enough . #% Although there is only a pre-accession agreement with Turkey , he can be assured that the European Parliament is fully aware of Turkey 's candidate or non-candidate status and that this has some legal impact . #% It has been a privilege for me to have been able to work for the first time in my parliamentary career here on a major codecision text like this . #% Although , clearly , the Council proposal can hold in the short-term - which , in a sense , removes some of the pressure both on this Parliament and the Commission - nevertheless the problem will exacerbate rather than diminish . #% But we all know that Galileo is really about extending the power and dominion of the European Union and it is eventually intended to be used for military purposes by the planned EU armed forces . #% We know that malaria is giving real opportunity with the new drugs made from the plant , and we need to accelerate the production and distribution of that as well as of insecticide-protected nets . #% I shall be referring to amendments which have somewhat blurred matters by trying to bring other debates into what should be a clear statement of priorities . #% I was in Jakarta in August , as a special representative of the UNDP working with the Indonesian Parliament , the DPRK , on new rules for that parliament . #% It is not just a German domestic problem : it is an Austrian problem , a Belgian , Dutch , French , Luxembourgish , Italian , Swedish and British problem . #% Regrettably , Russia , under Mr Putin , supplies gas to Belarus at USD 50 per thousand cubic metres and the Belarus economy is rosy enough for Mr Lukashenko to be able to buy the votes of pensioners , the military , the police and all the apparatus of the state . #% I ask you to conduct a serious and immediate investigation into what happened . #% Mr President , my apologies for going too quickly . #% This will be very helpful , but Parliament can certainly help in sharpening up its own act in terms of getting the timetable much sprucer next time around . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , would you allow me to make a point first , before you start the clock . #% Expectations are raised too high . #% They are excellent and I congratulate both the rapporteurs on the hard work that they have done on them . #% Thirdly , has the Commission undertaken any negotiations with any other associated countries with a view to their accession to the Common Transit Convention and will these countries be required to wait longer than the Visegrad states before acceding to the common transit system ? #% We must take the argument directly to the man who has created the problems . #% I am delighted to hear that in his Group , the British Conservatives are in favour of the Constitution , because that is not what some of them said in a debate of the House of Commons yesterday , nor what Jonathan Evans said in a debate with me on BBC television last Friday . #% Having said that , we recognise the different situations in each Member State . #% This is something that we need to take seriously because we really can have an impact . #% Why have these murders happened ? #% This year EU representatives must show that we have the political will to go further to promote the proposal already endorsed by the Council and Parliament for a legally binding international arms trade treaty , and to ensure , both at the review conference this July and at the UN First Committee in October , a resolution to set up a working group to begin to make it happen . #% Better quality and more accurate first decisions would save money through fewer costly appeals . #% rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . - Mr President , as this Parliament 's rapporteur on corporate social responsibility for over three parliamentary terms now , I strongly welcome my colleague , Harlem Désir 's initiative on trade and CSR . #% The report has good things to say on the need for more co-operation internationally by the 27 EU Member States in areas such as transatlantic relations , Georgia , the Eastern Partnership and the broader Middle East . #% The aims of providing proper and accurate information , of encouraging health promotion and education initiatives , of using excise systems to help health measures and of removing temptation in the form of vending machines which are too accessible are not just worthy wishes but practical , effective , proven steps forward . #% If you are going to accept that the staff committee had no part in it , then I think they have to explain why they put posters around the building . #% 
We need cooperation , not conflict , to resolve this particular problem . #% It is in the interests of our citizens that the 2020 programme succeeds in stimulating the creation of good jobs and rising living standards , and it is in the interests of the free world that the 2020 programme points the way to a stronger economic future for all our citizens . #% There is a rumour going round that a recent edition of the Official Journal , published in the Finnish language , has had to be scrapped and is about to be reprinted . #% Interestingly , Iraq and North Korea are the only two cases in the world of non-compliance with NPT safeguard agreements and I would not wish to see Iraq in the position that North Korea is in now , possessing nuclear weapons and immune from assault . #% This is a great help to me because I am doing a course at the Goethe Institute , but other people may find it a little difficult . #% Their owners feel very bitter that the very low prices they are currently receiving for their pigs are not reflected in the prices of meat in the supermarkets which import meat raised to lower welfare standards . #% As a result , over the last two years , previously secret papers on the negotiations leading up to Britain 's entry to the then Common Market have been released and we have been able to see documents relating to the establishment of the common fisheries policy . #% I suspect that we will end up not a million miles from the excellent formula that Mr Nisticò incorporated in his blood and blood products directive . #% This is a very difficult issue because it brings into conflict concern for animal welfare and the need to respect the religious views of ethnic minorities . #% They are talking about other issues . #% For those who are concerned about the money - if I may make a party political and national political point here - if certain of our Member States stopped creating asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan , I am sure we could save a lot more money and indeed save people a lot more misery . #% The EU will now have a GDP of over USD 10 trillion . #% Mr President , the phrase ` Television without frontiers ' seems innocuous and perhaps it is relevant to the television programme , . #% Under my proposal , our President , the President of Parliament , should judge this . #% I am told that there are particular problems in relation to France and Austria . #% To the outside world it appears to be a Commission office and people in the village refer to it as a Commission office . #% Although , as I understand it , they did not breach the disclosure requirements , because the levels of contamination were not that great - and I welcome the Commissioner making that point - nevertheless it would have been better if all information had been made public because more information , not less , is better for restoring and establishing public confidence in the nuclear industry . #% They told me that , on their estimates , 70 % of their research and development costs are absorbed by complying with regulation . #% There has already been a protest in Brussels and there will , no doubt , be many more . #% This is something to be followed . #% The rapporteur - to whom I offer my heartfelt thanks - has forged a compromise which seeks to share responsibility for access between bus manufacturers , operators , local planning and transport authorities . #% Until the Court of Auditors feels able to give that positive statement of assurance , I and my party will continue to vote against discharge of the budget . #% I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that future decommissioning is done in such a way as to ensure that not just the vessel owners , but also those who worked and risked their lives at sea , receive some sort of appropriate compensation for the loss of their livelihood . #% We were given notice that the Minister would be replying to all ten questions at once . #% Probably not . #% They will select the pacts and they will inform the Commission . #% That , unfortunately , is not the case . #% Reforms in beef production introduced in Britain following the beef crisis now make British beef among the highest quality and safest in the world . #% I would like to say to Mr Chichester that in Britain Caesar 's wife has been putting it about a little bit ! #% I should explain that I had written to the General Secretary of the Labour Party informing him that under Rule 2 we could not be given a mandate , and that under Rule 3 , as part of the protocols governing Members of the European Parliament in the treaties , it was clear that we shall not be subject to any form of inquiry - amongst other things by external bodies . #% These are important issues and if it does not , then I think serious questions must be raised . #% Mr Blair started out with a sweeping agenda for reform of the common agricultural policy and cutting-back on overregulation . #% The rapporteur has dealt with this by allowing for such collective responsibility agreements to continue for 10 years after the entry into force of the directive . #% He set out a number of guidelines and stages to be gone through but did not actually give any timescale . #% If that is the devastating country-of-origin principle , then what have we been arguing about all this time ? #% Democracy , the rule of law , human rights and respect for the protection of minorities : these are the values we need to impart . #% It was under those terms that I was asking to express my opinions in my speech . #% This concerns Amendments Nos 4 , 5 , 6 , 18 , 21 , 33 , 36 , 40 , 42 and 46 , some of which directly imply policy down to individual schools in Member States . #% Mr President , it is obviously quite fashionable for Labour politicians to apologize to the public for mistakes that they have made . #% It was a British Conservative Minister for Foreign Affairs , Malcolm Rifkind , who went to Warsaw and became the first western politician to meet with representatives of Solidarity , an act that infuriated the Communist regime . #% This may be absolutely right given its expertise , but we want to ensure that these particular projects are given the priority they deserve . #% In recent years it sometimes seemed that EU countries were competing to become the least attractive to potential asylum seekers . #% Madam President , we need to be serious in this Parliament about achieving genuine reform of the common agricultural policy for the 21st century . #% We refer to this in paragraph 4 of our resolution , the fourth indent , where we specifically state that the current approach is based on wishful thinking . #% Finally , there is the role of Europol . #% So EU measures need both to be consistent with the ECHR and not conflict with or undermine it and , at the same time , to add value in the sense of strengthening practical implementation . #% I would say to the Commissioner that if we do not do something to help the production work during the expiry of the patents , what we will have is the expiry of the patients who might otherwise benefit from having these cheaper drugs so produced . #% That would be positive and could be the route to lasting success . #% . Labour MEPs want to see further improvements in the quality of bathing water and welcomes the opportunity to update the bathing water directive almost 30 years after the existing directive came into force . #% The EU has real authority in the ICO and we have a responsibility in the round-table meeting to hammer out policies which will give the farmers an opportunity to live their lives with dignity and financial security . #% In amending this regulation , we are constrained by a strict legal base within the Treaties and by numerous Court of Justice rulings about the scope of the regulation : definitions of social security and not social welfare in general , for example . #% This definitive measure will provide a useful service to Europe 's consumers in facilitating a safe and competitive pan-European insurance market with mutually recognised and acceptable standards of professional competence by using the financial passport , with only minimal standards being set , rather than prescriptive harmonisation proceedings , as some would have claimed necessary for such an undertaking . #% The resolution is a serious one : it is true that Parliament has previously supported Taiwanese observer status at the WHA -- not the WHO . #% As the European Parliament must always do , it rejects violence on all sides , as the only way of supporting the Road Map for peace in the Middle East . #% This does not exactly conform with the images of helping the struggling artist . #% The next elections in Egypt will be the parliamentary elections and I hope that this House will agree that we should send a mission to Egypt for those elections , whether or not we are invited . #% We now need that large majority . #% I hope that the Commission will agree to draw up proposals for regulations concerning cost reconversion of such coins and notes . #% You need to be tough and to use every resource the Commission has at its disposal to emphasise that national governments have to act on the fine speeches they make in Council . #% Of course , any action along those lines must be based on cooperation with the trade unions and the social partners . #% I believe the Commission has been wrong not to challenge the WTO more strongly on the grounds of the ethicality of the environmental , welfare and social issues . #% Are a number of Member States still not in contact with the Commission on the designation of sites , or is the network now complete ? #% Madam President , I wish to begin by expressing my pleasure at speaking for the first time in this Chamber as a Member of the expanded Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe . #% I would urge the UK to allow legitimate consumer organizations , and not just the DirectorGeneral of Fair Trading , to take such actions . #% It was a time when Ethiopia was the centre of world attention for a variety of reasons . #% Those prerequisites are , admittedly , deregulation and lower taxes , but they are also healthier people living in a healthier environment . #% 
The alternative , if you are going to choose not what is right but what is popular , is to pursue a process of confrontation between two Member States which threatens this whole institution . #% The Commissioner will , I think , be saying in his reply today when the necessary standards are going to be introduced and published . #% Mr Tannock was very clear in his remarks that he did not regard Turkey as a victim of the terrorist attacks and that the victims were ` British and Jewish ' - not Turks . #% However , it is precisely in these areas where the Member States , rather than the EU as a whole , can act , and where they know how best to respond to the educational challenges they face . #% Mr President , I welcome this long overdue report . #% Mr President , I too add my thanks and congratulations to Mrs Guinebertière , although I speak from a slightly different perspective than other Members who have spoken . #% In conclusion we must never lose sight of the fact that globalisation is very much about human issues , it is about standards of living , the environment , cultural , moral and ethical issues . #% As someone who was responsible for the budget on behalf of the Committee on Environment for the first time , I found him very helpful and very considerate of the points I made - not agreeing with everything but nevertheless being very fair-minded . #% I would draw attention particularly to Amendment No 41 which seeks to exclude farmers from Community aid schemes if the regulation is not strictly adhered to . #% We agree that there is a need for more cooperation between national supervisors and enhanced links and dialogue with the US . #% That is a message that must be conveyed to the Council loudly and strongly . #% We should do away with that completely and help , through structural funds , those countries where there is a real economic problem and help them to develop alternative crops . #% You will be aware - because I noticed a distinctly presidential frown - that a Member ' s mobile phone went off during the speech of , I think it was , the Prime Minister of Finland . #% Commissioner , will you support that Amendment ? #% I welcome the suspension of ratification , because there are many things that are needed in terms of transparency , accountability , democracy and inclusion of national parliaments . #% For argument 's sake , let us say his wife would be helping him in the evenings with the paperwork and answering the phone from home . #% Further financial and targeted sanctions must be vigorously imposed . #% As for the Council , there is nothing to suggest that Member States will raise problems with this approach , particularly since it gives full recognition to the competence of Member States to regulate of marital law . #% I believe that in 2007 Wales will become a Fair Trade nation and our Fair Trade support will , as others have said , make an enormous difference to the lives of countless poor people and will mean that we will make our contribution to making poverty history . #% The committee is pleased , however , that in the European Year of People with Disabilities there appears to be progress on the cross-border export of certain disability benefits . #% More regulation is the problem , not the solution . #% Mr President , I asked the Commissioner whether or not there had been consultation with the shipbuilders in the other Member States which will be affected by this . #% Firstly , on the research and development policy of the European Union , Mr Prodi talked about the need to develop and invest in clean technologies . #% This can be achieved by cutting red tape and establishing a simple and coherent system that focuses on societal challenges . #% Which will take precedence ? #% It was a good example of how the common foreign and security policy works in bringing Member States together and it preserved the integrity of the International Criminal Court . #% There do not seem to be any further problems concerning the specific point raised in the question . #% Mr President , for those of us who have sat through the discussions in this conciliation , Mr Ebner 's comments have come as a welcome and positive contribution to our deliberations . #% Internationally negotiated commitments to tackle issues of food security problems are not , in my view , properly understood . #% Europe needs a debate and European leaders need to hear and understand what people are saying to them , especially following the meeting of Foreign Ministers at the weekend . #% I do not know whether she was speaking for her party , for the Parliament or in a personal capacity but I absolutely reject , repudiate and condemn her remarks and am delighted to have this opportunity of publicly dissociating myself from them . #% The report makes only one mention of NATO , seemingly as an afterthought . #% Thank you President . #% I congratulate the pair of them but in this Haug report we make certain assumptions about the revision , about redeployment in Category 4 and about the needs of Kosovo . #% Surely this is a matter of concern for you , President-in-Office ? #% Taking that into account together with the possible situation over the next couple of years , I am reasonably satisfied at this time that this expenditure can be applied for the purpose for which it was intended and in support of the very point of view that the honourable Member put forward . #% So obviously that is a weapon we are prepared to use . #% I was disappointed in President Prodi 's White Paper . #% Yemen , however , has agreed to many human rights treaties and has adapted many of their provisions to its own laws . #% I therefore voted in favour of the recommendations concerning the measures and initiatives to be taken following the financial , economic and social crisis as present in the Berès report . #% Mr President , I agree with most of what has been said . #% Presumably , they are meant to work through the Israeli public , feeling the painful bite of loss of exports and jobs , pressurising the Sharon Government to stop its crazy policies . #% It goes without saying that , the more we educate our young people across Europe , the more the future begins to look brighter in a challenging global environment . #% For the benefit of colleagues I should perhaps explain that a quango is a recently-coined English word short for `` quasi non-governmental organisation '' , in other words , a new piece of bureaucracy , more money spent , more jobs for the boys , more patronage for their bosses . #% This is an area where we want SMEs to compete . #% The second aspect , which was a new element of the directive added between first and second reading , was the provision to apply a new scheme of type approvals for after-market parts , which affected the environmental and safety systems of vehicles . #% We are making progress here . #% In almost every case in the Committee on the Environment , we deal with issues which should rightly be dealt with at European Union level , because they concern matters which affect more than one Member State - transboundary issues . #% The resolution contains some elements that are indisputable , but it is very skewed and contains the usual ingredients of anti-Americanism , excessive concern with the rights of terrorists and extremists and those that support them , and further support for the federalist ambitions of the European Union . #% We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers , intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and , of course , extending into crucial new areas like financial services . #% It is now essential that the Commission starts to act with more financial probity , in order to retain what remains of its credibility . #% The words in the English text that we want to vote on separately are `` and socially balanced '' : those are the separate words . #% We must move away from the idea of banning this or that . #% Mr President , the atmosphere has changed significantly since the visit of George W. Bush to Brussels a few months ago , but it is interesting that in the international press this is not yet recognised . #% The various amendments on mince add to surveillance and traceability in the way we propose . #% The Andersson report really underlines the need for both the employment strategy and the Lisbon strategy to begin to deliver in several important respects : continuing gross gender inequality in terms of access to and participation in the labour market is reflected in gross gender inequality in pension entitlement . #% The coalition aircraft are legally authorised to respond to these attacks in self-defence , and they have done so entirely in accordance with international law , attacking only those units which are threatening them . #% It is a matter of getting the balance right between what is practical and what we can do , as well as making sure that the safety levels we have are as high as possible . #% We need to know what you are doing about it . #% However , it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on . #% It must also stop countries being able to lower their standards , which will be good for asylum seekers , who can be more confident of a fair hearing . #% There is a risk that such lists might place the Members elected through them further away from citizens than those who are elected in the regions , as most of us are . #% All older people should have the right to have access to health care , whatever their age . #% This has certainly improved compared with previous years but that was not difficult . #% The Rules of Procedure rightly make clear that it is not up to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to come to a view on the first question . #% I beg to disagree . #% 
I am extremely pleased to hear the Prime Minister announcing that annulment is now to be annulled . #% The European Parliament must , therefore , demand that all deliveries of arms and military equipment are permanently stopped and that maximum efforts are made to force the Indonesian Government to end its policy of crushing all dissent by force . #% Mr Virgin 's report asks the Commission to respect the wishes of countries who reply to the Commission saying they would not accept wastes , or only certain types of wastes . #% Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 5 , approved by the Committee on Fisheries , reject the changes on the capacity rules altogether . #% We hope that the President of Parliament will convey that information and our view on the matter to the Laeken Summit in two days ' time . #% Why does the Commission favour the big pharmaceutical companies and their lobbyists ? #% A recent UK government report has recommended restrictions to child use of mobiles as a developing brain is more sensitive to electromagnetic radiation . #% Mr President , this is really one of the worst pieces of legislation I have seen in this Parliament . #% I am also rapporteur on the two regulations dealing with the continuation of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights in 2005 and 2006 . #% The current priorities are putting the banking system in order , working closely with other pillars and KFOR to provide essential supplies , shelter and transport in advance of winter , preparing with the World Bank and the IMF a simplified budget and working on fiscal issues and drawing up with the World Bank a medium-term investment framework to be presented to the next pledging conference . #% Therefore I do not see any competitive disadvantage as far as any companies are concerned because all companies will have to make the same changes . #% If applicant countries have to say that will adhere to it before membership , surely current members should adhere to it now . #% It is also wrong for one particular Member State to exert enormous political pressure to try and have hake removed from this report and then try to get more fish for itself . #% In this instance , is it the case that it will be possible to speed up the procedure under the rapid reaction process for taking something out of the marketplace once it is perceived to be dangerous ? #% My concern also is that the Council only says it will consider these proposals . #% That is the nanny state mentality gone too far . #% Indeed , after exhaustive enquiries , many have been returned home , including three juveniles -- one who in an interview to the British press testified to the humanity of his captors and was grateful for formal English-language instruction on the base . #% Secondly , colleagues will be aware that the UK has chosen at this stage , for well-documented reasons by way of a protocol , not to opt into this directive , but I sincerely hope that in the future it will be able to opt in . #% My group would certainly endorse the three principles which reflect that continuum to which I referred : trying to get our estimates more and more based on the principles of zero-based budgeting , taking strong account when fixing the budget of the implementation of the appropriations that have been placed in previous budgets and an insistence that demands for new appropriations should be backed by appropriate supporting documentation . #% Do you consider that ECHO has been able and will continue to be able to prioritise these needs as they occur on an annual basis in Bangladesh ? #% For many people it is less than the cost of a cup of coffee or a newspaper . #% We must make it very clear that we are not prepared to allow them to abuse what we wanted as economic benefits . #% I also echo what Mr Posselt said , that no one in this House or anywhere else should fail to understand the critical importance of free people in free institutions , communicating their concern about those who are not free and who suffer because of their efforts to observe or assert their own opinions and beliefs . #% We can not afford further delays . #% Again , is this a coincidence ? #% Since the motion of censure was originally devised , Commissioner Solbes has resigned and returned to Spanish politics . #% Commissioner , do you not see a parallel with that in the arguments from sugar beet growers in Europe , not least in the UK , who also call for an orderly market with , as they say , European price levels that would allow both domestic and developing country industries to invest for a sustainable future ? #% Moreover , it is necessary to comply with WTO rules . #% Are there questions here about endangering trade talks , meaning that one should not throw suspicion on any other states ? #% In particular , this report called for funding to Eurojust and Europol , agencies that operate outside of the boundaries acceptable to British law . #% This in itself has proved to be a difficult exercise . #% What the report does say is that there are significant and damaging delays in payments to localities and regions and that some governments deliberately ignore the principle of additionality and use structural fund moneys to pay the wages of their own civil servants . #% What we need to do is get on with our business and start enforcing the laws that we already have . #% That does not , however , mean that the Socialist Group agrees with all that is set down in the 1995 report or , indeed , the rapporteur 's gloss on it . #% These substances which have a potential for harm to the environment must be strictly controlled . #% So , while we have taken part in the debate , and also in the vote to curb the interventionist excesses of the Left , Conservative MEPs abstained on the final vote . #% Regulatory burdens and the reduction of regulatory burdens is a subject which is thick with rhetoric and clichés , but rather thin on action and practicality . #% I would ask you to ask the political groups and Parliament to try to ensure that when there are heads of state or prime ministers speaking in this Parliament there are not other meetings happening at the same time , which give people the opportunity to walk out . #% Regarding the other lines , we do not have many concerns about the consumer lines where we see that the work is going on quite effectively , but I would draw the attention of the House and the Commission to the health programme and the health budget lines . #% Let me make our position clear , in light of the rapporteur 's final conclusions in his speech concerning the issue of a temporary committee : it is ` no ' to any dilution of Amendment No 11 and it is ` no ' to any alteration to a future temporary committee 's remit . #% Only five States out of 15 have met the Barcelona targets for implementation . #% It is important that catering waste is included in these proposals . #% The second issue of particular importance to my group is universal services provision . #% I rise , Madam President , to seek your support and in fact the support of the President of the Parliament for relief for the devastating floods and the effect of those floods in my constituency over the Easter weekend . #% I should also like to concur with his remarks this morning concerning all the Baltic countries and their common progress towards EU membership . #% I recall talking with the counsellor in the British Embassy dealing with Belgium and the Benelux countries and exports into those countries , who told me that the vast majority , over 90 % of the enquiries which he deals with , are not from large companies seeking to export but from small businesses . #% And I have in mind successive British governments as well as others . #% What we have seen is a declaration on access to medicines and public health . #% It is not the other way round . #% We support the move to include pre-retirement benefits for however long they continue to exist , given current moves to extend working lives , and paternity benefits . #% I wonder whether he agrees with me that the pressure exerted by the larger groups to have signatures withdrawn from the motion of censure was an affront to democracy and transparency , and brought shame and disrepute on this House ? #% If that is the case , it is not a sufficient answer to give to those whose primary concern is - as is the Commission 's - food safety . #% They gave the game away in their interventions . #% These visitors appealed to us to understand that , in their words , Russia was fighting against terrorism and was not waging a real war , and that this fight against terrorism had been exacerbated by outside arms flows and training camps sponsored by predatory nations jealous of Russia ' s power . #% The prospect of conflicting authorities being announced in the two courts is bureaucratically intolerable and a judicial nightmare . #% I , on behalf of my group , have followed the report by Mr Sterckx with regard to safety more closely than the others . #% Remember that the Council of Ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March . #% Commissioner Byrne , when talking about the economic partnership agreements , should answer the questions that the Commission has refused to answer , before the process begins . #% That is not freedom : that is being answerable for using a service that is intended to free you . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , many in this House will remember that at first reading , this was an extremely hot topic , and I think we are hearing only some of the differences between us . #% I too support Mrs Junker 's amendments and others on the same point . #% The need for transparency is rightly stressed , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does . #% The effects we have seen in the natural environment have tended to be water-borne and to affect fish , shellfish , some birds and other animals which feed on marine life . #% I would ask that we vote for this now . #% I suppose I feel particularly peeved because my own report on e-Europe , which is the only thing from this Parliament before the Lisbon Summit , has been squeezed off to a time when there will be a relatively poor attendance . #% We need to look again at the definitions of legislative and non-legislative texts in relation to public access to documents , in order to ensure that all the institutions are working in an open and transparent manner . #% 
There are real difficulties in implementing a fixed-term worker comparative for pay in the case of assignments of a short duration . #% It is clear that the prosecution is a vexatious one , by a private organisation , designed to deprive Mr Gollnisch of his elected position and his good name . #% It strengthens the political accountability of the Commission to Parliament , especially through the commitment of President Barroso that we see in clause 3 with respect to a loss of parliamentary confidence in an individual Commissioner . #% If I may say so , Madam Commissioner , this is a massive undertaking , and - borrowing some space age jargon - may I say that the Commission here is ` boldly going where no Commission has ever gone before ' . #% I wonder whether that means that the UK Independence Party is now transferring in its entirety , or at least the two Members who are present here , to the other group . #% I urge every Member State to sign up to the European guidelines but , more importantly , to implement those guidelines . #% It offers the ` discerning sportsman ' the ultimate hunting experience : large buffalo , lion , water buck , very rare East African sitatunga , leopards , antelopes , etc. . #% All participants should be free to participate . #% But let us turn to some of the contentious points in the report . #% There is now a clear need for a clear and new interpretation of TRIPS allowing for the flexibility which clearly exists in that agreement . #% I am sure he is old enough in this Parliament - I am speaking of his experience of course and not his age - to understand why at this juncture I could not . #% It is amazing that reportedly over EUR 100 billion remains unspent , due in large part to lack of action by national governments . #% In the North Sea cod is disappearing . #% I call on him to press the undoubted case that Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians in the occupied territories is illegal under the fourth Geneva Convention . #% Politicians have a crucial role in establishing a climate that rejects violence and hate speech : it is part of establishing an inclusive society . #% But you have to start by respecting the procedures that are agreed already , that are known and that are laid down in writing . #% After all , the Taiwan Straits remain one of the world 's most dangerous flashpoints and the USA is obliged to intervene to protect Taiwan militarily in the event of hostilities . #% The same applies to your dentist , your nurse , your pharmacist and to other professions , too , such as the architect who has built your house . #% For example , the British army is at the moment more fully committed than at any time since the Second World War . #% UK Conservative MEPs agree , and we urge the UK Labour MEPs , who supported this report so resolutely in committee , now to support the common position , and meanwhile to support our compromise , tabled jointly by a number of political groups . #% Yet there is , in my opinion , no climate of fear in Havana , such as that I have witnessed in Kashmir or , until recently , Aceh . #% Yet this scheme could be blocked with its enormous positive benefits by the fine print of the Habitats Directive leaving the unsafe alternative of nuclear power , which is infinitely more polluting to habitats across the world . #% I did serve , however , representing Cornwall and Plymouth . #% With Mr Deva we ask those questions of you , Mr Patten , and if we do not get satisfactory answers the Socialists on this side of the House will be supporting Mr Deva in taking a very different stance on this report altogether . #% Those in non-standard work should be given greater security , for instance an occupational status . #% In that situation the decision of the European Union - or European Community as it was then - was made under very different procedures which did not involve co-decision . #% However , what we can have is much more efficient and effective defence expenditure . #% This will help businesses across Wales , and I am disappointed that colleagues from UKIP were unable to support this progressive initiative . #% As you said , Commissioner , it is largely about the development of effective technical standards for products . #% For obvious reasons , public opinion has to be assured that this is the case . #% Indeed , the case was to be brought to court but was put on hold when the Commission agreed to work to produce validation systems for the test methods by the end of this year ; so we can test these and test the alternatives . #% In addition to this , the EuroMed tenth anniversary summit on 27 and 28 November in Barcelona represented an important opportunity to help the EU 's Mediterranean partners , including Tunisia , to address the challenges of the 21st century , including in relation to good governance . #% It seems that in various complimentary ways these three measures will help to improve matters . #% Just a quick second point . #% My group sees the value of social security , not just to assist the sustainability of income , but as a measure of social inclusion as well . #% We are satisfied with the outcome of these opportunities afforded to us in this new procedure . #% In such circumstances a close degree of cooperation and coordination makes common sense , not just for travellers and parliamentarians but for all our citizens who need protection in many more ways than the very simple small example I have just set out . #% So we hope that when the Vienna summit meeting is concluded there are concrete measures linked to the employment action plans of each Member State that will help to bring down the overall unemployment level , but particularly long-term unemployment and unemployment amongst young people . #% The same could be true of something like smoking . #% Finally , I want to stress , as the Convention is coming to a conclusion , the importance of maintaining the Commission 's role in monitoring the implementation of Community law . #% In the proposals here , there have been some significant improvements about the straightforward core of the proposal : about how fibres are labelled , about how composition is labelled and about clarity of labelling . #% European and worldwide support for their cause is weakened with every suicide bombing . #% It changed all our lives in the 20th Century . #% I know that Mr de Roo has instructed me in the past about how the process and the importance of it can not be overestimated , pointing for example at the way in which the Montreal Protocol has been developed into a really effective instrument from a rather poor beginning over the past decade . #% However , we have found ourselves in an invidious position over the difference of opinion we have , as shown in the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on Directives 92/50/EEC , 93/36/EEC and 93/37/EEC , where we voted for transparency , and Directive 93/38/EEC , where we did not . #% In order for the EU 2020 strategy to work , we need a strong , coordinated approach . #% However , we ask the Commission , by its own initiative , to involve the European Parliament more systematically in the assessment of the implementation of the human rights clauses and similar requirements in the future . #% I am a farmer who farmed through the BSE crisis in the UK . #% First , to promote mandatory targets for energy efficiency across the European Union . #% We certainly need stirring up . #% I agree with Mr Schulz . #% These workers were exposed to radiation levels three thousand times above the permitted levels . #% A just war to the extent that any such thing might be claimed to exist can only be pursued when all peaceful means have been exhausted . #% May I thank the Council for its very brief response , though I had been hoping for a little more . #% I applaud everyone involved in this very forward-thinking scheme . #% Human rights clauses have been invoked in at least 12 cases since 1995 as a basis for consultation , suspension of aid or other measures involving 10 ACP countries . #% But more action is needed and it must be more systematic and automatic after a reasonable time period , not decades . #% Mr President , you said that recorded votes cost 4 million from Parliament ' s budget . #% That has enormous implications for the social inclusion policies that we pursue and , as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I want to pick up -- as others have done -- on the world of work , focusing in particular on paragraph 27 of the report . #% We pushed hard at that time for a strengthening of the African Union monitoring mission , and in October 2004 it was indeed extended to include the protection of civilians who were under imminent threat . #% This will be a matter for another rapporteur , I know , but given that the EUR 1.2 million initially required rose to 1.9 million , as the Commissioner has just said , and 2.8 million is being requested for next year , I would urge the greatest of caution , because we expect better financial management than this . #% Very often we explain them in terms of rights and responsibilities , the freedoms and rights of the single market and the social and legal responsibilities which are fundamental to its fair achievement . #% Many of them make the biggest financial investment they will ever make in their lives by purchasing real property . #% The basis of our approach must be mutual recognition , showing respect for our differing legal traditions and cultures . #% One of them is one in which I have a registered interest , namely the question of Media-Most , and the alternative television system of Russia . #% So I certainly welcome the fact that they wish to cooperate with us in trying to reduce the backlog of commitments , in trying to make sure that there is a better parallel between the legislative and budgetary procedures and that performance targets are set , particularly in Category 4 in external policy . #% 
We need to find a way to bring all the actors together in what we have called a partnership agreement , because I am certain that if , with the arrival of the US President , the opportunity is taken by the incoming administrations on both sides to shape a new strengthened transatlantic partnership , we all will be beneficiaries . #% This language is as close to the Commission 's text as possible , in order to ensure that the same interpretation of precluding competition is applied . #% I urge our Turkish friends to consider the proposal of Germany 's Angela Merkel for a privileged partnership . #% Which common foreign and security policy is that ? #% I want to assure the House that , contrary to the Belgian Government report , it is a respectable missionary organization . #% Mr President , my colleague from the PPE-DE Group , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , says that the rapporteur , Mr Ferri , has accused her of being conservative . #% It will then be possible to make accurate comparisons between the price paid by the Commission - which is stable - and market rates which are patently not going to go down in the parts of Brussels which are of particular interest to us . #% In Japan I have been to the research laboratories of DoCoMo , the Japanese telecoms company , where they have people inventing third generation commercial applications . #% This is an important political opportunity which should not be wasted and I am glad to hear that the Commission is taking a pragmatic view on its right of initiative . #% However , it is extremely frustrating that nearly 200 men remain there . #% I genuinely believe that the ECON compromise would be good for all Member States . #% Does it mean that there has to be a revision of all the Staff Regulations , which are common between all the institutions ? #% That is the language we used in the report from the Temporary Committee . #% So I am delighted that we have moved in this direction . #% So I am very pleased that this has now been rectified and we can move forward to produce the sort of governmental structure which we require . #% They will foster enlightened attitudes and they will improve the morale and living conditions of many of the valued staff who work for the European Union in the different institutions . #% There is an absorption problem : the Afghan Interim Government lacks the institutions to disburse the money efficiently and needs greater assistance in this area . #% However , one of my disappointments about the resolution which finally emerged is that we only make a glancing mention of the word ` family ' in paragraph 1 , when we refer to the courage of those families that have been victims of child abuse in Belgium . #% There could effectively be no democratic oversight of this Treaty , because it is clear -- not least from what the Council has said tonight -- that the real decisions will be taken by the unelected Permanent High Level Group rather than by ministers themselves . #% However , I believe that fudges of the kind perpetrated in June and again at the beginning of this month will not solve the underlying potential difficulties we have with our trade with China . #% I have been there and it really is a restricted area . #% We are not convinced that it is for the European Union to be the body that imposes unwanted restrictions , that have nothing to do with health and safety , on individuals in every Member State . #% You simply can not do your job and you are overseeing a regime that is laced with protectionism and sheer hypocrisy as we , of course , subsidise our own agriculture and will keep export subsidies in place until 2013 . #% Will it address the fundamental concerns of 450 million people struggling to earn a living or find solutions to everyday problems ? #% Therefore my Group can not accept that concept . #% I believe our resolution is clear and I hope it gets the support it deserves . #% If we could separate politics and religion , I tell you now that the world would be a safer and better place in which to live . #% When Europe is faced by some of its greatest challenges , such as how to prepare for next year 's enlargement , we have a presidency that appears to have been so distracted by internal affairs that it has not properly prepared for its presidency . #% Mr President , although it would have been better if we had voted at lunchtime , I am happy to go ahead now . #% I regret that people in Austria have allowed themselves to be ruled by emotion , not rational scientific argument . #% North is not the same as the south , Wales and Scotland are different to the south-east - and that was under Gordon Brown as Chancellor for 10 years . #% I am very much against the idea of prejudicing the whole debate by deciding now what we are going to do . #% There have been too many unexplained deaths in Sri Lanka , whether it was that of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar or the Tamil MP Joseph Pararajasingham , both of whom I and others had met and both of whom had been present in this Chamber . #% In compiling and adopting all of these proposals for consultation , we have naturally given close attention to budgetary implications . #% I therefore agree with my colleague Reimer Böge when he says that we support this , but we would insist on inserting the PM line . #% This has been a great attribute right the way through . #% I particularly commend the rapporteur on the way he has worked hard to absorb amendments from colleagues from different parties , who also care strongly about this issue . #% Mr Lehne , to whom I would like to pay tribute , has certainly worked very hard , as I did , on a text that would have satisfied the PSE Group , even though the position on takeovers , as we have seen , is effectively unchanged . #% The real question for the rapporteur is whether we want to put all those positive benefits at risk by attaching to this proposal an issue about country-of-origin marking , which - as Mrs Rühle quite rightly points out - has already been proposed by the Commission on a whole range of products . #% We also need to press on with our agenda for the environment , with climate change , emissions trading , air quality , waste reduction , reuse and recycling , noise and the urban environment , the protection of wildlife and habitats , and a reduction in animal testing . #% Mr President , I should like to clarify whether this resolution is compatible with the resolution that we passed in January of this year , drawing attention to the problems of the prisoners of war who are still in Kuwait , or whether this resolution is to be taken as contradictory to our resolution of January of this year ? #% Although the exceptions are optional and can be adapted to national law at the will of the Member States , the amendments as they stand at present would introduce the obligation to introduce fair compensation . #% In Darfur , the UN says that some 200 000 people have died and two million have been displaced since that conflict began in 2003 . #% That will allow digital authors to come on and have a common set of principles within which they can develop programmes for any platform . #% We must also ensure that where regional policy objectives apply , they and agriculture policies cooperate rather than compete . #% Whilst expressing gratitude to both of them I would also like to express my thanks to the House for agreeing to bring forward consideration of this report in plenary . #% Firstly , we thoroughly endorse the Commissioner 's opening statement about avoiding over-regulation . #% Thanks to the President-in-Office for that answer , and indeed for the support of his own government in respect of this point . #% This is not just a matter for big business : it is of great concern to little consumers , millions of them throughout the EU who wish for and deserve the right to choose , without having pejorative labelling applied to the product . #% Clearly that is entirely inconsistent . #% Is it because Afghanistan is an Islamic society ? #% She has indicated general assent with most of these exclusions . #% That is not inconsistent with taking the view that we have now reached the end of the road in that respect . #% We want to see a review of the law on collective redundancies , a review on transfers , a review of the European Works Council Directive , to make sure it is a directive that is observed rather than being systematically avoided by business . #% The response I received to a Parliamentary question last week from the Commission was dismissive of Parliament 's call made in September for such a uniform and compulsory code . #% It is logical that if we have a single market there should be a single system of company registration , which ought to make registration simpler and reduce red tape . #% I reject claims regarding the legality of the cull . #% We strongly believe that national parliaments and not the European Parliament should lay down laws relating , for example , to eviction of violent partners . #% I must agree with that analysis and , whilst enjoying Mr Straw 's speech today , I can not see that it takes us anywhere useful at all . #% If your checks are so thorough , why do you not give us , the Parliament , a figure that we have requested for many years now , which is the percentage of money lost through fraud , mismanagement and waste - a figure you used to give us to allow us to have a benchmark to see if things are materially getting better . #% I will leave such decisions to my political group . #% I am concerned about the precedent that this proposal will set . #% It was the one key issue where the public were definitely and clearly on our side . #% We have strengthened the public 's right to information . #% So we would like to know on what date that decision was taken . #% Or to demonstrate the risk posed by extremists and prove the President 's anti-terrorist stance to the West , which has been more critical recently , with claims now that the all-powerful Pakistani Military Interservices Intelligence Agency has been secretly helping Taliban forces regroup in the border areas with Afghanistan ? #% 
In Europe it is our fault and in Africa it is also too often our fault . #% This is an internal British squabble . #% We can sometimes make gestures at first reading , securing major amendments for radical reform , but they matter not at all if we can not get agreement at second reading , if we can not secure that qualified majority ; and to make progress we need to take account both of our ambitions for the environment and of legitimate concerns for industry . #% We had valuable discussions in Bamako and in Edinburgh and this Parliament , I am sure , will take the ACP views into account . #% I commend Commissioner Byrne 's team for their work . #% Since this signified the possibility that an approach that conformed with Community law could be established , the Commission then suspended the infringement procedure . #% The first is the assessment of needs for the western Balkans . #% There is a similar case going on in Belgium over Charleroi . #% This is not so . #% If we have enquiries in the future , let us try to carry them out within the budget and not give rise to excess expenditure . #% The former Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights , Mr Gil-Robles , said that some time in around 2002 or 2003 he saw detainees -- prisoners -- in Guantánamo-type orange jumpsuits , apparently detained by KFOR , but was not able to pursue the matter . #% The Lisbon 2002 objective requires constant hard slog and a consistently-applied approach across many policy fields , not an endless diet of symbolic and tokenistic rhetoric . #% There is more than enough room , even with the enlargement countries , to provide all the necessary facilities . #% Really , how do we get the money that we promised for adaptation and forest protection ? #% The PCBs directive is characterised by the failure of Member States to supply the all-important inventories of the stocks they hold . #% There have been no shadows in this report ; we have been equal rapporteurs , equal participants and without them we could not have presented this document today . #% That is where the provisional administration of Kosovo is based and all the agencies and organisations responsible for reconstruction in the region are located . #% I have said before that , if the EU is the answer , it must have been a stupid question . #% We must accept that Kosovo is important historically and traditionally to the Serb nation and we must not replace fear of one set of people by fear of another . #% There is the reform of the CAP , there are the new GATT negotiations , so is it not likely that they will be both outdated and meaningless in the timescale being dealt with ? #% Therefore I oppose the position taken by Mr Evans and others that this Parliament should tell Member States what procedure they should use to ratify and we will be seeking to amend that paragraph accordingly . #% This is a price that we can not continue to pay and therefore these reports are absolutely necessary to avoid further damage , decay and death in Europe . #% Culture change takes time . #% I also agreed both with him and with Minister Roche when they spoke of the need to develop a modern interpretation of the Geneva Convention on refugees . #% At present the dispossessed feel they have no stake in the future and that , under anybody ' s reasoning , is a wicked waste . #% I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition . #% In the meantime though , enforce and implement the regulations as we expect them to be enforced and implemented . #% Many of them - the large majority I believe - have been genuinely concerned that Parliament ' s procedures have not given them adequate time to consider the detail . #% Mr President , we welcome this resolution on human rights in Nepal , particularly because the Socialist International Asia-Pacific Committee in Ulan Bator recently expressed its grave concern over the deteriorating situation in that country since the February coup d'état . #% This should also apply regarding the matter of training , which also varies considerably . #% These are matters which we and our party back home are clear on and we can not go along with them . #% Progress on the ground has been very disappointing . #% Mr President , last week 's European Council was a clear reminder that the European Union can not carry on with business as usual following the French and Dutch votes on the Constitution . #% I would like to hear how he intends to improve coordination of the national indicative programmes for Cotonou and about our involvement in the steering committee working on education in Africa . #% I know that it is a particular problem for the United Kingdom , but it is not exclusive to the United Kingdom . #% It is ruled by a tyrant , a predator , whose hunger for territory has led his army across into the Islamic Republic of Iran ; he initiated the Iran-Iraq war - a million people died . #% It will facilitate the free movement of people , goods and services by making eGovernment applications more accessible across national boundaries . #% Now he ( Häider ) is threatening us . '' #% I also regret the lack of formal consultation with the social partners , which could have addressed some of these concerns and made the agreement all the more effective . #% The practice can not be accepted for much longer . #% We do not convict terrorists , but we are at best passive with regard to human rights breaches in the war on terror . #% It also has to be recognised that , since much of this law is made up of directives which have to be transposed into the Member States ' domestic legal systems , once they have been transposed , the instrument concerned belongs to domestic law and any infringement must be dealt with by the national courts . #% I am very glad that one important principle is enshrined in this report as it goes through to the next stage : animal feed should be taken as seriously for all of us in our own interests as human food . #% Since we have the social dialogue , what knowledge do we have of industrial relations throughout the European Union and what particular safeguards and institutional devices do we need to acquire to ensure the progress of industrial relations throughout the European Community . #% No prisoners of war during the Second World War were allowed to have a fair trial -- everyone knows that they were detained for the duration of war . #% The gunmen tied him and his wife to a chair and , as she pleaded for their lives , the Brigade member told her : ' His time has come ' . #% Mr President , one of the key characteristics of the global fishing situation at the moment is that stocks worldwide are heavily depleted . #% Only a united front by other members and the observers on the Arctic Council , working through the EU 's Northern Dimension policy , will keep the Kremlin in check . #% All cigarettes are harmful . #% I would like to respond to the first floor speaker today who asked if any Members had previously had better offices ; we had such fine offices here , had we ever had better ones ? #% We look forward to working with you and I know all my colleagues on these new benches look forward to you treating them fairly and , I hope , giving them the democratic respect which I know they all deserve . #% The prospect of European Union affiliation or membership is a great incentive for countries that have lived under communism for many generations to put their political and economic house in order and to resolve long-standing problems with neighbouring states . #% Mr President , we used to have a joke in the United Kingdom about there being fog in the Channel and the continent therefore being cut off . #% The SLORC and military junta is clearly a regime that we can not deal with or indeed make deals with . #% In less than four months , the Council will take that final important decision , and as a Parliament we have to look beyond that decision of 2 May and the start of the EMU on 1 January 1999 and set ourselves a new agenda within the European Parliament . #% LIFE + is the new financial instrument that , with the Structural Funds and Fund for Rural Development , will enable Natura 2000 to continue to succeed . #% The statement by President Putin that they voluntarily agreed to be annexed by the Soviet Union is laughable . #% Might there not be a suspicion , in fact , that he has been about the same kind of activity within the EU ? #% Mr President , I am glad to be able to raise this matter in the presence of the Commissioner for Transport , Mrs de Palacio , because it is scandalous that the French Government obliges us to come to Strasbourg and has exercised political and emotional pressure - some would say blackmail - to keep us here , but fails both to get a TGV line built and , even as owner of Air France , to ensure decent air services to this beautiful but inconveniently located city . #% If this is not a formal communication , I would like to know what is . #% We also want close monitoring of mergers , specific action towards emerging activities such as biotechnology , on which we are trying to cooperate with Commissioner Bangemann at the moment to secure rational proposals for the European Union , and of course we want the promotion of responsible selfmedication . #% Apparently this is now in contravention of an EU directive , although there is a legal doubt about this . #% This is not an addition but a rewording , because the original proposal - which was a rather elegant , all-embracing one from the Commission - had to be changed because the issue of third-country nationals was dealt with some time ago in a separate proposal under the able rapporteurship of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten . #% It is an excellent step forward . #% The cause of decency and humanity is well served by the interest demonstrated by this House , especially in the way in which honourable Members were able to illustrate their concern and arguments by reference to the reality of the wretchedness inflicted on the people of Aceh . #% Given that our key concerns remain , British Labour MEPs are going to be consistent . #% 
Arguably , it is even more important that , when legislation that does not necessarily need the approval of this House is enacted by the Council , it is enacted as transparently as possible . #% The EU has , it seems to me , made a mountain out of a molehill . #% We should not be setting standards for these things . #% In France , for example , there is not , according to my information , one single piece of rolling stock running on railways that is not manufactured in France , and yet in the United Kingdom a large number of rolling stock units are imported from across Europe . #% But a particular thing I want to come back to this afternoon is a point that I was very interested to read about in the Commission 's report on Community measures affecting tourism and that is the health and physical safety of tourists . #% One Commission fell , another came into office accepting that something of this sort should happen and it is that proposal from President Prodi , driven forward by the Commissioner , which we are dealing with today . #% I think that is all we can do . #% The alternative will be a domino effect in which all the problems of delay continue for seven more years , blighting the achievements of programmes of which we should be justifiably proud . #% Once our accession colleagues arrive , this problem is only going to get worse because they have even worse connections to Strasbourg . #% However , I wish to say most emphatically that , if progress is to be made to everyone 's liking , budgetary neutrality must be observed in all of the institutions that implement a scheme of this kind . #% Mr President , in welcoming Mr Duisenberg here today , I also congratulate Mr Fourçans for his commentary on the EMI 's final and historic report . #% It is a scientific fact that most of our renewable energy technology does not work . #% The health of the European economy depends on this legislation . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Friedmann and the Court on their best-seller report again this year . #% Of course there will be problems on specific points . #% I only regret that the benches of the House are not as full as the public gallery . #% However , when I first came across the European Protection Order , I thought it sounded scary , like the European Arrest Warrant , which , in my opinion , is one of the most intrusive and dictatorial pieces of legislation ever to be imposed on the British people . #% Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created . #% They recognise the important role of national parliaments , but reject the argument for a further second chamber . #% The second amendment , regarding energy policy , has been adequately covered in the compromise language already in the text of my report . #% On this issue I must say to the Commissioner - and I hope she will take this back to Mr Liikanen - that we in this House have had a debate which has continued through a number of Parliaments , through pretty much the entire parliamentary lifetime of everyone sitting in this Chamber now , from 1993 onwards . #% Mr Virrankoski obviously shows great understanding and I know his background really gives him an authority in this area . #% Thousands of pages of text , most of it too complicated for our citizens ever to understand , simply consumes the trees that we need to protect . #% I am sure he would agree with me that it is very sad that on an issue like this , which covers the pages of many of our newspapers , there is - to the best of my knowledge - no press here to cover it . #% It is not colonialism to stand up for the rights of others . #% Will the Council do everything possible to ensure this ? - because it is crucial . #% He has also used his artistic talents to raise awareness of China 's dismal human rights record and dearth of political freedom . #% Mr President , there must be a common and effective EU contribution to the success of the UN World Conference Against Racism next year and its European preparatory conference next month . #% The truth is that prohibition is not the solution to the problems , it is the principal cause of them . #% So we have an effective veto . #% I agree absolutely with the amendment that has been tabled here reinstating the first reading position . #% I am confident that these problems will be dealt with and taken into account by the Commission and that an effective trade agreement will be agreed . #% We equally ask that all the states in the region refrain from any actions that might contribute to instability in Liberia and on the borders between Guinea , Sierra Leone and the Côte d'Ivoire . #% It taught me to be a good , contributing citizen who is proud to be European and British . #% We in Europe very much want a sustainable fisheries policy . #% How many of you have done that ? #% I am always impressed by the range of human rights issues on which Members of the European Parliament are active . #% Police forces that see themselves as some kind of external force coming in to impose rules and operations which are not acceptable to the community at large will fail . #% Again , our experience is that these systems are far from adequate . #% The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT . #% I applaud the rapporteur for introducing a time limit for the Council decision . #% With enlargement we have to be most careful that we use money to the best advantage , right across the board . #% Now that the economic collapse has forced the resignation of President Suharto , there is at last hope of fundamental change . #% Intermediaries should be much clearer about the role of European support and all Member States should operate a reserve list system to help eligible companies who were not first in the queue . #% Last September , David Cameron was quoted in the as ` fighting to end the EU 's damaging social role ' and leaving it to focus on ` making the single market work properly ' . #% I , Hanja Maij-Weggen , my ex-co-rapporteur , and all the draftsmen of opinions and some shadows for the other Committees embarked on a series of meetings with the Council and the Commission , latterly called trialogues , in order to reach this compromise . #% We are concerned with the production , sale , distribution and deliberate possession of pornographic images showing children . #% in writing . - I was delighted to be able to co-author , on behalf of the S&D Group , Parliament 's resolution on Western Sahara . #% This resulted in a series of recommendations this February from Justice Melo 's independent commission , set up specifically to address this issue , followed by a six-point government-endorsed plan to stop further human rights abuses and end the existing climate of impunity . #% We are told that many people want to work longer hours because they really love their jobs -- just as we all do . #% I did the same for the other amendments to this paragraph . #% Well , it is certainly giving a sign that it does not take it seriously at all . #% We can only hope this new initiative succeeds , especially because the EU will be providing ECU 9.5 million to help prepare for the proposed elections in Cambodia later this year . #% I know that you have done your best , Commissioner , while in office . #% We must not fear globalisation , but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society . #% This is an honest report , conducted after an extensive inquiry . #% We need a more nuanced approach to ensure that migration works for them , so we are not going to be voting , for example , to include beneficiaries of humanitarian protection . #% Well , how then do reputable companies perform transparent audits on equal pay for equal work ? #% Therefore , I wish to couple my welcome for today 's reports with that of the analysis of island regions sponsored by the Commission . #% They can not be working in a vacuum . #% Nonetheless , I would ask whether the full text of the Commission 's statement and Mr Prodi 's statement today could be incorporated not just in the Verbatim Report of Proceedings but also in the Minutes , because it was a very significant statement and should be recorded in our Minutes , so that we have a proper record of what the Commission has undertaken to do . #% I welcome the participation of two women in the interim government and I am hopeful that the new generation of younger , progressive and modern political leaders will see the way to establish a new order based on equality of the sexes and on full political and social rights enshrined in their international treaty obligations , and cease to regard women and their role as a purely economic one and a procreative one and banish them to invisibility in their burkas . #% It is also important to address the issue of compensating for and replacing lost energy capacity . #% Well done Commissioner ! #% I commend him on it . #% I am delighted to hear that the Commission will be working in partnership on that and I hope that sufficient priority will be given to tackling this , to ensure that directives such as the tobacco advertising directive will be effective and will not be undercut by these criminals , particularly in the tobacco companies , who must take responsibility for what they are doing : increasing smoking . #% 
We in the Liberal Group will assess this national programme for reform critically but fairly . #% These arms escalate and provoke prolonged conflicts . #% With a framework plan of action for tightening measures for dealing with BSE , I hope we can now remove the crisis of confidence and restore normal trading as soon as possible . #% One of the biggest obstacles to better regulation is our calendar of meetings . #% That was why I know that my fellow rapporteur had a slight problem with the date 2010 . #% We should not include organs in this measure on cells and tissues . #% Mr President , I would first of all like to welcome the Commissioner 's communication which , I believe , is both perceptive and sensible . #% Turning to the religious minorities , there have been extensive assaults recently on Christians and the concomitant lack of aid for the refugees who have fled -- who happen to be Christians and Assyrians -- into nearby Syria and Jordan . #% In the conflict since 1998 , over 5 000 400 people have lost their lives and , indirectly or directly , as many as 45 000 deaths occur every month . #% I believe that the industry has accepted that target , but with some trepidation . #% This may mean ensuring their own compliance and/or that of others with regulations and directives alike . #% However , the main purpose was to reimburse Bulgaria and other countries that had been forced to decommission functioning nuclear reactors , against their better judgment . #% What we need now is for the Council to act quickly and effectively , because the increased efficiency and cost neutrality and the benefit to the operation of the European Union that can derive from the Commission 's proposal last year could be drastically reduced or even lost altogether if any part of the Council prevaricates . #% Like all small businessmen , he is overburdened with red tape and regulation - much of it emanating from this place , the European Parliament . #% My committee has advanced five budget priorities : Objective 1 , 2 , Interreg , transport safety and sustainable mobility . #% Firstly , the rapporteur , Mrs Müller , who has done her job very gallantly , has been subjected to unacceptable harassment and threats . #% Finally , Chancellor Schüssel , it has been most welcome to see your approach to opening up the Council as regards codecision and in inviting parliamentarians to your meetings . #% Let us be clear , there is a very practical paragraph in the joint motion from three parties that would allow a practical process to take off . #% For the price of our national representation we could afford to provide and equip and service a major teaching hospital - with some change left over . #% I have , however , tried not to reinvent the wheel . #% I hope for all those things , but probably a lot of water still has to flow under the bridge before my hopes will be realised . #% The renegotiation should focus on Part III and should carry through the modernisation and reform of the EU 's common economic and social policies of which you so properly speak . #% Explain to the families of 99 trade unionists murdered last year in Colombia , which has the worst record in the world , why Europe actually offers trade preferences to that country for its supposed protection of internationally agreed workers ' rights . #% Madam President , do you want to wait until the meeting has finished here or not ? #% But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them . #% To date there have been six separate UN treaties on human rights . #% That is the situation that exists . #% I congratulate Mr Byrne on his position . #% We regretted that initially there was some slight resistance from the Council but we are very pleased that , as a result of strong intervention by the Commissioner and the negotiating skills of the rapporteur , a compromise was reached last autumn that we can certainly support . #% The Charter represents a chance to build a modern post-national society , and marks a bold step forward from the sorrow and the pity of twentieth-century Europe . #% However , the EPLP does not agree that an EU-wide transaction tax is a necessary vehicle to achieve some of the Lisbon Strategy objectives and did not support this measure . #% The Commission said they were going to produce a document in 1997 about enforcement for the whole of the European Union waters . #% Secondly , let us make sure that it is properly democratic and let us not take decisions which we will regret later because we have taken on countries for which we do not have the financial capacity . #% From the European side , we can offer aid for trade measures to help with this market-building and with supply-side constraints . #% This document sets out a number of clear targets to be achieved in which we , in Parliament and the Council , will have to participate . #% I trust that this Parliament will reinstate this in the text ; that we will commit ourselves , as we did in the vote on my report on the Millennium Development Goals , to this important aspect . #% Mr President , coupled with the election of Hamas , the vote in Israel will have a defining influence on the prospects for peace in the Middle East . #% Whether we like it or not , it is true . #% Of course we need European-level institutions but let us also recall the wise words of Jacques Santer : `` Europe must do less better '' . #% Sadly , Mr Rocard is one of those people , typical in the EU , who increasingly seem to think that the European Patent Office is some sort of subsidiary of the EU , when in fact it covers non-EU countries as well . #% Commissioner , I welcome your reply and thank you for the work I know you have done . #% So why do you not get Gordon Brown to tell the truth to the British people ? #% The polling stations , usually in schools and administered by teachers , were efficient and well organised . #% The Texas authorities pressed ahead with the scheduled execution , despite the fact that a number of key legal appeals had still to be heard by the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals . #% I come from the freight industry where we have had the tachograph for years . #% For us , too , the portability of pension rights is a crucial issue . #% One area which has been drawn to my attention in the last few days is the right for claims to lapse after four years . #% These prove her wrong . #% Finally , I wish to highlight paragraph 111 , to draw attention to the use by some states of torture by proxy and the potential reliance on evidence obtained by such means . #% It falls to the Commission to state clearly what the Constitution says , why it says it , and what the outcome will be if it is not brought into force . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for the full answers that he has given to questions relating to child abuse and to paedophilia . #% The United Kingdom has been at the centre of the BSE epidemic from the beginning but , with the precautionary measures which have now been put into effect , it is entitled to be seen as setting an example in health and safety standards , including the safe storage of rendered carcases . #% Some of those so-called honorary Members have used that title in a way that leads the public to believe that they are still Members of this House . #% It seems that whenever we vote on the A-30 lines , we please very few people and displease a lot of people . #% The OSCE 's report went on to say that freedom of expression was limited and that normal political discourse was almost impossible , partly because of tight constraints on the media . #% This was the case before last September and the situation has been exacerbated since then . #% Farmers will now have a new and safer vaccine available and will be given greater powers over their own vaccination programmes . #% Turning to the cluster bomb issue , I have to say that I have been one of the foremost activists in support of the campaign to ban antipersonnel landmines because our armed forces recognise that their limited military utility is outweighed by the danger that they so often pose to civilians , often many years after a conflict is over . #% Thankfully , a touch of genius from our colleagues in the Social Affairs Committee has meant that the Budgets Committee amendment that will be put forward will ensure that the people who those lines are aimed at are not disadvantaged . #% The limited staff resources available to the Commission in this area will indeed be stretched to breaking point . #% Very often it is necessary to change representatives at the last minute because of the very nature of negotiations that take place in conciliation . #% I know the Commission values the findings of this report and I look forward with great interest to its own report . #% We must now make this EU work for the benefit of its citizens . #% The type of regulation that is absolutely essential for consumers can be damaging , disruptive and unnecessary if applied to professionals . #% All I can say to him at this juncture , because I know this is a matter of continuing concern and activity by him , is that the CMO for olive oil is due to be reformed , as I indicated earlier , by 1 November 2001 , following agreement in the Council and in this Parliament in adopting Regulation 1638/98 . #% At the end of the day it is about getting that agreement , about making sure that the three institutions are working together . #% 
We really need more from the Commission when we get incidents like this . #% It can only devalue our work in the European Parliament if claims can be made , for example , that the end-of-vehicle-life directive will cost us # 400m a year in terms of the cost to the producers and the consumers but will only deliver # 100m a year of benefit to the environment . #% . -- Mr President , there is a certain sense of déjà vu in this debate . #% However , I would also like to commiserate with him because some of our colleagues have displayed a lack of efficiency in their rather profligate use of words in pursuit of the worthy aims of this report . #% It is a very emotive issue , nowhere more so than in the UK . #% I have already had cases drawn to my attention regarding other EU schemes where honest errors by farmers , who are not professional bureaucrats , have resulted in punitive sanctions which often threaten the future of a family farm . #% Yet I think we need to reconsider whether this is the most effective way for an agency that has several different bases to operate . #% It was highlighted in the opinion of the Committee on Employment and relates to sheltered employment . #% Mr President , concerning the voting list and the contentious paragraph 4c of the IGC debate , in our group I argued vigorously that we should be voting for this . #% However , I want to address my words to the Members of this House . #% Regarding information and training , in the past this budget line has been allocated for information , communication and training . #% Sanctions will be suspended when Saddam complies with certain conditions , primarily in relation to the monitoring of his weapons of mass destruction capacity . #% That is not the institution that we are creating here in Europe today and we wish to have no part of it . #% After the vote , I will be calling upon the Commission to report back to Parliament on how the Commissioner 's team will now proceed . #% On category 4 , we also need to find a solution together with the Council . #% As regards uses in other areas , there are some key and essential uses and we want to examine them carefully before we move forward with an amendment that originated with me -- Amendment No 89 -- which asks for an orderly phase-out over a period of time after this directive is brought into force . #% It is not easy to balance the delivery of additional production rights to young farmers if they have to be taken away from existing farmers who themselves are already facing financial difficulties . #% We therefore abstained in the vote on the resolution as a whole . #% The Commission has already sent a document to the Council presidency and to Parliament in which it proposes a clear functional division of the agency services and staff between Pristina and Thessaloniki , with all the operational services concentrated in Pristina and the agency ' s director based there at its centre of operations . #% Having said that , I am very critical of this document overall . #% We also fully support the view that the governing principle must be that of international obligations , fairly and humanely applied . #% President Mugabe is a tyrant who has plundered the resources of his country for his own benefit and that of his cronies and who uses the apparatus of the state , including the police , to terrify and abuse his political opponents . #% This Parliament must avoid duplicating Dick Marty 's investigation . #% Commissioner , you can count on my support , and , I hope , that of Parliament . #% The leader of Hizbollah , Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah , said that he would not have ordered the troops ' capture and kidnapping if he had known that it would lead to full-scale war . #% Finally , I would like to express , on behalf of the ELDR , a profound dissatisfaction that the Council has effectively taken a decision on this dossier without awaiting the opinion of Parliament . #% The Petitions Committee is as anxious as anybody that this report should be published as soon as possible . #% I ask you to invite them formally to abstain from signing the agreement . #% This would not be permissible were they classified as prisoners of war under the 1949 Geneva Convention , since POWs are only obliged to divulge their name , rank and number , whereas unlawful combatants - their correct classification , in my view , according to the provisions of Article 4 ( 2 ) of the Geneva Convention - can be interrogated . #% I have to say I do not know what conclusion to draw because it is clear from the vote that , in fact , after making that promise the vast majority of the PPE actually voted against the resolution . #% One of the problems with the report is that it contains a huge amount of material and potential actions and priorities will therefore have to be set . #% Thirdly , we expressed , in very explicit terms , that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty ; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld . #% What Mr Miranda says is correct , but it is misleading to say that is an amendment . #% When I thought about it , I put it down to the excellent quality of food I had enjoyed during those three days : fresh fruit , vegetables , fresh fish and meat and the most delicious bread I have ever tasted . #% However , in no way does voting in this manner imply any support whatsoever for the political group that tabled the amendment . #% As far as boat angling is concerned , the door with all of this is open for everybody being required to have licences and to report . #% Can I have an assurance that today the secretariat will ensure that our resolution is passed to the Presidency , so that it can brought up at the informal meeting of ministers at Genval near Brussels this weekend and formally put on the agenda of the General Affairs Council on 8 October ? #% Will he go further and say that the 1992 survey showed that most Member States - most but not all - have low rate and efficient payment systems ? #% What we then want is for the Commission to take action or the French Government to back down and allow the free movement of goods through the European Union . #% We would therefore appreciate the Presidency being present at 9 p.m. in order to explain to us what happened at the Agriculture Council last night on the issue on which Mr Papayannakis ' report is based . #% We do not need more directives . #% Which of these two views is right ? #% Nevertheless , in rejecting this report the Conservative delegation shows it too has a schizophrenic quality , since it therefore rejects the excellent amendment by Mr Duff , to give a legal opt-out to Member States , and that of my friend Mr Perry and others , to enable Parliament to put public money where its mouth is by saving wasteful expenditure entailed in the absurdity of these Strasbourg sessions . #% The annex covering the actions undertaken under the three priorities run to around 40 pages . #% This is a patronising and complacent attitude and one that is completely out of date and out of tune with where we are today . #% We need to ensure , in the global market , with global media , that we can protect those parts of our industry which come under attack so often and frivolously on occasion . #% I have to say I am disappointed to see that some of the comments by senior politicians , and even Members of the Commission , suggest that the whole philosophy of an internal market has still to be fully accepted . #% We wanted to set out criteria for the site of the new authority as we believe we should . #% The insistence that the United States share Europe 's view on the ICC is also made plain - despite the problems that an unamended statute would cause for the United States at present . #% I invite the Commissioner to reflect further on this point . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work that he is doing for our House in terms of getting value for money out of our budget . #% I guess it is the big spenders from the Foreign Affairs Committee who are seeing all these commitments being made and we in the Budgets Committee who are querying where the money is coming from . #% Firstly , although he was admirably clear , it would be clearer to us and to everyone if we knew the timetable for agreement in the Council of Ministers and what will happen if there is no agreement by qualified majority voting . #% If not , it should explain why not , because of the risk of destroying the level playing field . #% It is imperative that the parameters of the common immigration and asylum policy should be established before any inner standards - such as those addressed in this report - are set . #% If it does , it will be a welcome addition , but whether it would be agreed by the Council is a different matter . #% These ethnic Russians are being replaced by illegal Chinese migrants , a situation which may cause tensions in the future in that vast , under-populated but resource-rich territory . #% The EU should actively seek to export its strong animal welfare and environmental standards around the world , notably through more open international markets , rather than focusing on defensive , protectionist solutions . #% We are presented with a ludicrous situation in which the repatriation of a corpse from Salzburg to Freilassing -- a distance of ten kilometres -- requires a zinc coffin , but the transfer of a body from Ivalo to Helsinki -- a distance of 1120 kilometres -- requires no such coffin . #% Finally , I would like to ask the Commission and the presidency to flesh out the proposal for a mechanism to suspend the negotiations should there be a crisis . #% The proceedings today have shown that , even when it is not used , it serves a purpose in putting on pressure for amendments to be withdrawn , thereby saving the rest of us a lot of time later in plenary . #% I want to make sure that this instrument is in fact a directive . #% This compromise will not satisfy everybody , but , again , it is a workable compromise for us to move forward at the moment . #% Foot-and-mouth is prevalent in parts of western Africa . #% Services such as tourism and clean taxes could register . #% We must insist on full and proper application of controls across the European Union . #% 
Mr President I should like to thank President Prodi for coming here today . #% President Prodi stated that he was attached to interinstitutional cooperation and full transparency . #% She will appreciate even better than I how far scientific opinion on TSEs has developed . #% Thank you for your help on that : common sense prevails . #% We have to try to explain and simplify it , but we need to explain it to our own constituencies as well as to people outside . #% The annual human rights report this year should be welcomed for its scope and honesty . #% To seek to address these problems by creating an EU-wide database is , however , a mistake . #% Where is the morality in preaching and promoting discrimination and hatred , sometimes behind the shield and the excuse of religion or belief ? #% I have voted against the Report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 2081/92 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs because it approves of the regulation and furthermore does not seek to improve the content or alter the aims of either the former regulation or the Commission proposal . #% This is an issue that many colleagues are concerned about and reflects Article 31 of the proposal . #% We would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets for allowing us to have a say on transfers , in which we are particularly interested . #% Mr President , as the shadow rapporteur , I wish to raise four points on the Gill report . #% Otherwise the danger is that the main burden will only be upon the shareholders . #% If the Finance Minsters of the Member States have some money to spare , I would submit that there are better ways of spending this money than allowing a tax break to continue for the benefit of the alcohol and tobacco industries - available , incidentally , only to international travellers . #% I am asking the Commission , are they going to do anything about it ? #% Mr Solbes might well have gone , but the lack of political responsibility within the Commission remains . #% It has usefully raised the threshold for art work affected to EUR 3 000 but , although the large art galleries and auction houses favour this , as the volume of work is reduced , it does nothing for unknown contemporary artists . #% We need to refocus , to question whether we have a civil justice system in Europe that functions for all the users of the internal market and for our citizens , and is accessible and understandable . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for an extremely comprehensive reply to my question . #% -- Mr President , I have a point of order with regard to the agenda . #% But at least it is the first ombudsman system in a CIS country . #% The highest level of vigilance must continue to be demanded , as Mr Watts has said . #% We should as a Parliament stick to our original desire to tackle money-laundering strongly as a manifestation of organized crime and it seems to me that perhaps this problem will come back to haunt us . #% That is because Member States say they will do something and then do not deliver . #% Is he happy that we are moving in the right direction in terms of implementation ? #% Could the Commission therefore indicate whether it is already monitoring incentives or has plans to do so ? #% I hope that in implementing the directive it will be possible for banks to be more proportionate and targeted in their checks so that individual honest citizens trying to open a bank account are not swamped in red tape , while the arms traffickers , criminal gangs and greedy dictators slip through the net . #% I am sorry to raise such a brass-tacks issue : I know parliamentarians are always shy about raising the matter of their own working conditions but , frankly , unless we can be efficient in dealing with our work , we can not deliver good service and present a good showcase to the world . #% That success was realised . #% Twenty-eight people in my Essex South constituency , 700 people in the United Kingdom as a whole , fell for that false promise and have lost many thousands of pounds in the process . #% . Mr President , Mr Poettering properly reminds us that when Parliament reacted to previous reforms of the Treaties , the resolutions adopted were peppered with regrets , criticisms and things that we deplore , plus demands for further reform . #% Well , I gave my rose to a man . #% If the US can do it , we should do it , and that is why Parliament is seeking to amend this proposal . #% The proposal would allow data over ten years old to be freely shared , reducing if not eliminating the possibility that repeat tests would take place . #% However , some sections of the report which discuss health , education and employment are areas which we believe should be legislated by Member States . #% Hopefully , at the end of this process , we will get a satisfactory outcome . #% I ask Commissioner Nielson if he can give us a time-scale as to when that might be brought forward during the course of next year so we can deal with it properly in the budget process . #% That is why , when we looked at Slovenia , we incorporated a question about their new mental health legislation in our report of two years ago . #% Other Members and Groups with many helpful amendments which I will accept , but there are some I can not accept . #% The purpose of this regulation is to empower consumers to make choices in the single market , by giving them information and allowing them to exercise their choice . #% I call , in particular , on Prime Minister Blair to withhold agreement if they have not been either charged or released by Friday . #% We very much welcome the reiteration of how important it is to legislate to give legally-resident third country nationals rights as near as possible to those of EU citizens . #% I would like them to take away with them this evening the idea that the institutions of the European Union are now embarked upon a genuine process , which will lead to full employment once again in the European Union . #% However , in recent days , like my colleague Mrs Jackson , many of my colleagues on this side have been lobbied heavily by charitable organizations alleging that by voting for the Virgin report , we are about to ban the export of secondhand clothes and other textiles to non-OECD countries . #% Heightened public awareness of the dangers of chemicals in the food chain , growing resistance to antibiotics through over-use and concern about the side-effects of some conventional drugs are all contributing to a massive re-think about the way we live and how we seek to regain our health . #% But , of course , if we achieve what we are seeking with the elimination of the ` BATs ' where the Commission can do the work , then Council and ourselves have to recognise the possible consequences of such a move . #% If Britain should decide to withdraw from the EU and thus cancel its contribution , do you have a Plan B ? #% We want that exemption to continue . #% To give judicial approval to a stoning to death by a legal mob can not be acceptable to the vast majority of Nigerians who are decent and responsible , including their president , and it certainly can not be acceptable to us . #% Do you not know that the discarded fish are dead when they are thrown back ? #% That is now over and we , the representatives of the people , are now charged with conducting further debate on the kind of Europe we want to see . #% Nevertheless , I am sorry to say that the Commission completely ignored Parliament 's wishes at that stage and went on to propose the directive that we are debating today . #% Mr President , I now raise a different point for the Taoiseach . #% If the accounts are so good , why did so many heads of departments refuse to sign their own accounts off without reservations ? #% That is an appalling fact for us to take on board . #% Looking with common sense at how this particular matter proceeded , one can not but feel that something is not quite right , that there is a period of 20 years when nothing seems to happen and no implementation takes place . #% It is precisely because so many governments have failed to grasp the nettle of radical reform that the Lisbon process is in such dire straits . #% Although that programme is currently under review and is due to be reorganised , we felt when we examined it last year that there were a great number of small projects without a great deal of clarity or order to them . #% He ensured that there were six co-rapporteurs from all the different groups appointed to work with him . #% I am reminded that some time ago I visited a Member State embassy in Tokyo . #% Voluntary donation is preferable but not always possible . #% This is certainly the case here where the most restrictive comitology possible is set in place and it will certainly prevent the Commission from acting swiftly and effectively . #% However , we have some particular problems with this piece of legislation , and in particular with chainsaws and the like . #% I will finish by telling you a story . #% The EU should use its economic muscle to insist it will not give preferential deals or favourable treatment to those countries that tolerate the persecution of Christians . #% On behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party , I wish to say that we are strong supporters of a Member Statute being introduced before the 2004 European Parliamentary elections . #% 
I deplore the cynical Green exploitation and misrepresentation of the situation . #% The answer to that will determine the success of your Commission and of the Lisbon Strategy . #% I have always supported and continue to support the liberation of Iraq from Ba'athist tyranny and remain optimistic that eventually we will see a new Iraq emerge which will serve as a catalyst for democratic change elsewhere in the region . #% The only way for Britain to regain control of its immigration and asylum policy is through the UK Independence Party 's policy of Britain 's unconditional withdrawal from the European Union . #% More recently , while stocks have declined , demand from primarily the Far East , the Baltic states and the rest of Europe have removed elvers from the local menu as they have been exported to eel farms . #% If there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ? #% It is all very , very depressing . #% It was the rather traditional story of doling out prizes to Member States . #% There were many cases , as we travelled across the European Union in our quest to find out what had happened , where people said ` thank goodness you are organising a public inquiry ' . #% We should use a real description understood throughout the Community , not an invented one . #% Yes , we need to understand each other , as the Council President has said , but surely we need more collaboration , not just in particular instances , such as the war against terrorism : we need a long-term framework to get to grips with that problem and shift the emphasis from a Community of values to a Community of action , dealing with problems of AIDS in the Third World , nuclear proliferation and a range of other things which Europe and America face jointly as global challenges . #% The current crisis illustrates why many , including the British Conservative Party , reject membership of the euro with the inevitable one-size-fits-all interest rate policy and exchange rates set by factors that may have nothing to do with domestic economic realities . #% Mr President , can I just make a point to our colleague at the back who came in on a point of order , which was not actually a point of order but a criticism . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , Serbia 's progress towards EU membership is gathering pace , and rightly so , as evidenced by the excellent Kacin report . #% Asylum seekers are desperate people escaping in many cases war , violence and torture . #% It was pointed out by many colleagues that we have enough positions of responsibility across this Parliament for most Members who wish to exercise such positions to have one . #% It has purported in recent months to implement both the race directive and the employment framework directive , but in both cases the scope of the new UK regulations falls short in key aspects of the protection conferred by the EU directives . #% Lastly , we need a period of consolidation during this financial perspective period , to make the European Union not only an effective operator internally and externally , but also an operator that is seen to be truly democratic and smooth-functioning . #% On non-agriculture market access the Commission is demanding far-reaching liberalisation that will threaten the very survival of local manufacturing in some developing countries . #% By saying that I am being consistent : I said the same to Mrs Müller in the Green Group when she did that . #% We can only develop our work in guaranteeing the future rights of the consumer , the health of the public and the safe , clean environment if we put our money where our mouth is and spend the cash that is needed . #% We should follow the line that Mrs Kinnock has given , making sure that , whatever we do with these reforms , the developing world is not jeopardised . #% Unfortunately , as well-intentioned as this may be , my understanding is that certainly domestic terrorists , rightly or wrongly , are excluded from the Rome Statute provisions , but it may be that international terrorists could fall under its remit . #% We have a chance today , and in the vote tomorrow , to give a very clear signal . #% Europe , Japan and the US - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block . #% The Commission must establish common methodologies for guaranteeing an adequate level of protection while avoiding distortion of competition . #% Finally , I am one of those Members who believes in the separation of powers , Mr President . #% In the context of the implementation of the principle of availability , of interoperability , of databases , of transfers to third countries -- which become transfers to fourth countries -- I do not see how you are going to be able to hold the line , because it is not happening at the moment . #% Port areas have been better defined to limit the costs imposed on the supply chain outside the geographic area of the port . #% We want to ensure that this budget line is used creatively , including not just visible support for camps , clean water and so on , but the less visible help that is so critical in refugee situations including psycho-social support and counselling , support on reproductive health issues and indeed , support for refugees with disabilities . #% I know that Mr Dupuis is , quite justifiably , passionate about this issue . #% The combination of high temperatures , poor ventilation , overcrowding and lack of water can be lethal . #% Was not Commissioner Byrne right when he said that questions of education , health and housing provision - and their financial implications - are best left to elected politicians rather than judges ? #% We have been , in many ways , guilty of complacency : we say often that the justification of the European Union is to get rid of wars within Europe 's borders and forget what is happening just outside Europe 's borders and our responsibility for that . #% Many animals suffer extreme discomfort during transport and arrive dead or dying at their destination . #% Mr President , I would like to begin by personally congratulating the President - in-Office on his success in achieving a code of conduct on arms exports . #% I wish them well in the remaining time and thank them for their work so far . #% From the Netherlands we have Mrs Kroes , who will take on competition . #% This is the same institution that asks the corporate world to act in a socially responsible way and yet the way in which it has handled this matter so far has been totally socially irresponsible . #% It will no longer be a matter of high foreign policy just about the relationship with Russia . #% I agree that some of the predicted price rises may be alarmist , but there will be price rises . #% But we also need to be aware of the nature of the threat that we are dealing with . #% That really is nonsense and it does not seem to be doing them much good in the opinion polls . #% We must also learn our lessons from these events . #% I currently chair the European Parliament 's delegation for relations with the United States of America and would like to raise a point of order under Parliament 's rules concerning parliamentary delegations . #% Thirdly , there is a problem of lack of independent , objective assessment of the situation and suffering of civilians in the north . #% I have warned that you can not go on buying your own bad debt , but we have reached the point where , within weeks , we may well see that the ECB itself is not solvent , so perhaps your friend Mrs Lagarde can help bail that out as well . #% The United Kingdom should not become a member of Eurojust and should retain its own strong resistance to terrorism . #% Mr President , I would like to draw Parliament 's attention to a case of blatant discrimination that is about to take place in the county of Northamptonshire , which I and my colleague , Mr Helmer , represent . #% It is against that background , Commissioner , that I put my question , because I learn that the European Union 's chief negotiator in the South African trade talks is shortly to be leaving his post . #% We should be clear again today that we are seeing the beginning , not the end , of a process . #% Mr Kim has chosen to withdraw from the NPT and to expel IAEA inspectors , and threatens to reactivate his nuclear weapons programme by switching on the Yongbyong nuclear power station , ostensibly to generate electricity , but no-one is really fooled by this as it is really a source of weapons-grade plutonium for him . #% in writing . - The sentencing of Roxana Saberi on 18 April 2009 for ` spying ' was done without her having any access to a lawyer and on the basis of a trial that was neither fair nor transparent . #% Mr President , the only way to catch international and organised criminals is for our police , prosecutors and judges to work together . #% Which net recipients are prepared to receive less in order to solve the budget problem ? #% It is one thing to talk about a ` European public prosecutor ' , a single official and his/her role , together with the staff , but to turn it into a ` European judicial authority ' manages to compound the problems that I have in relation to Article 280 . #% I am certain that the honourable Member recognises the nature of those limitations . #% When this is in place , we will be able to make certain that not just the fifteen Member States , but twenty-five countries , have policies that are working and are fair to the countries themselves and to applicants . #% Every request must be considered on a case-by-case basis . #% We ought to look at that point . #% What we need is a new direction . #% Perhaps its fundamentalist Islamic revolution will be seen , with the passage of time , as a blip in the curve of its traditionally long historic record of advancement . #% The view of my group is that the avoidance and abuse of this legislation is now of such scale and breadth that we have nothing to lose in insisting on a revision . #% Proposals to set one up are another pretty-sounding excuse for the further advance of an agenda that has nothing to do with patients ' welfare and everything to do with federalist dogma . #% I would like to see every Member elected here on the basis of the commitment and accountability of representing an individual geographical constituency , but I am not so ambitious as to suggest that everybody else should adopt the system I like . #% So if I want to get food I have to queue up in the smoking area or someone has to bring it to my office for me . #% 
In terms of actually reducing tension in that area , the most important thing is to start to implement freedom of movement between Gibraltar and Spain . #% Indeed the British government is asking for a solution at European level , in a European context . #% We should ask no more of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots in relation to the Republic of Cyprus than we ask of Greece and the Greek Cypriots in relation to Northern Cyprus . #% Your pledges are under great strain , not least from the culture in European law enforcement communities , which is , at times , somewhat cavalier about data protection . #% The President of the Commission has our full support for an enterprising Europe , committed to growth and prosperity . #% We owe it to those who argue that this particular emulsifier is not necessary and desirable to ensure that the case is set out as to why it is so essential and so desirable . #% Madam President , maybe at long last we will decide that the Medical Services should not be placed in the basement . #% I look forward to another debate , as Mrs Banotti has said - perhaps in a year 's time - when we can actually start to pinpoint some of the progress that is being made . #% The power industry will undoubtedly be required to replace some old plant , hopefully by some more modern sources of power generation . #% We strongly support the 2 % increase in milk quotas for the year 2008/2009 proposed by the Commission , allowing European farmers to respond to increased market demands . #% The war on dissent continues on the part of Mr Putin . #% Their deaths and the violence inflicted on their close relatives by a squad of heavily-armed killers demonstrate the ruthless inhumanity of those responsible for organizing terrorism in Colombia today . #% Answers to my July questions only emerged in the Irish rescue , which I think is a matter of regret , not least when the smallest fund , coming from the EU budget , is used for an equal share to the larger funds . #% That is the one force trying to keep the Dayton peace process on board . #% Mr President , one of my constituents , Alexander Litvinenko , was formerly a lieutenant colonel in the Russian Federation 's FSB , the successor to the KGB . #% Mr President , it is often said that one of the first signs of madness is to start talking to yourself . #% If the glamour clubs do not participate , as is a possibility , or send out deliberately weakened teams , clearly they are not going to get the revenue for those matches which they depend on for their survival . #% That is a matter of interest and requires a focus from all of us . #% If we can do that then the spirit of cooperation will indeed be evident for all to see . #% Thus the languages that should be appearing on the national curriculum -- let me emphasise ` national ' curriculum -- should be those of the large and rapidly expanding economies of the world , which , in the case of Brazil , is an EU language : Portuguese . #% There is no smile , as we have heard , on the members of Coptic Church in Egypt persecuted for their faith . #% If people are to have secure access to food , we can not keep dumping agricultural products on their markets . #% The Council must be tough and not let the American Government off the hook . #% We can have a separate vote on it . #% It is preparing for this by placing control of the universities under the Privy Council , ready to hand universities over to the EU . #% Large businesses , even medium-sized businesses , will have offices all over Europe , they will have lawyers , they will be able to deal with consumers in that respect . #% If the EU does not suspend this agreement , it is guilty not only of an injustice to the Palestinian people but also of undermining its own laws and legislation . #% The key is to stamp it out in the world if at all possible . #% Presaging the enlarged EU , the rapporteur 's explanatory statement notes that the candidate countries could not support cultural programmes through the PHARE and TACIS programmes but that artistic cooperation has been enhanced through the THEOREM programme , by which they gained access to the Culture 2000 programme last year , as Commissioner Reding has just reminded us . #% In order to be brief I will simply say that the Committee of Independent Experts made over 90 recommendations . #% In the EU we have put together very good measures to help stamp out the disease when it comes into Europe . #% If nothing is done , then within the next 15 years rail freight will not exist . #% . Although some very good ideas were expressed , it was particularly important for the European Parliamentary Labour Party that the impact on social housing and health services was taken into account . #% The rich and the powerful stealing money from ordinary people to make their own lives more comfortable . #% Criticisms of EU aid are frequently unfair , and all the reports from Iran suggest that the EUR 2.3 million deployed by the European Union within 72 hours using the primary emergency decision were both well received and well targeted . #% To its great credit Europe has taken a lead in introducing legislation to protect the environment . #% This directive represents yet another massive shift of power from the Member States to these failing institutions . #% Mrs Read briefly covered one . #% We have had excellent collaboration in committee , and the Socialist Group will be supporting her motion for a resolution when it comes to the vote . #% Today the situation has become even more difficult , and we are witnessing a big drop in the number of young farmers coming into the industry . #% The APIs are likely to be repeating in some ways what happened in the debate about conditional access and the gateways for satellite broadcasting . #% What the previous speaker did not mention , however , was the very important fact that this embargo was strongly supported by the African Union , which is a very positive development . #% The question arises : how does this directive help address security of supply -- keeping the lights on , avoiding blackouts and outages -- and what have we in the European Parliament added to it ? #% We debated such an issue in this House only last night , that of female genital mutilation . #% in writing . - During today 's vote on the Podimata report on innovative financing , a separate amendment was voted on that called on the Commission to come forward with proposals for an EU-level financial transaction tax proposal in the absence of any initiatives at the G20 level . #% That is itself a factor in the PKK campaign . #% The process of going through it has been helpful to many . #% Mr President , I very much agree with Commissioner Nielson that 2003 was a sad year for EU-Cuba relations , and one of lost opportunities . #% This appalling incident was avoidable . #% Such a move would entitle them to claim their salaries and expenses before they are entitled to vote , and I believe , as a matter of principle , that that is wrong . #% It is very important that we encourage firms to take care to restrict the flow of inside information if at all possible , and I am very grateful to the rapporteur for responding to the concerns that I have expressed on this . #% We agree with the rapporteur , however , on the question of comitology . #% The electoral observation mission , ably led by our colleague General Morillon -- whose work I commend -- has made only a preliminary report and any political assessment this Parliament makes must similarly be guarded before drawing our own conclusions in this House . #% I thank Mr Miller for the work he has done on basically sorting out the finer details of it although , as he said , it is not really a job we should be doing . #% They will be provided by a new investor in the market , not in any way connected with any of the incumbent companies . #% Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament , outside the doors of the Hemicycle , to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate ? #% I have been in politics long enough to know that you fight and you fight . #% The British people have not been given a vote on this whole shebang of European Union , and neither has anybody else . #% A proposal to include scaffolding in an earlier amendment to the directive was rejected by Parliament , thanks to many of my colleagues on the other side of the House . #% There is no formal dialogue between us . #% First of all our forensic questioning evinced from Wim Duisenberg the clarion call of his independence . #% Furthermore , the roots of the disaster lay with the EU and its destruction of local slaughterhouses through excessive regulation . #% There are some very difficult questions to be answered as we go forward . #% But my question , Mr Fischler , is how many hundreds more black Africans need to be killed by European Union boats before you start listening ? #% What exactly is meant by the measures that have been put in place ? #% Give them an alternative to hopeless violence and a reason to rise to the challenge . #% 
I voted against these regulations at the first reading and if I thought it could succeed , I would have tabled an amendment to strike out the common position . #% Late payments can cripple companies with their cash-flow situation . #% The British Conservatives support this . #% In the end , people should come before profit but , sadly , that is not always the case . #% Thirdly , can you produce in writing your position for our meeting tomorrow so that Mr Colom i Naval can make proposals ? #% What happens if it then results in a serious incident , closing a major port ? #% This report covers nearly every aspect of policy . #% I call on Belarus to allow for the right for independent exit polls to be conducted to help verify the results , but this request is unlikely to be heeded . #% That is not bad going for a European Parliament to put five demands to the Council , get four of them in full and half of the other . #% The Wibe report is one small step for man , one giant leap for the European Parliament . #% I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Vassiliou and her cabinet with whom we have worked very closely on this , and also the Hungarian Presidency , which had early years learning as one of its priorities . #% It is the first year of the South Africa Trade Agreement . #% We have to have a bottom-up approach which involves the Iraqi people first and foremost . #% The cynic in me suggests that these statistics were swept under the carpet in order to end the ` bra wars ' , another sticking plaster when the EU needs long-term solutions . #% As it is doing in the cases of Libya and Côte d'Ivoire , the EU must continue to find creative ways within existing rules to make sure that human rights violators can never escape accountability . #% We need urgent action and we need it now . #% While recognizing many Member States have deep economic ties with China - and these are developing - we should not go down the road the Americans are going down , which is almost to ignore the question of human rights and the political dimension in favour of economic ties . #% How many false alarms will this eCall system trigger ? #% I have talked to the families of prisoners who are still in Iraq from the Iran/Iraq war of 1981-1988 . #% I was here at the first reading in the Parliament in Strasbourg . #% The one great advantage of that is that because you are there and not here the Socialists now get more speaking time since you would have had speaking time in this debate . #% Try saying that to the thousands of people , certainly in my constituency , and the millions of people across the European Union who are unemployed . #% If I did not know better , I would think perhaps there was a plot afoot here to stop the Anglo-Saxons going on doing all of their business . #% It is a very significant victory and one that I commend to the House tonight . #% The original text from Mrs Breyer , which welcomes the Commission 's suggestion that the current list be regarded , has now become ` notes the Commission 's suggestion that the current list could be regarded ' . #% Perhaps you could pop back periodically . #% In reality , our amendments on natural radiation have nothing to do with the ridiculous stories fed to the media . #% But if we are to have a real and genuine waste management strategy we must take toxics out of the waste stream . #% So please colleagues , do not be overly depressed about it , there are ways forward . #% Under the Constitution , all legislation will be subject first to the prior scrutiny of national parliaments , and then the double control of the Council and the European Parliament at European level , such that both have to approve virtually every item of European legislation . #% We are going to impose tighter Commission limits on municipal waste because we recognise that when it is burned it is as dangerous as hazardous waste . #% Mr President , unusually tonight I am not speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group , largely because I have some particularly strong views about this directive . #% Three years after this was voted in the European Parliament , an answer that you are seeking more information from experts is really not good enough . #% He and I alternate from one side to the other as rapporteur and shadow rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on these technical files . #% Secondly , in deciding the future of Objective 2 regions , will the Commission take into account that Objective 2 regions which have received support have been able to deal with the problem of industrial decline in the past but are still not yet able to show value-added production , and will therefore need to have ongoing support beyond 1999 if they are to regenerate the traditional industrial areas . #% I would hope that in these circumstances we would accept the safeguards proposed by the Commission as it is an effort worth taking and will pay off in time . #% First there is the possible postponement clause allowing accession to be delayed by one year in very extreme circumstances . #% For the record , I would like to reiterate the two statements of the Commission made at that meeting so that they are properly entered in the Minutes because I think they are important for the record . #% We must fasten rules around ourselves . #% But , as Mrs Malmström has explained , a large part of the transatlantic relationship relates to justice and security matters . #% A few years ago we had a hate-crazed bomber who specifically intended to kill gay customers of a bar . #% We support the report 's aim , in that we would like to see all countries of the EU offering support and social protection to self-employed workers . #% Fourthly and more importantly , we were very concerned about the reform agenda within the Commission and that is why I draw the attention of Members across all the parties to the amendments to the Färm Report , especially in relation to Commission reform . #% The successful and popular Central London charging scheme is an example of this new approach and represents the most ambitious urban road pricing scheme in Europe . #% This does not mean that environmental schemes will suffer from the withdrawal of LIFE money , but that money may be better spent and more transparently supervised . #% This boosts market confidence in its decisions and is a great example of open government . #% A system which arbitrarily reduces contributions on the first 32 hours of work and then increases them for later hours does not seem to me to be in accordance with that new principle of transparency which we are trying to secure . #% The possible deleterious effect of genetically modified plants is grudgingly admitted , but dismissed as insignificant - you could have bet on that being here , too . #% There was also a failure to secure the Jordanian and Syrian borders against jihadi extremists flocking in to have a bash at the allies , not to mention that Saddam opened his jails before his fall , which added organised crime to this lethal cocktail , and always with the fingers of Iran meddling on the side of the Shias in what has now become virtually a civil war . #% Therefore it is a very serious problem . #% I would have liked to have seen the Commission proposals go further . #% I want to ensure that any outbreak or suspected outbreak is contained , notably by stopping the movements of poultry and other birds . #% I would also like to thank the rapporteurs who have conducted the work on behalf of Parliament in an excellent fashion . #% The effect of this amendment will be to try to limit to one year the reference period available for the annualisation of the calculation of working time , in other words making sure that annualisation of working time is possible but no more . #% Thirdly , we want the Commission and Member States to improve the collection and availability of statistics on wage levels so that progress - or the lack of it - is made more transparent . #% So we have got to have a properly balanced scheme , with legal migration that respects individuals and respects their position , supporting both third countries and the EU . #% We have a battle going on at present between two institutions as to what Parliament 's rights are and what they are not . #% I am confident that this directive represents a major change of direction and of public habits for many European countries . #% One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect . #% Somehow we must end this transfer of valuable protein . #% I have tabled a couple and one of the delights about making a maiden speech in this House is that one has the feeling that those words might actually be studied for their merits rather than simply judged on their party political background . #% In the United Kingdom , which has traditionally had a good record , we have sadly seen over the Christmas period a rise in the numbers of people drinking and driving . #% Furthermore , let me say that America is not the problem . #% I believe that if we had an election today that turnout would be even lower because of France 's refusal to lift the ban and the fact that the European Union is brought into disrepute . #% Consequently , I think it is much better that we have a really dedicated programme on the next occasion so as to take full advantage of that evaluation and the further details in the final evaluation . #% I should like to ask if you would consider writing a letter to Mr Kaunda , expressing the support of this Parliament , and also to the Zambian authorities voicing similar concerns to other governments ? #% 
But Member States determine the practices , and we have to try to encourage adoption of the best practices amongst them . #% The area of agriculture remains largely untouched and much more work needs to be done on greening the Structural Funds and other areas of the Commission 's activity . #% In an ideal world , it should go further , with the principle of less than full reciprocity to all NAMA negotiations , or reduced subsidies for sensitive products . #% Overall , however , this is clearly a modest measure . #% Mr President , in welcoming the 1995 EMI annual report , I wish to congratulate not only Parliament 's rapporteur , Mr Gasòliba i Böhm , but also EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy , who has recently announced his retirement in 1997 . #% We are profoundly concerned at recent developments : the arrests of MPs , whatever their backgrounds ; the treatment of political prisoners ; the way in which the government , particularly the most recent government , has been repressing certain media ; and at the way in which it is dealing with its own external policy . #% The convention may unleash a few more but I am glad to see that those wretched shopping lists have gone at the first blast . #% His family has no information about his well-being beyond one video and sporadic indication from Hamas that he is still alive and well . #% The lack of an EU regulatory framework for reinsurance and differing national rules have created uncertainty for companies , barriers to trade within the internal market , greater administrative burdens and costs , and a weakening of the EU 's position in international trade negotiations . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I wish to protest at the address made by Prime Minister Siniora of Lebanon to the Conference of Presidents yesterday . #% That has not always been the case in the past , and this report should assist in achieving that end . #% As we are all aware , the Commission will be bringing forward proposals to finance that from this year 's budget , taking EUR 60 million from the general budget and EUR 60 million from the EDF . #% Today , we need to know many things . #% The proviso , of course , is that routine statutory maintenance should have been fully carried out . #% On the one hand , we are talking about a report - a report that was not a report , merely an advice - voted by one committee . #% In 1896 , William Jennings Bryan , in a great speech about bimetallism , said , ` You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold ' . #% But we now have a reasonably balanced report which we will be pleased to support in the vote in plenary tomorrow . #% The activities of organisations such as the European Youth Orchestra , ` Swinging Europe ' , the European Forum for the Arts and Heritage -- I could carry on -- all help people to understand not just culture but also the cultural dimension of Europe and , through that , the European Union itself . #% It was our committee 's view that we could reduce the number of such disagreements with the Council in future by reducing the number of individual national initiatives in this area and looking instead for Commission proposals which go through an initial vetting procedure . #% Eighteen years -- half your life -- in prison , with some of that time on death row , is punishment enough . #% When I say it has to be sorted out , I mean we have to find a real solution with the Council , not going into a conciliation or trialogues and playing the usual games . #% Will he build on that success with the elected Iraqi Government and parliamentary assembly to continue to foster the growth of democracy in the Arabian Peninsula , the Persian Gulf and the Euro-Mediterranean region ? #% The chairman of the committee has written to you as a matter of urgency , but has not yet even had the courtesy of a reply . #% The costs will be significant after the notes and coins are introduced , not before . #% The launch of the euro itself is a truly historic moment in the life of an extraordinary undertaking . #% In the same way , the right to offer new opportunities to replace those ended in coal and steel still remains a need of the Community . #% That is the context in which we are discussing this report . #% He is going to be in charge of the anti-fraud drive ! #% The Severn scheme alone could supply nearly 10 % of Britain 's energy needs . #% It is in our view absurd that so many criticisms have been made of candidate countries ; they have been reprimanded in a condescending manner when the divisions that have opened up within the European Union in the current crisis are almost entirely of the making of the existing Member States . #% We also question whether 1.27 % of the Community GDP , as was decided on in Agenda 2000 , is enough with regard to the new Cohesion Fund . #% We still do not know the final death toll of variant CJD . #% All those things we still need to thrash out . #% I have nothing but full confidence in that programme . #% However , recognition is due to the Commission officials who regularly brief our committee for the work we are undertaking . #% Portuguese bond yields hit 7.6 % on Monday . #% First , there are various articles , notably 11 ( 2 ) , where we believe that the original Commission proposals provide greater security against over-fishing than do the amendments in the report . #% As long-standing opponents of ESDP , the British Conservatives oppose proposals that extend the Commission 's hand into the defence arena . #% I should like to appeal to the Right to accept that a reasonable outcome would consist in taking some of their points , but not all of them . #% It must not be hushed up , covered up , slowed down to please the US or anyone . #% The resolution clearly points out that much remains to be done in Romania for political criteria to be adhered to in full . #% But , above all , when we see evidence that world trade rules are destroying poor people ' s livelihoods or damaging the environment we need to change the rules . #% These issues are best dealt with at the level of the UN and WHO . #% The ban on a range of identified phthalates was precautionary . #% Scientific research can mean real progress against chronic conditions unreachable by traditional scientific approaches . #% We should all reflect on that . #% This week my party marks the 25th anniversary of the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , whose government I was privileged to join . #% Although the ` double deal ' of the opt-out is potentially on the table , and taking into account the issue of on-call time , given that it is clearly impossible to do the double deal , is it not at least still sensible for you and/or the Austrian Presidency to try and clear up the issue of on-call time in isolation ? #% All this is being done in the name of efficiency . #% Such a one-size-fits-all policy would be bizarre in countries such as the Baltic States where the battery market is not even half of 160 grams . #% I ask that this should be looked into as well , because if we do not protect people from health emergencies and from the dramatic increase in health threats , the public will not thank us . #% And now we face the fourth bail-out - the second Greek bail-out - unless , of course , today you are going to tell us that is not necessary either . #% I suspect that if that had been in force before this health claims proposal came up , this one might have fallen at the first hurdle . #% We need to concentrate on all those ranges of disease where there is public concern , whether it is heart or respiratory , rheumatological or brain disease . #% I can only hope and pray that the euro project is destroyed by the markets before that really happens . #% So , for any practical observation , we need to consider just what kind of businesses we are looking at for risk capital . #% Countries can , will and should be named and shamed , but in this House and together with the Council and the UN Commission , we must redouble our efforts to ensure that men , women and children are born equal and can live as equals , enjoying the fundamental freedoms of human rights . #% I agree with Commissioner Patten that the future Palestinian State must be territorially contiguous and viable and not peppered by Israeli settlements , whilst clearly the right of return needs delicate handling . #% I happen to be the permanent rapporteur for Montenegro , which is a good news story in terms of progress towards membership , and it has just applied fairly recently . #% Indeed , it did not work at the last Strasbourg part-session either , despite the efforts of the services here . #% That is why it is right to take the time to have this period of reflection and to prolong it and look at what is possible . #% The role of Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner can never be easy , especially when it involves dealing with such difficult United Kingdom MEPs as Mr Hughes and myself . #% However , instead of doing this fairly and across the board , it has vindictively decided to target denominational and single-sex schools . #% Now , one prerequisite for a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy is to have a flexible work force . #% They must be able to go anywhere because palaces the size that he has , and he has quite a few , have the capacity to conceal major weapon sites . #% We have taught local people how to defuse the six million personnel mines in the ground . #% 
However , tonight we should recognise that this report -- however difficult it has been -- is just one piece in a very complex jigsaw in terms of countering drug trafficking and how we deal with those responsible in the future . #% Again , because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward , we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community . #% Suggestions that it should go into a landfill are a serious mistake and a very bad error and I am very glad that Ms McKenna , speaking on behalf of the Green Group earlier tonight , agreed with me about that . #% I saw that insofar as the South African negotiations were concerned . #% It is first pillar - for those who understand Union jargon - and is driven by the Commission . #% To set the recovery targets based on a percentage is a much more sensible approach . #% So far , I do not think there is any evidence of negligence or criminal activity , but I would characterise their behaviour so far as benign complacency . #% However , at the last minute , this was blocked as the social partners promised they would try , at long last , to reach an agreement , much to our frustration . #% As we are all too aware , we live in a dangerous world . #% After all , this is only consistent with the findings of the research on low-floor buses which was published by the Commission itself as long ago as 1995 . #% They perform an important social function and my British Conservative colleagues and I steadfastly defend those zero rates and will continue to defend them . #% There are great merits in opting for user-owned systems . #% Finally , this Conference is about analysing what we can do that is deliverable for the least developed countries when millions of people are unable to treat pneumonia , diarrhoea , TB or AIDS ; when you have no medicines to give to your sick child or your dying wife ; when your child is at school under a tree trying to learn to write its name with a twig . #% I have asked in my committee , but with no reply , what problems for our citizens this directive is intended to solve . #% If this is validated by the European Council , it is a strategy which , in my view , is the worst imaginable in the situation we currently face . #% Most of these teachers are of an age at which it would be extremely difficult to find suitable employment . #% It does not make sense , and if we carry on down this road , I am afraid there is going to be bad blood and bad feeling in many towns and cities across the UK . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the proposal to exempt micro-entities ( small firms ) from EU law on accounting standards . #% I would like Member States to be more ambitious . #% The lives of all our citizens , especially our young people , are too precious to take for granted . #% This Tunnel is an asset and enterprise which is jointly owned and benefits both France and Britain , as well as the wider Community of Member States . #% I believe it is sensible and good that the European Court of Justice has struck down some of the restrictions , but I think those guidelines will be important . #% That is a guarantee to us and it will concentrate the minds of the Commission in between times , making it aware that it must exercise these implementing powers in a way that Parliament finds satisfactory if it wishes to have any hope of their renewal . #% Decisions can be made between both sides of industry : trade unions and employers will get together and decide what they want to do on the Working Time Directive . #% The concerns that we have in this motion for a resolution need to be tabled . #% That leaves the residue of unsuspecting businesses that may get involved in a transaction outside their Member State . #% Perhaps it is not , but as a gesture of solidarity , please believe me that it is well and truly appreciated , and on behalf of the people of that region , I want to express my thanks : firstly to the members of the Budget Committee , who were unanimous in their support of this aid package - which is truly a gesture of solidarity . #% We also welcome the willingness to consider using the Temporary Protection Directive . #% Without reform of the CAP we simply weaken our position in the WTO at the next round of negotiations . #% Governments must make concerted efforts to help create peace in the troubled parts of the world , however difficult , and to increase aid to developing countries - strong measures that in time will work towards countering the pressures that force people to migrate . #% Does he have a view as to whether serial complaints are fundamentally undermining the EU 's commitments to the World Trade Organisation , given that they can be seen to represent trade harassment of importing countries ? #% We are not talking here of a practice of which no-one knew the dangers before . #% We have seen the United Kingdom derogate from Articles of the European Convention on Human Rights in order to legitimise the internment in Belmarsh of UK residents . #% I am concerned too about the plight of people who are arrested and held in custody in Member States of which they are not citizens , pending trial , and who are often held for extraordinarily long periods because of purely technical problems relating to translation of documents or differences between the judicial procedures of individual Member States . #% Channel 4 , which has been the best possible way of serving new interests with a public service remit in a public trust without private shareholders , is now being told by elements within our government that it must privatize . #% But what they wanted was essentially the money that was promised to them ten years ago , which was supposed to pay for the implementation of the Rio agreements agreed then . #% Stringent action must be taken against them if the Commission finds , through scientific evidence , that France is breaking any of the rules and that the food is not fit for human consumption , in the same way as it did on BSE . #% According to reports available to the Commission , the invasions have not gained any general support amongst the population of Dagestan . #% We must scrutinise the path forward very closely . #% Needle exchange does work . #% That is inherently racist and we should oppose it . #% Secondly , would you accept with respect to consumer consultation that you need to be looking at the duty not to trade unfairly and the accumulation of case history in that field , as well as setting out the duty to trade fairly , which in your country and mine , and some others , is a fairly new concept . #% It is a paradox that young people in Africa and Asia gaze longingly at the American way of life while damning the United States as the ` great Satan ' . #% Therefore , we have introduced a number of recitals that seek to focus upon key areas of implementation . #% It is a useful piece of legislation and again I would like to say ` well done ' to the rapporteur . #% I asked you , Commissioner , what you were going to do in terms of direct discussions on the issue of the formation of armed groups to combat the paramilitaries . #% No wonder they have no faith in the North , which has not produced that money yet . #% They are on the streets and there is violence , and frankly this can only get worse . #% Mr President , notwithstanding the Commissioner 's comments earlier today about her eyesight , I have decided to move forward in this rather vast auditorium so that I can at least see her for this evening 's debate . #% author . - Mr President , the EU 2020 strategy proposes action to enhance the performance of education systems , reinforce the attractiveness of Europe 's higher education , open up more mobility and training programmes for young people , modernise labour markets , boost labour mobility and develop skills and competences to increase labour market participation . #% Mr President , I respect your tenureship of the chair and I yield to no one in that , but I wonder how you can justify the fact that you indicate a time and then in the case of several speakers absolutely ignore it . #% in writing . - This own-initiative report sets the framework for the discussion of MiFID , to which the OTC Directive , the rise of ESMA and , of course , EMIR are related . #% We , as a European Union , already help Bangladesh with grants , with least-developed country status , and with the preferential access to markets that this brings with it . #% Of course , we see a stronger Europe as a condition for the very survival of Nato . #% Both protected their young , growing industries until they were capable of entering the global market . #% We have had our arguments - indeed , we have had some today - but not about this . #% Three of them seemed to have more to do with getting British Conservatives onto the list , which is going ahead at present , than with budgetary rigour or budgetary sense . #% On the other hand , the Council reflects the primacy of the nation-states , in theory at least , and should have the final say on whether a legislative instrument should have legal force . #% Mr President , at the heart of this debate is the theme of protecting the public interest in contracts awarded by public authorities . #% We are pleased that we can concur with the rapporteur on his statements on the need to uphold human rights and civil liberties . #% The rapporteur is trying to safeguard Dutch national provisions on re-usable packaging . #% There are ten cases where the Council has deleted points from the Commission 's guidelines , which Parliament was already unhappy with . #% The debt problem and the need to safeguard the environment are other issues which must not be overlooked or forgotten . #% But there were not sufficient trained officials on the ground by 1 July to enable them to come into the system . #% For 20 years , British trade unions , having being seduced by Jacques Delors , thought the European Union was in their interests . #% In addition , to the Central and Eastern European countries we have long said that if they threw off the yoke of dictatorship we would welcome them into our family . #% 
Honduras and Nicaragua will never be able to repay the interest on what they owe and postponing their liabilities is not enough . #% I may even think it is worth us staying as a Member State . #% in writing . - I realise that the Costa report deals with technical aspects of air services between the Union and Israel . #% Raising wages to levels comparable with the industrialised world is very difficult for developing countries , but funding must be targeted at the health system and efforts must be made to decentralise healthcare and to support regional development . #% I do not believe that I live in a Christian state or Christian territory and I look forward very much to Turkey joining the European Union . #% We need to be brutally honest : no taboos , as the Commissioner said . #% So this time we must insist on these provisions and insist on these matters being secured . #% But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets . #% I am greatly concerned -- as I am sure others are -- about the message that this sends out to acceding states on the eve of enlargement concerning the way we conduct our business and the way we expect Member States to adhere to Community law . #% Yet , the Members of the European Parliament present did note the late publication of the voter rolls , the failure in many , if not most , cases for the candidate details to be posted outside the polling stations and the apparent sharp inequalities between the financial means available to different candidates and parties , together with legitimate questions as to how their money was raised . #% Most members felt that publication might intensify the public pressures on governing council members to vote in line with their national interest . #% The second point is that sometimes process failures interfere with product outcomes . #% Mr President , as the geopolitical centre of gravity shifts to Asia in the 21st century , if you look at India you see the future . #% We were further disillusioned to learn of the threat of imprisonment of Lim Guan Eng , whose father we met in his role as opposition leader , for the simple reason of his articulating public concern over the treatment of a celebrated rape case victim . #% As the rapporteur suggested , with reference to the Pan-African Parliament , there is often a lack of institutional capacity . #% My other concern about the Rocard report , which is indeed well argued and full of interesting suggestions , is the suggestion in Recital M which concerns productivity in public services . #% We must also have in place a system for the investigation by an independent police complaints body of any complaints that there may be from citizens of Member States about the activities of Europol . #% I suspect that , whatever one 's views on the outcome of the French and Dutch referenda , few would disagree with that observation . #% So why , when this House voted to debate this question yesterday , did the Christian Democrats vote against ? #% There can be no doubt that , when history is written , the greatest achievement of the 20th century will be seen to be the creation of the EU . #% When did they past publish any of the good news that comes from that committee ? #% In this instance , Parliament , at my instigation , asked outside experts to draw up an impact assessment , but this was itself limited in its scope . #% Madam President , I should like to thank Fernand Herman for his excellent report and the other rapporteurs for their reports . #% The industry is in a state of constant change brought about by the development of global competition . #% Conservatives in the UK have voted in favour . #% Secondly , we need a fresh initiative , particularly in the light of enhanced police cooperation in the Amsterdam Treaty , to stop the illegal sale of arms . #% We need to anticipate the technologies that will be needed in a world where the capacity of the whole distribution system for electronic communications is going to be far larger than it is today . #% It is equally true , however , that certain sections of this House , and local employers ' organisations outside it , are increasingly calling for ever more stringent , narrowly-drawn business impact assessments as a way of blocking the Commission 's right of initiative on much-needed proposals . #% Official documents . #% We in the European Union can draw lessons from the United States . #% This was felt to uphold the freedom of contract of the parties but addition there is another element to which I will now turn . #% We must devote time and energy and some resources to getting right the opportunities that are coming through the European courts for patient mobility . #% This has been a difficult report which arouses strong emotions and we do not have a European consensus on the issue . #% He wants to analyse PNR records in conjunction with current intelligence , to identify high-risk travellers who are ` unnamed threats ' , and to share the information routinely with other homeland security sections , such as immigration , as well as the FBI and , indeed , ` our allies in London ' . #% The epidemic had a catastrophic effect on people 's lives right across the European Union , not just those in the agricultural business , but many people in the whole of the rural community . #% They traumatised whole communities . #% So I entirely support the conclusions of Carlos Coelho that we need to bring all this together , to have a consolidation of the procedures by which this evaluation is done , to consolidate the task between the first and the third pillar - and I hope that soon the phrase ` third pillar ' will be consigned to history and I never have to say it again - to have one simple , effective , efficient and transparent evaluation and to ensure that the transparency includes accountability to the European Parliament . #% Let us hear them . #% The greatest illustration of this was in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa . #% Thus , under taxation , the report calls for lower rates of VAT for labour-intensive SMEs . #% Mr President , my congratulations and thanks to the rapporteur . #% The presidency has to bring Member States together to build a competitive Europe and a Europe capable of giving leadership in the world on issues such as security , climate change and world poverty , the very issues that our citizens are concerned about . #% In the case of the PNR agreement , Conservatives believe that it is the sovereign right of a country to ask for information on people entering its territory . #% Could you say whether you would narrow that interpretation in future ? #% I did not think they were adequate , but we were told they were . #% What is Israel expected to do about that almost daily assault on its innocent citizens ? #% The Finnish Presidency would very much like to adopt this proposal in Council this week . #% I thank the President-in-Office for that very encouraging reply and I am delighted that , taken together with the question from Mrs Kinnock earlier on , we have had a welcome and very positive response on this important subject this evening . #% When you read the comments in the explanatory statement , about my own Member State and others , many of them are critical . #% The German and Greek legislatures have similar arrangements . #% We have a concern about the supply of gas from Russia to Europe . #% But problems remain . #% I was not entirely happy about the provisions with regard to animals under three months old . #% Most intifadas are popular and peaceful intifadas . #% But we would wish that they would share best practice that is available and we try and make that available to them . #% I hope that he will continue to monitor individual Member States ' implementation of the directive , although it may be down to them in detail to implement it . #% I thank the Commissioner for his very detailed and informative presentation . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Party of European Socialists I should like to congratulate Mr Schwaiger on his excellent , very clear report . #% I am pleased that last month , the government adopted a very well formulated action plan aimed at responding to these priorities and demands . #% They have no new scientific evidence . #% Not for nothing have both democratic and totalitarian governments used taxpayers ' funds on sporting activities . #% Non-member countries must adhere to basic principles such as these if the EU is to work and trade with them . #% Should we be persuaded to do their work for them and should we be bullied by the continuing ability of multinational companies and the United States of America to collude so well with the WTO against our interests and the interest of our traditional suppliers ? #% Argentina is the most recent case of such a collapse . #% Is he proud of that ? #% In fact , my first ever speech in this Chamber was back in July when I commended the Finnish Presidency on giving priority to information society and its work programme . #% 
I congratulate the Commissioner on what she said tonight . #% The responsibility for failing to fulfil the mandate lies elsewhere - maybe with the very institutions that gave us the mandate in September 1999 . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I am going to start by saying that this was a speech I did not expect to be making until a few moments ago , but it is important that we celebrate International Women 's Day , and especially this one , some 100 years since this celebration was first proposed . #% In regard to the disposal of animal waste we have found that one attempt to avoid risk has faced us with another risk . #% The response by the government of the day was the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974 , a highly effective legislative model reducing the law to a few simple principles and duties , spearheaded by a new enforcement agency . #% Mr President , this is a moment of some importance for consumer protection in the European Union . #% Those terrorists were substantially funded by US citizens . #% There are vast amounts of money laundering , enormous quantities of counterfeit goods and currency hitting us as well . #% That seems to me a very relevant consideration as to whether we should accept this oral amendment . #% This will demand a political leap in thinking with regard to Europe 's - and , in particular , the eurozone 's - economic governance . #% Just so . #% I suspect that this issue will return because I doubt whether the Council will accept them in the present form . #% The Lisbon Strategy is yet another way of damaging European economies through state interference and over-regulation . #% I hope that we could have it by early 2004 at the latest . #% Madam President , a number of speakers have referred to the coup d'etat developing in Albania . #% However , when it came to the vote , it was one of those embarrassing moments when Mr Harrison , Mr Donnelly and myself voted against when should have voted for . #% If we have a dynamic St Petersburg , then the Baltic itself will be dynamic and that even reflects on trade in the area I know best -- the north-east coast of the United Kingdom . #% When the going gets tough , the tough talkers sit on their hands . #% I would like to suggest that recorded votes during that disturbance should not count in the Bureau 's bureaucratic system . #% If the situation does not improve , do you know if there are any disciplinary procedures we could take against those Members who treat the staff in such a disrespectful manner ? #% Mr President , the ELDR Group is backing this report as one of the essential building blocks in constructing the area of freedom , security and justice and in following up the Tampere Summit , which rightly made it a priority to establish rights of free movement for legally resident third-country nationals . #% Only yesterday we voted measures to compensate for the cost of research for paediatric medicine . #% If we align the classical directive with the text of Article 55 ( 1 ) of the utilities directive , we would be bringing them into line with the emerging jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice . #% We have the curious spectacle of a communist party that no longer believes in communism applying capitalist ideas that it is not supposed to believe in . #% I have not been fighting to protect a social dimension to the Union , vital for ordinary Europeans , to allow it to be sold out via the back door by the creation of a gigantic free trade area . #% I urge the President-in-Office to do his utmost to put pressure on the Commissioner to do his duty . #% I am not too sure whether the July conciliation still serves much purpose , but the November conciliation proves its worth . #% Do you feel that the Commission ought to do some sort of publicity drive in advance of this summer holiday period to encourage people to have proper insurance ? #% Try telling that to our fishermen and farmers ! #% These things do not happen easily , they do not happen overnight but they did work extremely hard and we are now seeing the fruits of the social dialogue in that particular sector . #% Would he agree with me that women have a right to choose how they organise their lives ? #% I also welcome my fellow veterans of information technology debates . #% Your staff told me that a pair of designer boots from China cost about EUR 180 in Europe and yet only EUR 10 coming from China . #% There are varied and contrasting pictures across the 15 Member States . #% As a global trading nation , the United Kingdom handles more international freight than any other EU country and port management there is driven by free enterprise and market forces . #% There is a danger that we may try to intervene where matters of opinion are concerned . #% It is directly relevant , for once , to the lives of many people living within the European Union . #% Secondly , we must impress on the Commission the importance of ensuring that the budget delivers value for money . #% This repairs some damage that was done in the earlier versions of this report by Neena Gill . #% We welcome the intervention by Archbishop Desmond Tutu following the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Nigeria , but would call on other African leaders to equally intervene and put pressure on Mugabe to take action . #% Chinese workers themselves do not necessarily have much to gain either , facing seven-day working weeks , very low wages , appalling health and safety hazards and no trade unions . #% That will be what happens . #% We need regulation if we are to have the kind of standards which a civilised European Union wants to see . #% The failure to elect a President to succeed Mr Kovác is a clear signal that the government of Slovakia seems determined to ignore our genuine worries . #% . The British Conservatives support the concept that there may be emergencies of a major nature where the Member States will wish to express European solidarity by means of a collective contribution through the EU budget to supplement the efforts of an individual Member State or States . #% The rapporteur has wrestled , as only Dagmar Roth-Behrendt can , to find an alternative ; and if her alternative is to ban the marketing of any products that have been tested on animals , then that is fine ; but on its own that could bring an end to research and improvements , including improvements to the health of children and adults , if no alternative is available . #% Some of these arguments have been put with great clarity in this short debate . #% Problems with it being used for minor offences , the lack of legal representation in the issuing state , long pre-trial detention periods , the lack of bail for people who are not nationals of the issuing state , and bad detention conditions are all cited with reason . #% Has it interpreted the Cardiff Summit as meaning that Turkey is a candidate country ? #% In addition , the Commission is examining means of providing more detailed guidance to officials and to potential employers in order to reinforce understanding of the need to ensure that the objectives of allowing exchanges between the Commission and other bodies are fulfilled , whilst also ensuring that the integrity and the security of the Commission are completely safeguarded . #% That is what we should be looking at : improvement , not destruction . #% We have Mrs Fontaine , the Commission has Mr Prodi , the Council has a Member State government by rotation . #% The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has pumped over EUR 160 million into General Motors ' operations in Russia and Ukraine , and it owns a 30 % equity stake in the General Motors manufacturing plant in St Petersburg . #% Nonetheless , let no one be in doubt of our determination not to waver in the long war against terrorism , but we do not believe that the European Arrest Warrant as currently proposed will achieve the ends to which we are all striving . #% What it leaves for us is a reflection of the disregard of certain members of the outgoing Commission for the need to have a rigorous approach to high standards in public life . #% We also have to bear in mind that there are other issues that have to be addressed , such as the manner in which companies are taxed and the way that is approached . #% While some might say that no deal was better than a bad deal for developing countries , without the shield of the WTO -- as you said , Commissioner -- they will be left vulnerable to use and abuse in a unilateral scramble for trade domination . #% One reason why our measures have been ineffective so far is that they have not been rigorously enforced and their scope is too narrow . #% Let me be clear . #% Only two weeks ago in Parliament we saw huge tranches of her own report being deleted because they contained references to such a body . #% The Convention has not quite finished its work . #% Parliament 's position on enlargement deserves something far better than a report of this kind . #% Mr President , I was indeed in the Chair when Mr Gollnisch made an explanation of vote . #% I do not believe that this interference can be justified . #% We have in front of us now a broad strategy tailored to the overriding political goal of enlargement and few of us would disagree with the broad picture and , indeed , the early attempt to attach budgetary implications . #% Until recently we could not be sure that such efforts were genuinely being made . #% 
I believe it would be a right and proper endorsement if we were able to send a signal to the new Turkish Government that if it fulfils the Copenhagen criteria of democratic values deeply entrenched and implemented in law , then perhaps the date of June 2004 would be appropriate for negotiations . #% We can not compromise on environmental standards in those areas . #% The plight of the Kashmiri people has been of concern to the international community for nearly 60 years . #% However -- and here I speak personally -- I have some concerns about some of the measures . #% We were also aware of the simmering tension in the country , particularly in the north , with outbreaks of violence . #% We have just heard a very useful contribution which I am sure we will all welcome and can build on . #% But we need that reform process . #% Obviously there is a good deal of interest in this Parliament on the British position on this subject . #% This report , whose name probably causes more confusion than clarity amongst those people who have not been following , the subject is in fact a number of separate amendments updating the original regulation . #% . -- Mr President , I do not want to say very much about this report other than to echo some of the remarks that have been made by the rapporteur . #% I hope that on all sides of the House people would agree on the importance of those phrases and agree that they should not just be empty phrases but concepts of real meaning . #% But we are not just concerned about the institutional follow-up . #% Large companies can afford to employ all the experts that modern legislation requires : health and safety officers , fire officers , welfare officers - all those posts which large companies create to give employment to highly paid executives . #% I welcome the call for the EU to ratify the Kyoto Protocol , which is an essential international agreement in terms of protecting our planet . #% We have to make the rest of the internal market work better for consumers and businesses . #% Action now by the international community could help avert this situation . #% I am not sure which is worse . #% In addition , they faced physical abuses in the form of beatings from their employers or were at risk of sexual exploitation by the families employing them . #% Madam President , since a colleague has mentioned the name of Gibraltar could I remind the House that Sunday , 10 September is the national day in Gibraltar and some of us will be there . #% For example , schools in Bedford are using Thai chicken to prepare meals for the pupils . #% This is a problem for the Europol Agreement and the EU-US Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement . #% A number of United Kingdom MEPs have been contacted by farming interests , who are very worried that the incineration directive will apply to all on-farm incinerators in the United Kingdom . #% That is the first point I would make : the target is already tough . #% However , we believe that education policy is and should remain a Member State competence , and that any improvements and measures with regard to the education of children of migrants should be developed by Member States themselves . #% The majority position of my committee is that we need to simplify and clarify the procedures . #% We can increase that percentage quite significantly if we get it right and bring this proposal to a successful conclusion . #% Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many , many more decades than companies from Japan , Korea and elsewhere , that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere . #% Today I looked at a briefing from an NGO which said that it was weary of congratulating institutions . #% This is an area that is extremely badly understood by the public . #% Just as we seek to uphold the law to protect LGBT rights , so too should we seek to ensure that those who wish to express contrary , non-inflammatory views within the bounds of the law regarding free speech should be free to do so as well . #% Our European Union is not just a union of states , it is a union of citizens . #% Is the fact that you are unelected the reason why you do not command more respect on the global stage , and why increasingly , the peoples of Europe are holding you and the entire Commission in contempt ? #% There should be a clear code of conduct on the interpretation of the Pact so that it can be credible for the future . #% Mr President , before Doha , many of us were clearly aware that the issue of access to medicine was going to be the benchmark that developing countries would use to test our seriousness about whether we wanted to launch a development round . #% Europe should choose a morally decent way out of this crisis : a human way based on our fundamental values - which actually is also a smarter way in economic terms . #% We pay the producers to make the starch and then we pay them to export it because nobody wants it . #% The third reason is the intolerable attack on the liberty of Roy Bennett , one of their members of parliament , a man who has suffered , whose family has suffered and whose workers have suffered over the months . #% The requirement for Member States to notify the Commission of specific critical infrastructures is counter-productive , as it would produce a list of targets that would be of great interest to the wrong people . #% Is it to come from the two directorates ? #% I must also ask you this , Commissioner : we ask our citizens to move and live elsewhere , and we do not want to see this kind of scenario again . #% It is sad to see how little international help has been given to those refugees or to their hosts , the Iranian government . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , it gives me no pleasure to say that the ALDE Group voted the wrong way on amendment 1 , by the PPE-DE Group , to the Roure report . #% Above all , we are interested in the enlargement process and in making sure that we can fulfil our obligations and that Member States are fully integrated into the Union after 1 May 2004 . #% On the other hand when you send us the elements of the Staff Regulations , as legislators we need to make sure that those changes to the rules are going to work in favour of good administration and not against it . #% We would like , however , to insist that in future the small islands are allowed as of right to attend those appeals panels , represented by whosoever they wish , as is the norm in all other international arenas . #% I knew then , as I know now , that the requirements set down in that particular set of articles were merely mechanistic , that it comes down to political goodwill . #% I am not talking about illegal or economic immigrants , but legal migrant workers from Member States of the EU , new and old , who in my own region are predominantly Portuguese and Polish . #% In addition the Community food supply programme for Russia , that was launched earlier this year , is subject to very close monitoring which involves , amongst other things , checks on the use of the funds generated by the sale of relevant food products on local markets . #% I do hope that , since the matter is now so much more urgent , there could be a possibility of the Commission and Parliament reintroducing it as an issue that ought to be addressed urgently . #% With that small reservation , I can support the text and my group will be voting in favour of the rest of it . #% Over the last 20 years or so , it has built itself up from a government-funded organisation into a successful commercial enterprise . #% This is not specifically about the digital world . #% Member States often cite the World Health Organization as the proper body for that and of course it has a crucial role , one where greater cooperation with the Commission should be encouraged as Members here have often done . #% Mrs Paulsen wants to fine-tune the partial ban to include the non-cannibalistic reintroduction of meat and bone meal from category 3 material , that is , material which is suitable for human consumption . #% Therefore , one of the reasons for our amendments is to alleviate that problem next year by making the monies available this year . #% Parliament has only one reading on this , which is another reflection which was not corrected at the Nice Summit of the democratic deficit . #% It is very important that the Member States that have responsibility for pension schemes bear in mind the needs of citizens who use their European rights to work and retire in different countries of the Union . #% I am totally astonished by this , do not know what the reasons are and do not understand what I am supposed to have done wrong . #% in writing . - This report makes sobering reading : for all the talk about the Lisbon agenda , and making Europe the world 's most competitive economy by next year , I was shocked to read that the US public sector is spending USD 50 billion per year on research and development procurement . #% The offer is not perfect . #% Today is an historic day for Cyprus , as well as for the European Union . #% Before dwelling on the historic nature of today , I would like to acknowledge that it has only been possible to get where we are thanks to the determination of the Commission . #% The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut . #% Not everybody has to join the Union in order to meet the requirements of their foreign policies satisfactorily . #% It is simply not acceptable to treat our constituents like mushrooms , to keep them in the dark and cover them with fertiliser . #% Another interesting comparison is that the money British taxpayers are spending on their MEPs would cover the entire operating costs of the police force of a medium-sized British county . #% 
Sustainability is not just a domestic issue . #% Changes must take place in a wider framework of change and democratic openness on all sides . #% For all the value we find in Plan D , the best way to boost trust through action will be to salvage the Constitution . #% Mr President , I endorse the remarks that have just been made . #% We accept that an increasing number of EU citizens are demanding better services . #% Therefore we should do something about it now and not just talk about it . #% I would like to begin by echoing previous speakers and adding my words of thanks to the rapporteur and to our chairman and to you for the magnificent work you did in that conciliation . #% Those people yesterday caused me no particular offence in terms of the cause they were pursuing but the next time it might very well be people to whom I and other elected Members of this House would have very great objections . #% There was a good report last month ; we want to see that report by Mr Whitehead put into effect as quickly as possible . #% The proposals you put forward will help us to support European agriculture , European farmers and give good value to European taxpayers who are sometimes forgotten . #% We have no idea what our policies are going to be by 2013 . #% The Americans , in particular , seemed to draw the line and say ` we are not going to do anything except protect our agriculture and our business ' . #% We have got to get these policies of internal market industry , small and medium-sized enterprises , research and development working closely together . #% I wish to ask a supplementary question . #% If you fill up your car with the latest diesel at 10 parts per million , the downside of that is that the sulphur , which has been taken out of your diesel , remains in the bunker fuel which goes to the ships , and could be 26 000 parts per million . #% I think this is something that we should not be welcoming but should actually be very worried about . #% I am still not sure whether the Council 's figure of 1 % includes the EDF . #% This is crucial as the outcome of such procedures can literally be a matter of life or death for the applicant . #% The first point is the importance of this issue being treated on a bottom-up basis rather than a top-down basis , that it is up to Member States as close as possible to the problem to address the problem most successfully . #% The minister says that he supports the UN and is monitoring the talks , but why is he not offering the services of the Council in trying to broker a solution ? #% One concluding comment : the current severe disruption of the Asian financial markets makes it all the more imperative that EMU is launched on a solid basis . #% And will the Commissioner be replying to the debate as a whole at the end ? #% The freedom of movement on which this European Union is founded is daily denied to our continent 's 37 million disabled citizens . #% I hope , however , that by that time and by the time many of the young people in the public gallery here -- including young people from St Martin 's School in Brentwood , in my constituency -- are firmly established in their professions , the European Union itself will have moved away from its obsession with political integration , into a somewhat looser community of nation states . #% Surely now is the time for the EU to show moral courage and leadership . #% It would certainly be available to your area , just as it is to other areas in the United Kingdom . #% It is also a positive encouragement to increase fathers ' involvement in caring for children . #% Mr President , the last time we debated this , in answer to my question , the President-in-Office confirmed that agreements under Article 98 ( 2 ) are compatible with the Rome Statute and indeed are foreseen in the Rome Statute . #% It should be a day , yes , to celebrate how far women have come , but , yes , also to raise awareness about how much further we still have to travel in terms of equality . #% As stated in all the advertisements : you can not guarantee that past profit is an indication of future gain . #% We have also made substantial progress in developing a workable proposal on the issue of unfair commercial practices , where enforcement is the key . #% As is so often the case , the devil lies in the detail . #% My complaint was then , and still is now , that this was a matter best left to Member States or indeed to local authorities - a point already made most eloquently by my colleague , Mr Jensen , a few moments ago . #% This must be a very serious debate when I see the number of people who are here from the Council . #% Fifthly , we must intensify the cooperation on water supplies . #% I also want to know - and that again is in our resolution - whether we will be sending a high-level representative . #% As I made clear in my letter of 25 January to Mrs Gradin , whilst all liberties of speech are precious and must be upheld , the expression of certain opinions - for instance those that may be considered to defame others - can have legal consequences in all democratic societies , and have specific implications for the Commission as an employing European institution . #% Furthermore , Britons facing legal difficulties abroad will now have easier access to justice , including access to legal aid and translation services and simplified procedures governing compensation and debt claims . #% We have seen recently a wave of mergers and restructuring that spread throughout the financial services sector . #% We need to deliver on better security cooperation . #% We are clearly in a very serious situation . #% This matters in many ways , not least because in modern society use of , and access to , the telephone is a necessary part of life . #% The framework agreement is a distinct improvement on the one we signed with the Prodi Commission in 2000 . #% The real position of the Turkish authorities can be illustrated by the fact that last month the President had authorized that the Orthodox school on an island opposite Istanbul should be allowed to open . #% It is also , in the context of the internal market , about encouraging cross-border tendering and working : 15 % of EU GDP - that is an important input in achieving public policy aims . #% I will vote in favour of this resolution because the European Parliament needs to have its voice heard so that innocent Palestinians trapped in Gaza will not be forgotten . #% I know that is understood in this House , but I spell it out for the record in the hope that it might eventually trickle through to the understanding of the press in Member States and maybe eventually to the public , who are persuaded daily by the newspapers that there is a great centralising process going on in the European Union when in fact the opposite is the case . #% Despite enormous advances in market access including the ` Everything but Arms ' initiative by the Commission , the Least Developed Countries ' share of world trade has halved over the last 40 years from 1.9 % to 1 % . #% What we are fighting for is Parliament ' s rights , we are not fighting for money . #% When we name and shame countries , we are accused of imposing our standards . #% The offence of falsification of records must not negate or obscure the long-term case for reprocessing or MOX fuel assemblies . #% But here is a chance for it to deliver a success story for Europe before the end of this mandate . #% We must have a strong , effective monitoring operation , but it must have the support of the government , the LTTE , the United Nations and its members . #% If she is here at this point , could she clarify that she is in favour of all parts of this split vote . #% As regards the state of religious freedom in Vietnam , the Vietnamese Constitution as Mr Mann reminded us enshrines the freedom of religion as a basic freedom of the Republic . #% Knowing how long it sometimes takes for all the institutions of the Union to arrive at a decision , the thought of introducing another tier between the attempt on your life , Mr President , and the response by the policeman , and it would have to pass through several committees , I hope sends a shiver down your back . #% It is equally right that we should take note of the views of those other observers and human rights groups who thought they were not . #% If resolute action had been taken earlier , then maybe the Indonesian authorities would have responded differently . #% I hope that no groups have taken advantage of that deadline to table amendments . #% We remain confident that a balance can be found in Council on the basis of some of the recommendations made under the consultation procedure in Mr Kreissl-Dörfler 's report . #% We could have used vaccines , which were also ruled out . #% EU regulations stifle their growth and , for once , the Commission is doing something sensible with its proposal to exempt micro-enterprises from some accounting regulations . #% These are the first crucial steps in the decentralisation of financial control , which is of course critical to the empowerment of management at all levels in a money-handling institution . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , on behalf of the ALDE Group , I strongly welcome the fact that this resolution calls for a strengthened strategic partnership between the EU and the US as a cornerstone of EU external policy . #% If action is not taken , this small but locally important industry may die . #% That is why the original Commission proposal did not contain any reference at all to data retention , which was added by the Council . #% 
I would be interested to hear Commissioner Brittan 's observations on that aspect . #% Imposing duties could punish consumers by increasing the price they pay for their footwear . #% We have eventually settled on the European Parliament hearing the recommended candidate , offering a confidential opinion and receiving feedback on how that is being taken into account . #% I only regret that we did not pursue this issue more fully in the Parliament 's own debate on access to sensitive documents . #% The requirements in these two proposals : firstly , to ensure recycling of substantial quantities of waste electronic and electrical goods , and , secondly , to ensure substantial reductions in the amount of hazardous substances in these products will be technically and financially very difficult to achieve for many people . #% Targets are fine , but they can quickly undermine the credibility of the process if the targets are either not met or are simply met by Member States through a statistical sleight of hand . #% Therefore we must allow the schemes in front of us to come to a natural conclusion and allow some industrial installations to opt out and opt in , at least in the earliest phases of the new scheme . #% I am concerned that he has agreed to a period of reflection on the Constitution . #% We do not need any lectures about this , because it is quite clear that unless we maintain our own defence industries and defence infrastructure then all we will end up doing is buying American weapons and being totally dependent on the Americans for our defence . #% I look to him to lead that debate in the coming months . #% Consequently I need urgent clarification as to my rights and obligations as a Member of this House from the President . #% I agree with the call for US-style EU-wide insolvency laws along the lines of the American Chapter XI bankruptcy procedures which afford a number of advantages , particularly in so far as they do not disrupt the continuity of trading in failing companies . #% He has never produced evidence to the press , to the Committee on Budgetary Control , to the Bureau of Parliament or to our President . #% Paragraph 16 of the report seeks to extend the REACH system to cover chemicals manufactured in volumes of under one tonne per year ; this will lead to a possible twenty-fold increase in the number of chemicals requiring authorisation , and an impossible workload for those given that task . #% We were convinced that in no way , shape or form would the Council ever agree to the flexibility instrument being used for Category 5 . #% We , the developed world , are short of doctors . #% We must do everything we can to protect minorities and to give them freedom from oppression . #% Amongst my East Midlands constituents I sense a growing concern and , indeed , anger against the European project . #% In the Outcome Document there are strong commitments on how we should meet the MDGs by 2015 . #% Our problems are caused in the main in Member States , where 85 % of EU money is actually administered and 85 % of our problems occur . #% The Commissioner will say that the legal base in Article 137 will not permit this . #% in writing . - As a UKIP MEP , I am against any kind of EU interference in the UK system of asylum and in any related directive which would force EU rules on the UK . #% This is something that we have not managed to do in this proposal . #% But Member States should concentrate on structural reforms , particularly in their labour markets , as the way ahead . #% That is why I tabled this amendment and indeed voted for it . #% It has been with us for many years , and for many years we hoped and believed that an effective test ban , conditional on a phased introduction of alternative testing , was on the way . #% For many years I have worked to overcome the problem of anti-personnel landmines , but I have always sought to focus attention on the real culprits , who use such weapons indiscriminately and irresponsibly . #% Because the treaty has not come into force : indeed , it was rejected comprehensively by Irish voters last year . #% Mr President , I , like other colleagues , welcome this debate , because it makes sense to have a debate on the legislative programme before we take decisions on the 2004 budget . #% In passing , I would say that our delegation was very impressed by her and her foundation 's work in combating the AIDS epidemic in Malaysia . #% In addition , at the end of July , agreement was reached with the IMF , and other financial institutions , on the resumption of direct loan assistance , and soon afterwards there was an agreement in the Paris Club on rescheduling debt service payments due on Russia ' s sovereign debt . #% Maybe 25 to 30,000 prisoners from Iran are still inside Iraqi prisons . #% We have different commercial systems and a different tempo of life . #% Inevitably , however , if human rights violations were to increase or fail to be dealt with , it would not be possible to oppose a much tougher line in future . #% As this is particularly important before an election campaign , in which some honorary Members are deliberately using the title in order to create the impression that they are still Members of this House , I would urge you to write as soon as possible to all those who still have this title to inform them of the new rule and the new situation . #% I am very pleased that he has taken on this report , because I know the commitment we need from all sides of the House . #% Democracy and development go hand in hand . #% Indeed , we deplore violence against both sexes being perpetrated by both sexes , or by anyone against anyone . #% Following on from the question about the timetable , I should like to make a comment . #% So will the Commission stick to its guns on this issue ? #% It is this factor that we in this House have to recognize ; and we , as part of the international community - the European Union - have been asked to lend the essential support that election needs . #% Whatever the origins of the Middle East conflict , there is increasing recognition amongst Arabs that Israel is here to stay , whilst Jews around the world can see that Israel 's long-term security is best served via recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have their own State by 2005 . #% We have the present generation of fuels and biomass available , but we are also seeing new generations coming on and we will see bioplastics coming into place . #% The problems of the Mediterranean demonstrate , more dramatically than perhaps anywhere else , that foreign affairs is not just a series of unconnected and unpredictable crises . #% I hope the Commissioner can today comment on how many prosecutions there have been so far of Member States which are refusing to comply with these rules and regulation and how many are planned . #% Increased interinstitutional cooperation and increased use of the codecision procedure necessitate greater openness by the Council in particular . #% Indeed so many committees have been set up that the name comitology was invented to describe a system that was so difficult to fathom and so difficult to get to grips with . #% Constantly trying to grind people down is not a solution . #% I did so at the time and I do now . #% It may be that my motive was also concern to stop using so much electricity supplied by a company owned by a French utility , but that is another issue . #% In 1990 , Helmut Kohl and François Mitterand made a promise that we would have the enlargement of the European Union completed by the year 2000 . #% Where there are definitely no living heirs , assets stolen from these victims of the Holocaust should be used to finance material support for the many now elderly and poverty-stricken survivors who came originally from a background of poverty . #% As the House is aware , the Financial Regulation that came into force on 1 January 2003 no longer permits direct operating subsidies to be awarded to external bodies without either a call for proposals or the establishment of a legal basis for expenditure . #% However , I would argue , as you have done , for a more measured approach in the assessment that we make and would agree that we should describe it as a glass half-full . #% Parliament has accepted that a social EU does not automatically need more EU regulation . #% As a farmer myself , and someone who had a beef herd , I can testify to the wholesale damage and destruction that BSE has done - not only to the beef industry in my own country , but also in Member States throughout the Union . #% We believe that the protection of national borders for us remains a key element of public policy at national level . #% I was delighted to hear that Commissioner Verheugen is going to bring forward a comprehensive programme for modernising and enhancing the conditions for small businesses . #% I would hope that it would apply to such issues as the granting of contracts on a fair and open basis - rather than giving them to your rich friends . #% We were certainly under the impression that the dates mentioned in the preamble to the directive , as it was finally adopted , were the dates that would apply to the accession states . #% It is also a multi-ethnic , multi-religious and multi-region nation , and any Indonesian Government has our sympathy and goodwill in its efforts to hold its disparate regions , religions and cultures together . #% Romania and Bulgaria were highlighted in the UN human trafficking report last week . #% Secondly , the Ludford report has a series of amendments tabled by the Christian Democrats challenging a series of paragraphs that were originally in the Evregenis report 15 years ago - and were approved by the Christian Democrats then - on the amendment of the Staff Regulations to allow ethnic minority members to join the European Community staff . #% We are very glad to hear of the outcome of the trialogue and the Commission 's statement today promising proposals for the revision of Regulation No 1408/71 . #% My political group has a major problem with this . #% On the other hand , consumers need to know that they are paying more for a genuine organic product . #% 
That of external trade , where I believe the European Union should uphold progress towards a liberalised world-trade order ; that of industry , European industry , where jobs and industries are at threat from sanctions and they are innocent victims of these sanctions ; and I speak from the perspective of a UK Member of this House who is tired of receiving letters of complaint from companies whose business and whose workers ' jobs are at threat from the sanctions through no fault of their own . #% Such illegal smuggling of cigarettes from outside the European Union is now causing a great deal of concern and may lead to an increase in smoking , certainly in my constituency and much of the United Kingdom . #% Yet this is not a vote against free movement of EU citizens . #% Sadly , even since unification , Yemen has been the victim of the civil war of April to June 1994 . #% Syria remains a one-party state although there is talk of ending this state of affairs . #% If the EU delays enlargement too long , it may make it more difficult , or impossible , for some candidate countries to join within the envisaged timetable . #% It seems that high officials get off and ex-parliamentarians , who are in the Commission services get downgraded for no apparent reason and against the information available . #% These include humanitarian and development aid , mine action , election monitoring , financial and practical assistance to strengthen the judiciary and the rule of law and the civil administration , and well-targeted economic sanctions where appropriate . #% In fact , the relationship is so important that a three-year UK inquiry into alleged bribes paid to Saudi ministers by an arms contractor was killed by orders of Prime Minister Tony Blair on the grounds of national security . #% Mr President , I should just like to say that after this vote I hope everyone is convinced of the need to reform our Rules of Procedure . #% I am particularly critical of paragraph 29 , even as amended , which considers the separation of church and state to be the most acceptable form of government . #% This resolution signals the desire of this Parliament to step up the pressure on the Indonesian authorities and we hope very much that the Council and the Commission will respond to our appeal . #% Currently it is possible to opt-out of the 48-hour week by way of either an individual , or a group , signing an agreement with the employer . #% Now we see change . #% That is the point : if we do not get this right , we bring the whole of European law and the whole of our institutions into disrepute . #% I shall detain the House no longer . #% I say ` would ' because the Fernandes report is to be adopted without a vote . #% The apparent anomalies have not helped either in social security coordination and entitlements , even different definitions as to what constitutes self-employment . #% I believe we have rightly criticised the Commission for taking a laid-back and complacent view on this . #% To me their future security and the security of their children hinges upon reaching a suitable settlement so that we can expand the European Union to those Central and European states . #% There is no appetite for endless debate on Constitutional , institutional structures . #% We need answers to these questions before we open the floodgates . #% They state in the final paragraph that ' a complete ban on long hours would be unfeasible in many companies and industries or would be simply disregarded . ' #% There are three points that I want to make . #% But it specifies that this Annual Legislative Programme must refer to all proposals of a legislative nature and every act included in the programme must indicate the legal basis and the timetable envisaged for its adoption . #% In this particular area , at a time of great terrorist threat -- and there were terrorist threats in 1999 as well -- there is a very uncertain message being sent out that the Presidency and the Commission and , regrettably , too many of those sitting in this House then and now seem to think that the most pressing need is to bring in the under Article 42 . #% I want to approach this from a very different perspective . #% People across the world opened their hearts and opened their purses , shaming governments into matching the monies their peoples had given . #% I hope this behaviour will act as a warning and not a precedent when we handle future dossiers in this field under co-decision : the reward we were offered by Council for being a `` politically mature '' institution , capable of agreeing with Council . #% Gaza has been bombed to bits and Israel is not allowing it to be rebuilt . #% A number of factual inaccuracies have therefore crept in . #% The Commission should generally adopt the guiding principle that it should at least be capable of putting forward some evidence in favour of its proposals , rather than merely going for something which appears to be no better than the average practice in those Member States where the prudent person principle is adopted . #% I will be interested to hear what the Council and the Commission have to say about how they intend to approach the ASEM Summit from these points of view . #% Thus the Dublin Convention is , in the words of the UK House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities , a shaky edifice on which to construct a system for taking and exchanging fingerprint data on those who have not yet made or may not make an asylum application . #% Members should bear this in mind when those records are published and it appears that the record of attendance does not correspond to the reality of the situation . #% I hope that the rapporteur will consider withdrawing them and that the Commission and the Council will reject them . #% The rules in Regulation 1408 must provide a balance between encouragement of labour mobility and avoidance of abuse . #% We want the quality of data to be improved , for it to be timely , and we want to be able to examine upstream input to national accounts , and we ask : is the new power given to Eurostat sufficient ? #% I am grateful to the Commissioner for coming here and naming by implication those Member States which have failed so far to meet the deadline for the submission of these plans . #% I am surprised that a committee like the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy seems to be unaware of this fact . #% Mr President , both these reports before us today recognise the increasing mobility of persons and the rise in contractual and commercial transactions across our Union . #% Incineration is often the most effective and safe method of waste disposal . #% Maybe now we are discussing something which is not so much a Columbus egg as a Columbus omelette . #% I should just like to come to the question of certification , which was in my original question . #% Madam President , apparently the Committee of the Wise Men may be presenting their report to the President and the group leaders sometime today . #% However , we are firmly opposed to any idea of developing a ` European Police Force ' , we believe that the European contribution to military rapid reaction forces should be conducted through NATO , and that ` operational capacity ' that relates to either of these aspects is a matter for individual nations and not a matter for the EU . #% This is shortchanging not only the teachers themselves but also their students who can not possibly be taught properly in the much larger classes and the reduced time available . #% Under the chairmanship of Mrs Flautre the subcommittee has gone from strength to strength and , coupled with the appointment of Mr Michael Matheson , we have made inroads into the implementation of human rights guidelines . #% Yesterday mention was made of a document which was quoted partially in the press about the ongoing affair of the chief accountant who has been suspended . #% That new direction is cooperation . #% This should not , however , lead to closures of existing power plants where there are no safety concerns or prevent the opening of new nuclear installations to replace out-of-date plants . #% And when that assessment is complete , we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us . #% This is happening at a time when the US is anxious to mend fences with the EU and needs our help . #% Across our continent there are many different cultures , different languages , different religions and different ways of living . #% On my examination of the information there are no safety reasons why the commissioning of Number 1 reactor should not proceed . #% The Pact itself recognises that it will not always be possible to remedy excessive deficits immediately if there are special circumstances . #% We have also generally sought to have the Commission , advised by the Securities Committee , take account of different securities and issuers including small business . #% However , it is up to the Member States to set and levy charges , albeit in a common framework . #% To have a reliable system of occurrences reporting in civil aviation , we have to ensure confidentiality for the people who report them . #% Given the proximity both in place and time to our current part-session , what information does the President have on their hostile intentions towards Parliament ? #% Rule 37 makes it quite clear that the Commission may , at any time , ask for permission to make a statement . #% Human rights abuses can never be just an internal matter for a country . #% It can also be no coincidence that the Labour Government ' s decision was criticised at the time by the boom-and-bust Tories , who have an outstanding record on economic instability and incompetence . #% In the light of this deteriorating situation , it is high time to tighten up targeted sanctions against the regime . #% There must not be any possibility of what is effectively our taxpayers ' money going into the wrong hands or being wasted . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , I will not read from my notes . #% 
Mrs Sandbæk has written to you , Commissioner , asking to see a copy of the signature of your former , former chief accountant on the 2001 accounts . #% It has not happened yet , but our resolution must be to ` prepare , prepare , prepare ' ! #% I would ask the presidency to send an appropriate note of condolences to the people of Israel and particularly the families involved . #% The no-shows and the late cancellations suffered by hotels and airlines should also be taken into account in considering this matter . #% He then got in contact both with the Department of Health and Social Security in Britain , and with myself , and I and my staff also got in touch with the Department of Health and Social Security , which suggested that I should raise it with you to try and ensure that this sort of thing does not happen , and that medical staff in all our Member States are reminded of their duty to advise people who are ill who come to them to go to the office to obtain reimbursement . #% Mr President , Moldova is a small landlocked country , the poorest in Europe , whose importance to the EU will rise as our frontiers will border it by 2007 . #% There has been much discussion about this , but I am firmly of the opinion that Article 95 , the single market , is the correct legal base . #% That is the day that commemorates the 60 000 workers per year who die globally from job-related injuries or illnesses and the many millions more who are injured . #% The WTO process needs to be made far more democratic and transparent . #% Lo and behold , as a result of this , we now have a comprehensive report which I was just discussing with my colleagues - including Commissioner Kinnock this morning - observing that progress has indeed been made . #% Were I in that situation on the present occasion , I could not in all honesty take the congratulatory line , for I believe the report to have some obvious shortcomings . #% Mr President , I thank Mr Maat for the skilful and sensitive way in which he has handled a complex dossier . #% I thank the Commissioner for that very clear answer . #% I welcome this change because he has said that he will eat British beef and that the ban was imposed specifically for economic and political reasons . #% Low-paid workers are often forced to work long hours at very low wages without any enhanced supplement for working on a Sunday . #% Mr President , regarding the matter of televising Friday morning sittings , can you tell me whether they will be televised from now on ? #% Mr President , let me join in with Members across the House in expressing deep regret for the deaths on all sides in recent attacks in the Middle East . #% That is our boy , he is the man that is going to stand up for British interests . #% Yes , these have been a long time coming -- too long perhaps -- but they are there now . #% We thank the Rapporteur for his condolences in respect of the London bombings . #% The risk is that with this particular regulation we are simply playing at the edges . #% Please do not try to mend this system . #% I urge you to back the ELDR Group amendment and reject this ill-thought-through attempt to introduce media regulation by the back door . #% It is not the end , but it is a good beginning and much credit goes to both the Commission and our rapporteur . #% We do not support quotas or interference in the ways in which trades unions , for example , select their officers . #% We have made it easier for recalcitrant countries to be named and shamed into improving their performance . #% They are after all more subtle and sophisticated . #% My Amendment 1 spelled this out specifically and was readily embraced by colleagues within the EPP-ED Group . #% We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the President this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday . #% I welcome any moves that will strengthen the efforts already made in the UK and by the Commission to stamp out BSE . #% Mr President , with your permission , indeed at the suggestion of the House , I would like to make a Commission statement on Kosovo . #% Mr President , the Greens have spent more than a decade endeavouring to expose the myths at the heart of the free-trade theory . #% How fitting that it should be our committee , with its new competence in this legislature bridging the themes of legal affairs in the internal market , that should have had to deal with this new Brussels regulation . #% They mortgaged their homes on the basis of false promises . #% All we need is the Council to work as constructively with us . #% We therefore welcome paragraph 6 but we have reservations about the rest of the report , in particular paragraph 4 , because we can not agree that the ` golden rule ' is a good example for Europe to follow . #% We are seeking to promote and encourage adaptability . #% It is vital that seafarers receive the necessary high level of training and certification in order to reach the level of competence and skill needed during their service at sea , to be able to communicate effectively with the crew , follow instructions and advice and , on occasion - all too often I fear - deal with crisis situations . #% Now it is up to all of us to take responsibility for ensuring its future success on behalf of those patients who suffer . #% Nice to see that you can do some work , or at least others can do it on your behalf . #% We have massive amounts of asbestos hidden in our workplaces , homes , schools and hospitals . #% What a brilliant strategy the Americans must have ! #% Second , the extent to which outlying regions and islands depend on the sea for contacts with their neighbours . #% Mr President , I regret having to rise on what might seem a trivial point of order but I feel it fair to let Members of the House know that about 20 minutes ago Mrs Hardstaff and I found two photographers , armed with long-range lenses , taking photographs of somebody 's office from the extension of the building . #% I would ask you if you could look into the procedure by which the questions are put into the order they are on the order paper . #% Enlargement is challenge of the decade . #% As the Commissioner was kind enough to say , the Commission has taken notice of a number of reports we have made . #% The responsibility of security often conflicts with the additional mandate of the UN to protect human rights , as many of the UN Member States are undemocratic dictatorships -- resulting in the perverse decision to appoint Libya as Chair of its Human Rights Committee . #% This report also comes highly recommended for its close attention to the all of the component parts of local economies : the promotion of female entrepreneurship , for example , is relatively innovative and could pave the way for new kinds of innovation and economic growth . #% The Council , and only the Council , can give us the background to what happened last night in the Agriculture Council . #% Clearly reparations were not the right means of redress to talk about . #% Given its future military application and China 's inclusion in the project I voted against the report . #% They should think of the trees ! #% Quite rightly he is stressing the amount of effort the Commission , and in particular his directorate , are putting into ensuring that directives and regulations agreed by Member States are transposed by those Member States . #% This is why we back UN reform that will secure greater efficiency and also inject new vision . #% We have to bear in mind what the Interinstitutional Agreement says about a rule not being used for the same things in consecutive years . #% I am confident we will get a strong majority for this tomorrow and it is absolutely right that we should . #% Finally I ask the Commission and the Council to take note that we welcome the principle of labelling beef by country of origin and that we call on the French presidency to set an example by making an immediate commitment to accept all beef so labelled from all EU countries and let the consumer decide . #% It is the first time that Article 138b of the EC Treaty has been used as a call for legislation . #% Before I start , I wish to add to what the Commissioner said about the Food Safety Authority , which is of fundamental importance . #% Previous speakers have been right about the climate in which this debate has taken place . #% Can I repeat a question that I put to the Commission on 23 November : on how many occasions has the Commission called in the police on matters of internal fraud in its 41 year history ? #% Humanitarian aid undoubtedly helps , but just as obviously it is simply not enough . #% I await with interest the result of the field trials currently being carried out in my own country , to see whether they provide any evidence on the effects of biodiversity . #% There are very few regulations which are concerned with what the Internet is used for . #% We are now , just a matter of months later , apparently to embark on another . #% 
It would also be impractical for aviation to join the general ETS before 2012 . #% There are also general concerns expressed in AJK over a number of issues , including women 's rights and religious minority rights . #% Given that Germany and Denmark , together with Poland , have already prohibited force-feeding , will the Commission now come forward and propose an outright ban on so as to harmonise EU legislation in this area ? #% Madam President , Truro is in Cornwall , not in Devon . #% As a consensus could not be reached on the person to draft it , it decided that the Chairman of the committee should also be the rapporteur and I was left with the wonderful task of putting this report together . #% The Green Paper also focuses almost exclusively on products rather than services and therefore misses another whole raft of potential opportunities to green an increasingly large area of our economies . #% Mr President , resolution 1441 is very clear . #% He has only replied to Question No 1 . #% The time has come to invest in programmes that target more effectively the health needs of the people in Africa . #% Those are fine words , but where are the resources and where is the debt relief ? #% That has to be a key building block of our new approach . #% Re-distribution must ensure fairness . #% Mr President , I would like to continue this internal PPE-DE debate by focussing solely on the Laeken Declaration . #% Yes , we should be encouraging the development of renewable non-food crops , though not tobacco , particularly on voluntary set-aside land . #% Whilst I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for his efforts , I share with him his disappointment at our failure to make much progress on our amendments . #% However , the issue of land animals in Africa highlights the complexities involved in securing solutions . #% One of the main concerns of that convention is the right for children to live in peace . #% Consumers demand high quality , and that is what they will buy . #% Are we ready to pay for those resources ? #% The efficiency of the Union will be greatly improved as soon as the Commission is granted sufficient executive authority to act without the constant interference of the Council . #% That said , of course , we have to acknowledge that there are major difficulties which need to be addressed in the years to come , particularly in agriculture and the Regional Fund and in the decision-making structure . #% It is a rather lengthy journey , so I had plenty of time on my hands . #% So I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal , which is Amendment 43 , to send this back to the committee so that we can come up with something which will actually deliver the help we want to give to Pakistan . #% If and when we do have one , that will be a problem for next year . #% If we do not get an agreement , I should like to point out to the Greek Presidency that if there is another trialogue next week , it can certainly be held in Athens because two of us from that body will be there next week . #% I completely agree with her on how the question of country-of-origin marking is going to be handled . #% I would suggest that developing countries which are highly dependent on textiles and clothing , but are not necessarily classified as least-developed countries , should be exempted temporarily from the existing rules of origin requirements . #% This is a very ambitious project , and such an exercise needs to be seriously undertaken and properly funded . #% Finally , does the Commission not agree that this series of events demonstrates serious defects in the approval process laid down in Directive 90/220 controlling the deliberate release into the environment of genetically-modified organisms , and will it please tell us what steps it is bringing forward to ensure an urgent review of that directive . #% Mr Campoy Zueco has done a great deal of work on this and has been very honest , very fair and very just . #% In this case , the Presidency has unilaterally chosen what to do regardless of any other opinions which might exist in other Member States . #% . I should like to congratulate and thank all those involved . #% However , we must guard against complacency to ensure that , in the long term , more binding and transparent legislation is forthcoming . #% We need effective labelling , effective and comprehensive testing and pharmaceutical advice if patients are to make a genuine , informed choice about over-the-counter prescriptions . #% The question that now begins to arise in the debate is whether we should go one stage further . #% Let us drive forward the whole single market agenda , which is still too incomplete . #% It came as no surprise to me that the Swedes have decided that they do not want to abolish their national currency . #% Some in her party have asked why that should be there . #% Looking at Amendment No 7 , for example , which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances , you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic . #% Hushkits are important but noise pollution is only one aspect of the environmental damage from the airline industry . #% Europe needs improved transport links now . #% I would also like to add my thanks to Mr El Khadraoui , the Socialist shadow rapporteur , because we managed to table a number of compromise amendments which , with his help and help from other Groups , have alleviated some of the problems , because there were a number of disagreements . #% Mr President , the role of the Centre is to provide education and training as the foundation for social integration , lasting regional development and successful economic transformation . #% It reasonably allows police and judicial authorities to access , under certain conditions when investigating serious crimes , data on past electronic communications : that is , who has called who , not the content of the conversations . #% How right that is ! #% We are debating the second draft , which was more acceptable : he had toned it down . #% There is an urgent requirement for a properly coordinated and funded programme of action to enable the resumption of mine action operations at least at the level they had reached before last September . #% Health and wealth , ill-health and poverty are inextricably entwined . #% The report also points out the developments in the area of developing and implementing the , where much still needs to be done to build up the administrative and judicial capacity not only to have laws on paper and in Parliament , but to ensure that they are implemented in such a way that they can play a real and positive role in the lives of citizens . #% Mr President , in a few weeks ' time the European Union will be choosing the governor of the European Central Bank and Britain 's future bank manager . #% Granted it is absent to be at a trialogue , but they were the people who double-booked the meeting ! #% Last but not least , the Commission will be coming forward with its review of the New Transatlantic Agenda , and we in this House have insisted on many occasions -- and once again in the joint resolution -- that we should take the opportunity to upgrade this relationship ; show that it is visible to the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic , and not exclude , as the new transatlantic agenda does today , the political communities . #% I therefore abstained on votes to all amendments because I will not accept even those that might be seen to be helpful ; this is a matter for the UK alone . #% First of all , candidates for early retirement will be selected solely according to the interests of the services . #% It is essential , therefore , that this Parliament protect her position , maintain the rights of petitioners and stand up to the British Government . #% But the compromises we have reached are reasonable . #% At least last week Council renewed its targeted sanctions , but these are not being applied with any real vigour ; they are not hurting Mugabe 's cronies . #% Unless the correct version of political history is submitted in their course work and in their examinations students now find themselves penalised in their exam marking . #% Such accountability is merited , not only to satisfy Europe 's democratic needs , but also and more importantly to shore up the credentials of the bank itself . #% My report was adopted by 420 votes to nil in the European Parliament . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , Britain is not signed up to Schengen , so technically this proposal should not apply to the UK . #% Mr Bourlanges , I congratulate you on your approach to the budget . #% Agencies were also advising companies on ways to present their higher-risk products as low risk , and this misleading practice meant that these products turned out to be more toxic than their rating would suggest and led to huge losses for investors , including pension holders across Wales . #% We also want to have some kind of input into the kind of agreement that is being reached , hence the emphasis that the financial contribution must be used for the development of coastal populations living on fisheries . #% Mr President , my Group welcomes the opportunity to discuss the current situation in the DRC , but like others deeply regrets the need to come back to this . #% This week I met with iatrogenic patients . #% 
In conclusion , a number of short points : renewable energies can not be shoe-horned into the current thinking of energy suppliers , who are trained to see energy production as always being large scale and costing hundreds or thousands of millions of euros in terms of each project . #% We have to look forward to a system of government that would allow the Balkans finally to be at peace , enabling economic reconstruction to go ahead and prosperity to be built for the future . #% Having said that , we are of course , prepared to listen to the Council , to hear what their suggestions are and I look forward to our trialogue this week and the conciliation meeting on 20 July . #% Many Belarussians support eventual EU membership for their country , although if asked they also claim to support union with Russia . #% The Commission , therefore , has the responsibility to present formal proposals to repeal or amend secondary legislation which is not coherent with the principles and limits defined in Article 18 ( 3 ) of the regulation . #% Sri Lanka has made progress in recent years ; how much more could have been achieved in terms of rapid economic and social development if there had been stability and security ? #% Mr President , my group deplores the way this matter has been handled in the last few weeks . #% Is this because of the matters Mrs Buitenweg raised about Member States not wanting to use these funds ? #% Commissioner Barrot , why do I find myself in the same position again today ? #% Tourism and agriculture have a particular problem because of different working patterns and because of the times of year that they work . #% Homosexuals are stoned to death , there is religious persecution , and children are abducted into war , not to mention the obscenities of rape and terrorism , torture and false disappearances - a catalogue of almost unutterable suffering which grows year on year . #% Up to 900 , 000 new jobs in the European Union are attributable to the functioning of the single European market . #% These tax aspects are under discussion with all involved parties in the context of the Green Paper . #% Will the British electorate know about this at the time of the British general election , probably in May ? #% Mr Ford has called for Fiji to be banned from all sporting events . #% We were due to have heard from the chief executive of EFSA this week . #% He was too polite . #% For the first time in EU legislation , we will have a sunset clause that will remove the powers of the Commission and the committee after four years unless they are used wisely and well . #% Things are starting to move , but everyone here is impatient for that movement to be much more positive and much more rapid . #% I am glad the Commission has recognised that in terms of the amendments it has accepted from Parliament . #% In that context , we emphasise the importance of the partnership principle and of the broadest possible involvement of all competent authorities and appropriate bodies in developing strategies at regional and/or national level as appropriate to the Member State concerned . #% I have no problem burdening industry where there are real advantages to improving environmental standards , but such perverse decisions like today 's only threatens support for future environmental legislation and public support . #% Possibly we need to look at something like a RECHAR or RESIDER programme for agriculture , but action is needed very , very quickly . #% Indeed , in the last war over one third of the population of Belarus lost their lives . #% The number of chapters is increasing and I am pleased to announce that the Commission could receive all the position papers from the Ministry by Christmas , if it is able to do so . #% The French built the power station across La Ranche estuary demonstrating the technology ; in the UK both the Mersey , on a small scale , and the Severn , on a massive scale , are suitable sites . #% It is very important that people realise that . #% The future European Union is already split between 18 countries which have declared one view and three or four which have declared the opposite . #% That is Mr Pasty 's explanation and I am not going to query it . #% There is a lot of talk about smart regulation at the moment , but I think this is a classic example of smart regulation . #% I commend the report particularly for not falling into the trap of favouring existing parties . #% We acknowledge in our frequent progress reports the shortcomings , the target dates that we have missed , as well as the ones that we have bettered . #% Not least , there must be maximum cohesion between trade and development policy . #% There can be no question that this issue was seen as a major asset , enabling the Communities to foster active engagement of the citizens of Europe in the construction of that project . #% Thank you for that response , even if it was not quite the one I wanted . #% Secondly with regard to the United States : not only have they failed to introduce internal legislation to bring their market into line with the GPA , they have failed to eliminate the ` Buy American ' Act . #% That legal personality depends on the ratification of the European Constitution that the European Union intends to stuff down the throats of the peoples of Europe whether they want it or not . #% 9/11 and its effects on the World Trade Center were insured by large reinsurance companies such as Lloyds and others for the kinds of catastrophes that we had hoped would not occur . #% We want the Commission to make sure that the agreement takes full account of the sustainable management of fisheries resources , particularly with regard to tuna stocks . #% In voting the report , the Committee on Fisheries rejected each of these three changes . #% Their Amendment No 12 seeks to delete reference to the need for family unity in Europe . #% The one-size-fits-all monetary policy and single currency will inevitably lead to foreign direct investment flowing to the Member State with the lowest income and corporation tax rates . #% Secondly , on the timetable . #% For example the main message coming from the Afghan Government at the moment is that international pledges made in Tokyo are not being fulfilled and the government therefore can not conduct its business . #% As a Member of Parliament who has sat through this question-and-answer session , I find it particularly unsatisfactory that , after a lot of statements , the President-in-Office has , in the end , such a short period of time in which to answer about 83 questions . #% It was obviously a shocking incident , although we have to put it in perspective : a lot worse has happened to other Members of this House . #% Every insurance company will , therefore , need to appoint a representative in each Member State . #% I would like Mr Kinnock to explain how he is going to move these forward as quickly as possible , because that warning is as valid now as it was when Parliament approved the report a few months ago . #% Even 79 % of the British Conservatives supported the Spinelli draft Treaty -- they then sat in a different political group . #% We need to understand the potential impact of anything that the European Union , or indeed the Commonwealth , does in order to tackle what is happening in Zimbabwe . #% My supplementary deals with the question of sharing the burden on counter-terrorism between the United States and the European Union . #% I am sorry that the PPE-DE Group insisted on forcing amendments to the article on family reunion . #% But , in line with what John Blundell , the Director-General of the IEA , said just the other day : do you recognise that the overwhelming majority of British businesses now want British withdrawal from the common commercial policy and for us to get back to running our own trade policy ? #% Allowing Britain 's contribution to rise from an average of GBP 3 billion net to more than GBP 6 billion per annum from 2007 is totally unacceptable and squanders Mrs Thatcher 's hard-earned rebate . #% Much is promised but , sadly , not a lot of it is delivered . #% At the same time Brussels , too , is clearly more than just an element for consideration by the Commission in this process . #% I hope , for the sake of Londoners , that we will stick to deadlines that are as tight as possible . #% I too would like to welcome Nicole Péry back here in the Chamber and perhaps I could say , Nicole , that we miss you particularly when we have extremely difficult votes to transact . #% He wanted me to say that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party welcomes this very strongly because it is a major breakthrough in the single market and for the Lisbon agreement into a sector which has previously been closed . #% What did he expect ? #% Alternatively , make their situation worse and they will simply dig in more . #% It strikes me that some authorities are continuing to prevaricate , in one country at least . #% While I have said that there may be little incentive in some quarters to choose this , that does not mean it is because small companies do not conduct cross-border business or do not aspire to do so . #% Our resolution today sets out clearly what has to be done . #% One way to combat this is through further development of microbicides . #% The Charter of Fundamental Rights was included in the new Constitution as one of the most misconceived documents of recent years . #% 
Less than a hundred pounds , ten minutes on the phone and you can do business anywhere . #% You have our full support , Mr Bourlanges , and we hope that Parliament endorses the Committee on Budgets ' proposals in the vote this week . #% My preference is for the existing paragraph 17 , which states that we should evaluate our political priorities , then their needs , and only then should Parliament decide on what the level of own resources should be . #% One problem is vested interests - the classic example being the fossil fuel industries ; another is weak political leadership by all of us - we are all responsible for this . #% This is difficult and not to be contemplated without competent and specialised legal advice . #% When we have divergence in this Union , we talk it through to find a solution to make it acceptable to everyone , recognising the majority trend and trying to find out what adjustments might be necessary to make the minority able to accept it as well . #% The Commission has made it quite clear that they understand that the fishing industry is not economically viable in some respects , but that is not the result of extra fuel prices . #% This is a much-needed reform of the whole package . #% I would like to make just one other point . #% Progress in China will inevitably be limited to the economic sphere for as long as the Chinese Communist Party retains power . #% We have heard the same words over and again that we need to ensure that Israel does this or does that , but we need the real leverage to make that happen , otherwise Israel will simply ignore us , as it continues to do . #% There were some , though -- particularly the extension of the scope to inert waste -- which I felt were misguided . #% The freedom of the press is also not of the standard that we would expect . #% This is an insult to the Members of the European Parliament . #% The very adjective ` atypical ' in the name of this directive says it all . #% Its proposals for a gradual reduction over a period of time of that subsidy make sense , and it is time the Council and the Commission started talking about this issue . #% If no new legislation is necessary , can I urge you to look again at the existing measures and self-regulation -- which I am not at all certain is accurate -- and see whether they are working or whether they need strengthening ? #% The UK operated Commonwealth preference up to 1972 without great problems . #% The report also calls on the Commission to support the process of integrating these environmental objectives in energy policy through research into the impact of climate change , through research into all possible technologies , through research into identifying the best indicators to measure achievements in reducing emissions and through regular reports to Parliament . #% In the general framework agreement with the Commission , we have a one-month deadline . #% We want the private sector to invest in tourism , but to do so responsibly , to develop tourism projects that contribute to the local economy and help micro-businesses to grow , so that local people benefit and local produce is consumed . #% We very much want to see a Development Commissioner with a remit which covers our development work across the world . #% Closer cooperation between our police and security services is important . #% I particularly refer to one of the opinions from EMAC , in which our colleague , who unfortunately is not here , said he wanted to simplify matters by raising thresholds but at the same time he wanted to allocate 15 % of contracts to SMEs . #% Was it at a lower level , at COREPER ? #% Thirdly , the report calls for more help for small businesses , which are particularly affected by rising fuel prices and in need of energy efficiency . #% I also welcome the concession by the Commission -- and I gather the Council will also fall into line on this -- to set up a dedicated instrument for human rights and democracy that will facilitate the EU 's priority support for building greater values of human rights , democracy and freedom in the rest of the world . #% Information is made available in some states , sometimes accurately and accessibly and in a range of different languages based on a wide range of data . #% Mr President , I would just like to address this question of better regulation . #% With those reservations , we commend Mr Ford 's report to the House and we shall be voting for all the amendments in his report apart from Nos 1 and 12 . #% Businesses are not allowed to ask a woman if she is going to have a baby , so it is easy - they just do not employ her . #% We do not want to be in a position of merely recording that the election was fixed and standing back and wringing our hands afterwards . #% Mrs Klamt 's remarks and her interpretation saddened me . #% As proposed at the talks in Drogheda , the militias operated by the parties must be dissolved and replaced by a single Kurdish armed force under the control of a Kurdish elected authority . #% The reality is that the European social model is now living in London and she is called Laetitia Casta . #% I trust that all these provisions will equip Parliament to cope with privilege cases at the federal level coordinate with , but not subordinate to , national parliamentary regimes . #% Contingency plans must be checked and re-checked , rehearsed and re-examined so that we are not in the unprepared state we were in at the last outbreak . #% Russia must not be allowed to turn the clock back to authoritarianism and abandon its respect for democracy and human rights . #% Thanks to the strenuous efforts made by Mr Dixon and his colleagues , Pillar 4 is working well , though faced with enormous problems due to the legal and institutional vacuum in Kosovo . #% We therefore welcome the fact that the common position clearly states this will not happen . #% I think you have probably heard a host of political speeches in this Parliament today about the Court of Auditors ' reports and how people are framing themselves , looking forward to discharge . #% Member States have different ways of looking at the role of the state in economic and social life , the family 's place in society and its rights and duties , the roles of men and women in the family and children 's rights . #% I should like to close by supporting the comments about the amendment , namely , that we all look to the Commission to give us an assurance on the issue of the further voluntary code . #% Every newspaper I open has stories about the euro . #% Excluding population pressure , political instability and regional war , it is clear that the main pressure stems from economic disparities . #% - This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States . #% I shall support compromise Amendment No 16 to get rid of the best-advice principle , which would impose unacceptable burdens on the industry . #% Full-scale cooperation between the European Union and the United States of America , as well as with other key democracies such as India , is a prerequisite for peace . #% The unique feature is that this will apply irrespective of the flag state . #% What is wrong with a little humanity in trying to maintain employment in the Third World ? #% There has been a degree of cynicism about this change of approach , but nevertheless it represents some sort of step forward in the relations between the United States and the Middle East . #% What will the international community do ? #% Under those conditions , compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure would disappear . #% Montenegro should be judged solely on merit , facts and achievements . #% The Council is negotiating agreements on mutual legal assistance , extradition and exchange of personal data with the United States , involving Europol-FBI cooperation . #% On the question of application interfaces and the technology , the key word is ` interoperability ' . #% It does not promote democracy , it reduces it . #% Therefore this German initiative - one for which I am very pleased to be the rapporteur - is aimed at trying to bring the matter effectively and efficiently to a conclusion . #% China is a big and powerful country and it is inevitable that our governments must maintain political , diplomatic and trading relations with them . #% It is absolutely clear that the next phase of the internal market has to be in services ; we all know that . #% Patients suffering from sleeping sickness , leish-maniasis , dengue , trachoma and many others are given , too often , archaic drugs , some highly toxic , some ineffective . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , this legislation will allow the EU to throw money at referendum campaigns to ensure that it purchases the right result first time , for a change ! #% In many cases , if they have shown reluctance to accept those changes or have supported colleagues who are reluctant to accept those changes , they have found that so-called performance related pay has been withheld and the normal increments that they could have expected under their previous conditions of service have not been paid . #% That is why it is very important that we keep the discussions flowing and work for the benefit of agriculture . #% Reading Mr Kindermann 's excellent report - and I do not say that just out of politeness , it is an outstanding report - it came as quite a shock to learn that 30 % of the world catch , some 30 million tonnes , is used for industrial fisheries . #% But such good work can be undermined . #% 
Ten per cent of people between fifteen and fifty years of age are living with AIDS , and there are 10 million orphans . #% I just wish that Member States will now enforce that regulation better . #% But may I say with respect that now that he has become part of the government he acquired the government 's habit of not answering the question . #% The Mugabe regime is a criminal racket and a major factor of instability , not just in southern Africa but , as the report makes clear , in central Africa as well . #% We have already heard about the impact of the surge in textile imports on the EU and the devastation some EU producers face as a result . #% That led to the creation of budgetary chapter B7-700 , now known as the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights . #% That is why I make a plea to the Commission to act upon this report , especially on paragraphs 4 and 7 where we ask for specific action from the Commission . #% We have to provide answers for our citizens . #% What we have done with the Belliard building may not be ideal but at least it is a step in the right direction , and it is now off our backs . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner when we are likely to see a situation when an English-owned company will be able to sell electricity to the French Prime Minister . #% I am sorry to have to say to the Commissioner that I do not think the Commission can entirely wash its hands of responsibility for the way this situation has developed . #% Many bankers and finance workers died in that attack . #% Having said that , we should always bear in mind that Turkey is essentially an agrarian society rapidly transforming itself into an industrial society . #% I hope we will have an overwhelming vote in favour of the compromise amendments , with the agreement of the Council , and that we will therefore have a prospectus directive later in July when the Ecofin Council meets again . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , I should like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for that statement . #% We had a very serious debate in committee on the word non-professional : a whole range of interest groups from around Europe said they could accept the compromise if non-professional was deleted ; now it has been . #% I would have been more convinced if he had taken up the issue of funding for Iraq where , as a political group last year , we asked for EUR 500m to be put in , but everyone threw up their arms and said that we would not be able to find that sum of money . #% In that way we will maintain workers ' safety while continuing to allow businesses the flexibility they need to thrive in the modern marketplace . #% How that person is chosen will be a factor in the fight to restore and strengthen the political authority of the Commission . #% We must , however , look beyond the regulation to other means of helping cod recovery and of moving to sustainable fisheries overall . #% What we do need are economic policies that respect the rights of our Member States , stimulate the sharing of best practice and focus on delivering EU added value ; policies which defend the benefits of the internal market and extend them further ; policies which provide a climate in which entrepreneurs and businesses can thrive in order to create jobs , raise our standard of living and contribute to a stronger society . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on an important Commission proposal . #% We also have to look at how we develop legislation which can be properly implemented . #% And , given that the heightened terrorist threat to aviation today is one which is ever growing , this proposal offers important improvements for passenger safety and security . #% I am pleased the conference was able to find a mechanism to deal with these problems now rather than wait until we have negotiated full European Union membership . #% Why not think of an annual Atlantic Summit , which would bring together the EU , the US and NATO , because politics , economics and security policy are increasingly interlinked . #% The Liberal Group has put down two amendments to the Senegal agreement and one on Mauritius . #% But to do this they died a tragic and desperate death because as Europeans we failed to come up with common and workable procedures for asylum and immigration and that must be on all our consciences . #% That is why the report was referred back to committee . #% A further impediment to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives , and all for what ? #% in writing . - We are not in favour of the European Union being responsible for help to redundant workers ( or for anything else ) . #% I would like to err on the side of caution . #% Unfortunately - and this is the problem - currently funding mechanisms , including the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership , allocate very limited funding to the very costly late-stage clinical trials - phase 2B and phase 3 - which are vital to demonstrate vaccine safety . #% It seems clear that , whether committed to writing or not , such a guarantee was indeed given and that the Commission , having sat silent at the many meetings at which that guarantee has been mentioned since , was quite content to allow everyone to continue with that understanding until it became opportune to go back to that legal opinion . #% I was sent to this Parliament to use my best endeavours to arrest the march of EU regulations or mitigate their effect . #% We had it at the end of the last Parliament ; we have seen some of the issues raised by the many speeches here today , which , in many cases , have vastly overplayed the problems but underplayed the opportunities . #% The German authorities have continued to charge Iranian officials with responsibility for the killing of Kurdish leaders in Berlin in 1992 and there have been allegations about the importation of weapons even into Belgium , possibly for outrages there . #% Although they may nominally be the courts of the Member States and their running costs are paid for by the Member States , they are - as the draftsman so clearly reminded us - courts of Community law underlying the whole Community judicial system . #% The specific needs of the elderly regarding health care need much more attention , especially in rural areas . #% Global warming is a major issue but , of course , it is not the only environmental issue that we confront . #% But we should look upon these efforts in positive terms and with understanding . #% It is obvious to us that unless we factor the environment into our economic thinking there will no chance of having a sustainable economy . #% But the EU should also be united , solid and active on human rights . #% It is deeply regrettable that the British Government , unlike its Danish partner , is not cross-examined or mandated in the House of Commons before deciding on its voting position in the Council of Ministers . #% Unfortunately , the answer is not quite straightforward . #% Mr President , the aim of policy regarding Iraq is not to avoid war at any price and it is not merely to see the return of weapons inspectors . #% This House was built on the ashes of the Second World War . #% Only an IGC could change Article 202 , which basically gives sole rights of oversight of committees to the Council of Ministers , ignoring the new role of Parliament . #% Mr President , I would invite Parliament to avail itself of Article 69 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure and refer the report back to committee to pursue negotiations with the Commission . #% The issue of inter-country adoptions is more complex than national adoption , but I am very grateful to the PPE Group for bringing this issue forward . #% We must move on from the endless debate on constitutional mechanics and get on with delivering results , because if we do not do that , citizens will conclude that their leaders have learned nothing . #% I would like to draw the Commissioner 's attention to the following point : some states have been very slow to designate Natura 2000 sites at all . #% This is not an idea we have plucked out of the air . #% Parliament 's resolution includes the suggestion that ` European citizenship ' should be a ` standard element in school curricula throughout the EU ' . #% I shall never forget , as a minister responsible for fighting drugs , going and meeting a young man who had lost his health and his friends and his relationships , his family , his jobs , his prospects and his self-respect . #% The EPP/ED Group is not just talking about the needs of the disabled : we are actually doing something positive about it . #% I should like to deal very quickly with four issues and hope that the President-in-Office of Ecofin will have the chance to respond to these . #% It is deploying the most outrageous bullying tactics to get small countries to sign bilateral immunity agreements . #% We are now working to increase awareness of Fair Trade issues amongst the population in Wales . #% I successfully introduced amendments to allow establishments such as zoos and wildlife parks to remain open , provided there is no threat to disease control . #% But they have moved ahead . #% Are they going to try and stop young people studying the works of Plato , Shakespeare , Oscar Wilde , Walt Whitman , Tennessee Williams , Tchaikovsky and others , the music of Elton John , or idolising tennis greats such as Martina Navratilova ? #% It is good , from the point of view of the Legal Affairs Committee , that we are now getting on with the task of making the crucial reforms to the Staff Regulations that will be needed to implement these reforms . #% Now our crowded islands are full and we seek to balance the number of those coming in against the number of those leaving . #% We also agree with a lot that the Commissioner said about the ownership of this employment strategy . #% I had the opportunity in May this year to visit Mongolia for the first time as a participant in the Socialist International 's Asia-Pacific Committee in Ulan Bator . #% 
in writing . - This report looks at the progress that has been made towards a European global satellite navigation system , or Galileo , and looks at issues regarding the future governance of the initiative . #% Illegal logging is a hugely serious problem , against which the EU has preached for many years , yet all the while continuing to provide one of the world 's biggest markets for illegally logged timber and timber products . #% Our priority has to be to give the consumer real choice . #% I am afraid that at the moment the jury is out . #% One of the things I want to talk about briefly is the role of the state-controlled media in the run-up before the election . #% On independent regulation , we regard this as essential if an internal market is to develop , because it provides the predictability and stability which consumers and new entrants need ; but it should be for the Member State to reflect the different structures of national markets . #% We prefer the emphasis that our own amendment places on how the Lisbon Strategy should address deficiencies in the current social situation . #% The growth rate this year is 1.5 % , which I imagine will be estimated as even lower by the end of the year . #% There is not a fixed list of countries that fit into that category . #% I welcome Commissioner Verheugen 's plans in relation to Bulgaria and Romania , but we must also send out a message to Romania that it has to get its act together , otherwise it will seriously fall behind schedule . #% The Commission should also consult local and regional authorities at all stages of legislation relating to the regions to make them more accountable in producing a more results-oriented policy . #% Madam President , last night the Committee on Budgets and , I understand , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy discussed this matter . #% With the great events taking place in the world , it was as if the Stockholm Summit was ignoring them . #% There are fears that e-commerce may be strangled at birth by regulations which potentially expose traders to 15 different European legal jurisdictions whilst at the same time the very same regulations could fail to really give our citizens easy or affordable access to justice . #% Mr President , it is certainly good , as Mr Wynn said , that we have this kind of generalised debate . #% Well , that may be true in the case of Belgium - which has not had a government for six months - but for the rest of us , right across every Member State in this Union ( and perhaps this is why we see the fear in the faces ) , people are increasingly saying : ` We do n't want that flag , we do n't want the anthem , we do n't want this political class , we want the whole thing consigned to the dustbin of history ' . #% Could I ask through you , Mr President , that the Council or , failing that , the Commissioner , makes a statement to Parliament ? #% No proper Muslim in the world will support the treatment of women that has been meted out by the bestial Afghan sadists and torturers . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for his words about the report . #% She said that Europeans are quite `` scandalised by untrammelled capitalism , whose relocations , social dumping , ruthless exploitation ... and remorseless pursuit of profit at the expense of working men and women have a direct and traumatic effect on their lives . '' #% The first amendment was to make sure that national information centres or relevant authorities or police forces , if offered information , would agree to their use in legal proceedings in the Member State where the football fan was arrested . #% It is in our best interests that young farmers are well prepared to anticipate and to manage these future challenges . #% There are many nominees with Communist backgrounds . #% But are we moving fast enough to keep up with a changing market ? #% Mr President , before I speak to the resolution , can I clear up a translation error . #% The Commission can confirm that the appointment of a Portuguese official as Director-General for Press and Communication was firmly based on the principles that were set out by the Prodi Commission when we took office in 1999 , and specifically those principles which require that merit is the prime consideration in taking appointment decisions and that every effort should be made consistent with the provisions of the staff regulations , to respect the need for a balance of nationalities in senior management positions . #% We have gone as far as we can to satisfy those people with specific ethical concerns on those issues and with regard to other new technologies . #% Mr President , should you not be asking us to vote for the text ? #% The record of implementation of EU decisions that are taken is poor . #% We are beyond discussing legislation , and it is time you recognised that you are seeking to become masters in someone else 's house , and that is intolerable . #% I would need to be able to say that these are Commissioners whom I , and the citizens of Europe , can wholeheartedly trust . #% There is the problem of legitimacy , and the Commission has the problem of credibility . #% The message , however , is clear to national customs services : we benefit from the single market , we want cross-Community trade to grow , and we want the customs services to cooperate , as it says : to operate as if they were one . #% The European Union would be a vastly better place if all the proposals enshrined in this report were to be adopted . #% Moreover , the intelligence operations of third countries , including the United States , operating in cooperation with British intelligence services within the United Kingdom , are also subject to the same democratic oversight . #% The main thrust of European audiovisual policies is being provided by the Television with Frontiers directive . #% I can not agree with a common consolidated corporate tax base as there is no agreement for this . #% I will now give the floor to Mr Watson who will speak on behalf of the committee responsible , the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs . #% The time has come for us internationally to demand an end to these atrocities . #% If we are looking at real co-development , that will be a major step forward and I welcome that . #% He also said that it does not come into operation until 2003 . #% I hope it will do that not simply because it represents a compromise in those positions but because it is the most appropriate way forward . #% We can debate the causes of the collapse at Cancún . #% How do you see our relations improving in that direction ? #% The first is that there must be a sense of shared responsibility . #% The ELDR remains unambiguously supportive of further trade liberalisation , of the strengthening of the multilateral trade system and of a broadly based negotiation covering a wide range of existing and new trade matters . #% I certainly have been very pleased that such a working party is being set up and that it is going to be reasonably broad-based . #% I must admit , though , that I did enjoy Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz 's intervention ! #% Mr President , those of us who come from regions with permanent structural disadvantages have real reason to be grateful to Mr Pomés Ruiz for his report and the innovative ideas it contains . #% I would also point out that f-gases were pushed onto the market as replacements for CFCs , which cause ozone depletion and skin cancers , precisely by the same big chemical companies -- like DuPont or , in my own country , Ineos , as ICI is now known -- that were , themselves , major producers of ozone-destroying substances . #% This is why my group on this side of the Chamber makes no apologies for supporting a common European asylum policy , believing that it is the only way forward for the European Union . #% I mean the investment of the communities that underpin and sustain them . #% Mrs Palacio is quite right about the volume of legislation and documentation surrounding this area . #% Mr President , the EU is in crisis in terms of direction and legitimacy , and Mr Blair is now under challenge to fill the leadership vacuum , with Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder weakened domestically and probably on their way out . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for that general response . #% Let us not dilute the message in any way . #% Human rights problems in Latvia and Slovakia would never have been dealt with without the positive prospects of European Union membership and Turkey should be treated in the same way . #% Of course , we will need full information to continue to spread the word . #% I just do not feel that this is happening at the moment . #% Of course , we are not at the end of the budget procedure but already in this big , first public debate we have come a considerable way . #% In a couple of months we will be moving to the Commission proposal which is even slightly weaker . #% Often constituents come to me because as individuals they have difficulties opening bank accounts . #% It points out that there are difficulties faced which need resolution , even though this regulation may not be the place to do it . #% The European social model is well meaning , it is compassionate , it is meant to do good and yet it has created a regulatory and fiscal climate which is deterring enterprise , destroying wealth and undermining competitiveness . #% Would the Commission be willing to undertake to propose the creation of a European Union agency , under its control , which would coordinate the work of the relevant national agencies in our Member States in the field of communicable diseases ? #% We simply do not need this post of European Data -- Protection Supervisor and I strongly urge Members to vote against this amending budget and , just for once , to say ` no ' to the EU empire builders . #% 
For example , there will be progress on battery hens , there will be progress on conditions in zoos . #% Today , our resolution does not reflect the sort of leadership which is available for the people of Afghanistan through their exiled king . #% Sadly she did not live to see her exiled son and grandson allowed to return to their homeland . #% Now we have Najaf . #% It is a Europe that builds on what we have in common and does not set up barriers to highlight our differences . #% Property owners in Valencia have had their property and land confiscated on a massive scale and built on by often unscrupulous property developers and local authorities , acting with the connivance of the Valencian authorities under the terms of the LRAU . #% But , as I say , that is a cynical comment . #% Savings are used to save for old age , periods of sickness , helping children through studies and helping grandchildren . #% It has been something of a marathon and a lot of hard work , but he has done a very good job . #% For that reason I believe that European funding for European-wide political activity , be it for or against the European Union , should be considered seriously , so long as that activity remains within the accepted parameters of Western values . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner how she intends to put pressure on Member States to make sure that water is not the expensive luxury that no-one can afford . #% We are all allies in the task of removing obstacles to free movement related to supplementary pensions and making progress towards achieving a fundamental principle of the Treaty . #% So there are no Commission hang-ups then about the working-time directive , as long it is the poor exploited workers of India who are involved ! #% Would you please raise the question , obtain a list of the worst criminals in Europe and help the public find them ? #% Mr Blokland has rightly observed that it is a bit of a fudge . #% Therefore , I would like to apologise to Parliament for not being here to present my report and also to thank Mrs Theato for moving it during the debate . #% I also hope that this parliamentarians ' meeting will be held in Europe , although not necessarily here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg , the location of the first ASEP meeting in 1996 . #% There is no point in having that legislation if you are against it in the first place . #% Mr President , along with most colleagues in this House , I have very serious concerns about the proposals before us . #% I hope that the Agency will rise to the challenges we have posed . #% In that context if it is complex then we need a series of ideas and initiatives and solutions to ensure that we can try and take away the terrible feeling of insecurity that now exists within the European Union . #% This question and motion outlines ways in which racism must be documented and prevented and sanctions implemented . #% We must ensure that prevention , detention and warning mechanisms for natural hazards in Europe and across the globe are robust and put our citizens -- from Carlisle to Kashmir -- in the best position to prevent , prepare for and respond to disasters . #% It has been declared by the World Health Organization as having the potential of a major epidemic because it is a disease of prosperity , unfortunately . #% I invite Council to take the last few steps to reach an agreement with us on this . #% We recognise the acuteness of feelings , especially since the work of the information system and centres is of clear importance not only to Members of this House , but also to anyone committed to developing an understanding of the European Union , what it does and what it stands for . #% Since the Commissioner may have a little more influence than me , I wonder if besides me taking the matter up , the Commissioner could advise this body - I know it can do no more , it can not interfere - that a Member has raised this matter and that the Commission is disturbed about it . #% There has been a lot of misinformation on this , not least stirred up by the Conservatives in the United Kingdom - tabloid headlines about outrageous plots by the EU to force the UK to accept refugees ' gay lovers . #% Although these developments were hailed as a major contribution to health and safety at work , the Commission has consistently undermined this Act . #% Encouragement and support , however , call for more than just a few kind words ; they entail active assistance in accessing the necessary financial means and specific measures to remove all existing social and administrative barriers to women 's full participation and progress in all areas of the fisheries sector . #% Although the two big groups are proposing it , so it looks as though it will go through . #% In general terms , there is a need to build up an awareness amongst architects and potential customers of the technologies that are available . #% Given how long this has been going on - you mentioned the directive going back to 1983 - how long will it be before your task force produces proposals for action ? #% I urge colleagues concerned about child protection and adoptions in Romania to go straight upstairs and speak to these experts . #% I did vote against the Rothley report because I take the view that , with all its faults , we should have accepted the proposed Statute for Members that came from the Council . #% Mr President , I am very pleased to be here today for more than one reason because , looking around the room , perhaps I am one of the few people who was actually here when we first wrote the packaging directive . #% I would , first of all , like to thank the Commissioner for his very full and frank responses . #% It is not credible in my view that Turkey can justify the permanent closure of this border with Armenia because of its so-called solidarity with its Turkic brother , Azerbaijan , over the unresolved NK dispute . #% In the absence of action by the Council , is it any wonder that we need an agency that will monitor , report and bring forward recommendations and thereby hold every single Member State to its international obligations ? #% I also think it is not necessary . #% Can we guarantee the consumer that labelling will show the country of origin of production ? #% I find it surprising that Mrs Honeyball is supporting so warmly a report that promotes tax harmonisation on the very day that Gordon Brown is all over the Daily Telegraph saying that he does not like tax harmonisation . #% As the President -- in -- Office knows well -- although I do not think he is listening to me -- the problem is trust between the agencies . #% What has he got to do with what his great-grandfather did during the Fascist era ? 80 % of Italians in a recent poll believe these people should be allowed to return without restrictions . #% The situation facing those non-Spanish nationals in Valencia , including many UK citizens , should be dealt with on a government-to-government basis . #% The European Union comes out stronger . #% But I think it is partly an indication of the fact that this particular programme , like the previous ones , will not actually work . #% I hope it has made the position for the car industry clearer . #% It could be argued that Mr Bangemann is not doing anything strictly wrong because there was not an enforceable Code of Conduct . #% Madam President , at the last part-session in Brussels you very kindly said that you would write to the Greek authorities about the 12 British and two Dutch plane spotters who were arrested . #% Parliament and Commission have been resolute in highlighting the human rights abuses of the brutal - almost disgusting - Ahmadinejad regime . #% We have all heard of awful and tragic cases of child pornography and child exploitation across Europe . #% Let us not allow our reactions to deliver that which the terrorists ' actions can never achieve . #% Firstly you say that a lot of your evidence is based on what CIETT has said to you . #% We have set some very tough targets . #% On the issue of rare diseases , we have also achieved a compromise that is better than what we were pursuing first time round . #% I voted against it in committee and I shall vote against it tomorrow in plenary . #% Not to do so would be a retrograde step . #% Modulation is great as long as it is larger than your particular farm . #% International aviation is not subject to Kyoto or other commitments . #% Mr President , referring to the text adopted yesterday and the issue of human cloning , item 8 in the English version , paragraph 11 , reads ` considers that any temporary committee set up by this Parliament ... ' . #% When it was initially established I resisted its remit extending to cover not just the EU but the territory of the Council of Europe as I believed it would dilute the Centre 's work and cause it to lose its focus on the rising tide of racism , xenophobia and anti-Semitism inside the Union . #% But this misses a vital point . #% Madam President , Mr Newton Dunn is perfectly correct when he draws attention to Rule 2 , but what he forgets is that the elections in 1999 took place under proportional representation . #% We must come back to this issue and put forward a proper proposal on a matter which is of direct concern to this House . #% Do we not have anybody within the European Community , better graphic artists , who could give the boost that is needed to bring this down to a personal level ? #% 
We still support a better deal for junior doctors ; we will still continue to pressure our own government to provide it , but a directive from the European Parliament is clearly not the right way to secure it . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would like to say this to the Minister : as I sat here listening to your statement , I heard what you had to say , but it was mere words - sometimes very sweet words , but unfortunately empty words . #% Mr President , several points come to mind following the Commission statement . #% We appreciate its economic importance . #% So if I were a forger I would start out now forging EUR 500 notes and have a field day for the next few months until people come to terms with it . #% Can I just briefly ask you : would you further agree that the question here is not whether people in developing countries should have equal access to HIV/Aids treatment as people in developed countries - everybody agrees that is necessary - but how to achieve that end ? #% Consumers are receiving proper and appropriate protection from different countries which have been in this very close relationship now for almost 50 years . #% What concrete measures does the presidency propose ? #% Finally , I am sure that Commissioner Monti will not be surprised that I support Lyndon Harrison 's proposals for labour mobility and a common European employment policy . #% We will not have a developed market unless we have investment . #% Now , eventually , we have got to the situation where we are debating an anti-discrimination directive , a possibility at long last that we might push through anti-discrimination legislation on all grounds not covered - disability , age , religion or belief , and sexual orientation . #% It should be a rule that is clear in terms of what facts it applies to . #% I would also like to say in relation to paragraph 33 that it is a matter not just of development aid to the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , but also of the funds to Asia , Latin America , the Mediterranean and other regions . #% However , at the outset we should say that budgetisation would mean that we would no longer stash away hundreds of millions of euro , as has happened under the EDF -- money meant for countries which for various reasons were not efficient spenders . #% Liechtenstein must be a drain on Austria in the way it flouts the system so close by . #% Colleagues have referred to the complexities that we have been addressing in committee and sometimes it has been a little obscure what the outcome would be . #% We must ensure that postal customers , small as well as large , are involved in this whole process . #% This is a safety issue , and as their rapporteur I would ask them to seriously reconsider their opinion . #% Poverty hastens death , and deaths accelerate the survivors ' descent into poverty . #% Our children are the future and the improvements voted through today will provide a better and more secure start to their lives . #% Nevertheless , it is essential that the Commission take serious note of the concerns expressed in the resolution on Eurostat adopted by the European Parliament on 22 April 2004 ; #% Today I would like to set out some of the priorities for my group over the coming years . #% That means a combination of all of four things : agricultural spending reform and deep agricultural spending cuts ; cofinancing in addition to that reform ; a re-evaluation of the cohesion fund countries who have qualified to join the single European currency and therefore an examination of their entitlement together with a capping of the budget and strict budgetary stringency . #% We affirm our support for the central role he is willing to play in the return to democracy of his country . #% I hope that will be corrected . #% Those people are so rarely thanked . #% In these days of free capital flows it is not possible simultaneously to control inflation and the exchange rate . #% In the longer term , we must ensure that we have vision and - as you said Commissioner - we need to have the idea of building civil society in the longer term , not just as some kind of short-term project . #% A cosmetic manufacturer is legally obliged to ensure that its products are safe , both for normal use and for foreseeable misuse . #% Those double standards reek . #% It is not possible without a dramatic expansion of production capacity . #% The report must consider all the issues involving air traffic and adopt a twofold approach as proposed by the Commission . #% But a lot has already been achieved . #% This was the largest explosion of its kind on mainland Britain since the Second World War . #% The Health Council meets on 9 December 2005 and I hope this will make the situation clearer . #% Consequently , we believe that those Members - and there are many of them - who are writing reports , chairing committees , running groups and have legitimate reasons to be here should , on declaration of those objectives , be able to come and do their work in the place that they were elected to do it . #% One thing we can be sure of is that fish do not recognise any border or boundary . #% Mr President , in view of the last speech it is worth reminding this House that ethnic cleansing has gone on in Kosovo for ten years and that refugees were being driven out of their homes long before the NATO bombing . #% Madam President , a number of Members raised a key issue , namely that it is all very well for this Parliament , the Commission and the Council agreeing legislation but how do we ensure that it is respected , not only by all Member States but also with regard to ships flying flags of convenience ? #% Mr President , I also rise on a point of order . #% El Niño and the slash-and-burn forestry clearance policies of Indonesia are a devastating cocktail . #% The rapporteur has been very generous in his interpretation of the Council 's inexplicable 8-month delay in responding to Parliament 's six amendments during the first reading . #% Take Europe 's biggest project , EMU ; a recent conference in Singapore highlighted the enormous trade , commercial and financial opportunities which will deepen between the two economic blocks once the Euro partners the dollar and the yen as a world reserve currency . #% Our aim is to deal with this report most speedily so as not to give the Council any excuse for not moving rapidly to the conclusion of its initial debate on overall simplification - again a point raised in the joint resolution . #% I need to remind him , from a control point of view that we anticipate and look forward to him taking a keen interest in how the budget is implemented by the Commission next year and how he drives it forward from there . #% Whilst some actions have been taken , they have proved to be insufficient . #% The consumer has a right to know . #% I would need to be able to say that these are all Commissioners whose integrity and good judgement are beyond reproach . #% It is , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations . #% In this House , and indeed in our other institutions , we talk too much and do not deliver enough . #% I appreciate that there are examples of this fishing exclusively outside EU waters in many other Member States . #% I just want to conclude by relating a recent experience when I went to the Young Designers Exhibition at Coventry University to see what young designers were looking at in car designs for the future . #% Madam President , there will of course be many Members who will have some direct or indirect financial interest in this matter , in most cases to a rather small extent . #% We should seek to reduce that dependency through measures of efficiency , conservation , substitution and new technologies . #% We have no right to grant discharge . #% Then of course there is the ` get them on board ' scenario , irrespective of whether the plane is going to leave or not . #% Mr Davies has already mentioned that there are some technical issues that we still have to tackle . #% I have been continually concerned at the lack of an assistants ' statute . #% Criticism of the Hague Programme for placing undue emphasis on security considerations at the expense of respect for fundamental rights is justified . #% We have come across small businesses , fishermen and others who have felt that particular schemes affect them and therefore they are interested parties . #% It is crucial that the measures that are introduced to deal with the threat to internal security are proportionate , that they are effective and above all that they safeguard human rights . #% Hopefully , when we come to conciliation , we can get a consensus on all the reports and not just five out of seven . #% Could he look at that issue and at information for disabled people so that blind people through use of braille , deaf people through use of textphone and other visual displays have full access to the information on the trans-European networks ? #% In such a way , the role proposed for Parliament will ensure that this body will remain under close scrutiny and that it will prove to be as legitimate as possible . #% I would be happier with a lot of the UK 's arguments if I felt there really was a concerted effort by the UK Government to apply the rules . #% There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions . #% 
It ignores the fact that , in the EPLA structure , such technical judges would be in the minority among national judges who have been praised by those of the same persuasion as Mr Rocard for their stance in those areas of technology . #% I hope that Parliament will strongly support this proposal because it will play an important role in the completion of the internal energy market . #% But we do not leave it to Member States to evaluate the Balkan countries , for which this evening the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs will vote on their fitness for visa waiver , for visa-free travel - it is the Commission which does the assessment and evaluation , so there is no consistency at all in saying that it should be in the hands of the Member States to judge other states . #% At its heart is Liverpool , the home of the United Kingdom 's first commercial dry dock . #% I welcome her statements in paragraph I that SMEs are the most important source of technological innovation but we must remember , as other colleagues have said , that participation for SMEs is more difficult and we should not expect too much from them . #% In addition , this legislation gives protection to those who want to report on unsafe practices in the food and feed business . #% A further area deserving of greater focus concerns the regions , which can be , and should be , useful intermediaries between the citizen on the one hand and the supranational authorities on the other . #% As we have seen with foot-and-mouth , to adopt the scatter-gun approach to disease control policy of mass culling does nothing to instil confidence in the consumer and only serves to spread further concern . #% The United Kingdom has suffered from terrorism for over 30 years . #% They also produce renewable raw materials that can displace synthetic fibres derived from petroleum and other mineral resources . #% The EU should put its political will behind universal primary education by the year 2015 . #% Mr President , tonight British Members from three different political parties and other colleagues are going to be in agreement , which is a rare occurrence . #% The Commissioner knows that I was the rapporteur on two or three separate IDA proposals and I note with some wry humour that this was long before the phrase ` eGovernment ' was widely used or even invented . #% I have a very brief question on the issue of Sellafield . #% Quite a substantial budget has been proposed for this , totalling EUR 2 billion a year once the working-up phase is complete . #% If you look at Parliament 's diary for 1997 , you will find that 8 and 15 September are actually Sundays and week-ending days , not week-beginning days . #% As Mr Trakatellis said , that is extremely important . #% Do not those people deserve the chance at least to vote in a referendum and have a debate ? #% But emission-sensitive charging already exists : it is called fuel duty . #% How much simpler it would have been if we had been more robust in defending the rights of drug companies to maintain their patent rights all over the world and then negotiated some differences in pricing , according to what the markets could actually bear and , at the same time , insisted that the burden of the drugs bill be picked up by and large by aid packages rather than by raiding the shareholder capital of the major pharmaceuticals . #% My friend , the heroic Russian dissident , Vladimir Bukovsky says of the European Union , ' I have lived in your future and it does n't work . ' #% This motion of censure is not just about Eurostat but about the management culture that this exhibits , which goes unchecked . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to thank all those who have spoken , and especially those who agreed with the report . #% On the other hand , however , no one could perhaps have foreseen such a catastrophic reduction in the numbers present . #% Do we contribute to the cost of peacekeeping ? #% Trade liberalisation is vital if we are to lift these people out of devastating poverty . #% This is important terminology and a classic example of how a number of different provisions have been brought together in a rolling update of the regulatory framework affecting motor vehicles , but one which the industry is expecting . #% Alain Juppé 's myopic deflationary policies were mad in themselves but also a misapplication of the Maastricht Treaty . #% In 1992 I started a small business . #% We welcome the view expressed in this report that we should be looking , for example , at the dubious employment agencies that apply both for EU nationals and third country nationals , and which have become a front for these slavery-like outcomes . #% On the other hand there are issues that need to be clarified in the way that this measure does . #% The EPLP therefore can not support harmonization of blood alcohol levels and speed limits at this time . #% What he does take seriously , however , is Article 16 of the Constitution that commits Member States to a common foreign and security policy . #% I believe we have a really important role to play in defending local sourcing and procurement as a vital instrument of local employment and industrial policy . #% The first are intended to clarify the objectives and tasks of the Agency , improving the link with the priorities of the Community strategy , strengthening the Agency 's capacity for data analysis , focusing more on the needs of SMEs and providing accessible and comprehensible information to final users . #% Wish lists are for the past . #% If similar or more problems occur next year , they might find such a report a bit tougher , unless they choose to actually open up , have a dialogue with our Committee , become more transparent and talk to all of us in this Parliament . #% Until those conditions are satisfied , we can not conclusively say that we would definitely go back into the Berlaymont , however desirable it may be in terms of location and facility . #% Liberal Democrats in the Parliament will be joining in supporting a range of measures to broaden its scope , to extend it to include additional industrial sectors and require it to include other global warming gases in addition to CO2 . #% The lessons of recent years show that where the Western democracies are divided , their interests are damaged . #% Even more importantly , it will also threaten the new economy and the e-economy in the European Union . #% Mrs Gradin has indicated by an indirect route that she would be agreeable to such a release of correspondence but naturally , as a matter of courtesy to her , I prefer to have direct confirmation of her agreement . #% What is particularly striking today is the sheer impotence of this Parliament , together with the contempt with which it is treated by the Council and the Commission . #% I have managed to speak only to Mary Banotti so far , but I can assure you that we will take this matter up . #% If this persists it is the view of many of us that we shall see cases brought before the European Court concerning the lack of mutual recognition of marital status for same-sex couples . #% I have three direct questions for you , Commissioner . #% It was killed by the Irish ` no ' vote in the recent referendum , so the implementation of a space and security and defence policy should also be dead . #% With a third of EU oil being imported from Russia and a quarter from the Middle East -- and those proportions are rising -- we face a structural problem which goes far beyond any short-term crisis . #% Mr President , I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the debate as I am the second vicechairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee with Slovakia . #% I am delighted that Mr Barroso seems to be running on high-octane fuel and long may that continue , but the rising tide of protectionist rhetoric and protectionist actions by Member State governments is unacceptable . #% We must respect the there are deep and genuine public concerns on both sides of this argument and this is what our resolution tries to do . #% I enjoyed the history of what has occurred but I would really like to know what the Council intends to do next . #% There are very serious and clear messages in this report . #% Up to now , it has been particularly important in border regions , but EURES still does not cover all such areas , which is regrettable . #% Is the Council likely to invest a little more at this time in terms of presence on the ground in Cambodia ? #% As Mr Duquesne implied in his contribution , if the recent happenings have shown us anything , it is that we can not turn a blind eye to events around the world and hope that they will go away . #% They are sentient creatures . #% The imposition of a board of directors of the Council would steal the Commission 's right of initiative and destroy its critical role in identifying and expressing the common interests of all the Member States . #% Nor , it seems , does the EPP believe that ethnic minorities should be encouraged to vote . #% CCCTB is one of those proposals . #% Instead of giving away their hard-earned money to the money-changers at airports or ports , they will keep more of their holiday money to spend after window-shopping , made easier by the transparency of costs . #% I am pleased to say that Mr Parodi successfully managed to further clarify and enhance the Commission proposal , removing uncertainties and simplifying the text . #% We believe that it is simply wrong to suggest that the only answer to such a dire situation in our fish stocks is simply to up anchor and go and repeat the exercise in someone else 's waters . #% Rather , we support effective national policies and strong inter-governmental co-operation to stamp out this evil trade . #% For example , in pursuing our shared goals for security , we should seek the maximum cooperation to avoid unnecessary difficulty . #% In that episode , and in this one , Mr Schulz will say ` something must be done ' and , like the Grand old Duke of York , he marches his ten thousand men up the hill , only to get a phone call from Gerhard Schröder and march them back down again ! #% 
Or is he wanting to say to us that he understands that other people , including in the United Kingdom , are now having to take unilateral action because of a series of decisions that have not been made despite what we understood , at the Agriculture Council last July and subsequently , was to be a particular course of action ? #% We can not retreat from that position , we must accept that the negotiations at Kyoto are simply the first step . #% The fact is that the European Union could add between two and six per cent to its productivity if its regulatory framework was matched by the best in the world . #% But , help is at hand ! #% There is also a need for improved coordination to reinforce the EU position , particularly in the international fora where these are discussed at global level and , indeed , for the markets as well . #% I want to encourage the Commissioner -- who , I hope , will leave something in place as part of her legacy as five years as Commissioner -- to start to encourage Member States to exchange practice , firstly , about how they are going to establish their competent authorities or , indeed , how they are going to allocate responsibilities to existing environmental agencies that many of them have already established ; and to establish the sort of networks of sharing of best practice that we are seeing in a number of other pan-European regulatory environments , such as energy and communications . #% The Commission must have some relationship with the Council , and I would hope for a more satisfactory response . #% Firstly , will the EPP-ED Group support the amendment adopted in committee to make sure that nuclear decommissioning funds can not be used as a cross-subsidy for electricity operators ? #% Well they have brought in the Agency Workers ' Directive in 2008 and this has been like pouring glue into the most flexible part of the labour market . #% Our institutional decision-making processes are complex and lacking in democracy , and our economic policy strategy is divided and ineffective . #% We must have equality , not just within the European Union , but also for products coming into the European Union . #% What are we actually about here ? #% The French version simply refers to `` les autorités compétentes '' , whereas the English version refers to `` the competent devolved authorities '' which , in English , has a more significant meaning . #% For some developing countries , tourism accounts for something like 50 % of GDP , so we should be aware of that . #% There was some suggestion in the Committee that perhaps this report did not formally change the position but simply reordered and clarified it . #% They would , in effect , have meant the elimination of many electronic devices which are used in the home , as well as taking a major stand against electricity pylons and the industry as a whole . #% 83 % said that they know a little , or even very little . #% I also believe that the greatest form of job security any individual can have is in the skill set they can develop , and that is where our priorities should lie . #% This is something we also wish to see as a result of this work . #% Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I can say we will be supporting this compromise text on the situation in Burundi . #% The Fourth Directive made great strides in dealing with these problems . #% It means separate markets in new issues , higher regulatory costs , higher costs of capital for business and less choice for investors . #% I think it is very sad indeed that we have not seen similar progress in the road sector . #% If too many high-level politicians are sued it may begin to look like a witch-hunt . #% This Parliament must support his efforts with Swedish NGOs behind the scenes to promote the peace process for all parties involved that was started in Costa Rica . #% I agree with the general rapporteur ' s comment that the cuts to Structural Fund appropriations are completely unacceptable . #% We need a holistic approach that meets our international obligations and the needs of those we aim to protect . #% Those crucial commercial services - such as banks , home-shopping services , access to transport - being able to order transport and look at timetables - need to be made accessible to disabled users . #% This compromise seeks to deal with those practical problems , and reduce any damage that may occur to liquidity , by exempting the small banks and focusing on systematic internalisers , and by reducing counter-party risk . #% Also , while I acknowledge that proposals are evolving all the time , it seems to me that as a coordinating body for best practice , there is a danger of duplicating the efforts of other coordinating bodies and thereby failing to make a sufficiently positive contribution . #% Secondly , does he realise that the perpetrators of this scam said on British television that they have foolproof ways of disguising the fact that protein not of the origin advertised could be added to the product ? #% We in the European Parliament should send a message to the US -- not simply to the government but to its people -- that whether it is the Human Rights Council , whether it is Kyoto , whether it is the International Criminal Court , or whether it is the principle of multilateralism itself , the United States is deeply and dangerously isolated in this world and it is no role for the world 's last remaining superpower to play . #% Yet what is missing from this report is any indication of why the Commission failed so manifestly in its duty . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Berès on her report , which is very comprehensive and a good piece of work . #% The Socialist Group has proposed two amendments to plenary . #% Lastly , we believe that this particular amendment is not incompatible with financing other areas , and will not affect existing funding -- the amendment itself mentions this . #% We must have a global crackdown on this illegal trade . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , firstly , I would like to express my thanks , and the thanks of the S&D Group , to Mr Cancian , for his hard work on what was indeed a very difficult and very complicated dossier . #% I am disappointed in the EPP . #% Mr President , do I understand it that you are therefore not able to confirm what I asked ? #% I used to represent Parliament on that committee , and there were officials from Parliament too . #% President , Commissioner , we are faced with a fundamental difficulty , in the exercise in which we are involved , in maintaining the balance between enlarging the EU and reforming the institutions to make that enlargement possible . #% In October 2004 , EUR 230 per tonne was suggested , but that was too low for ACP and too high for dollar countries . #% Its simple aim is to cut pollution and improve the air we breathe , which circulates from one country to another without respect to national boundaries . #% Therefore , we tabled an amendment , which draws attention to these aspects of the proposal and calls for them to be borne in mind by the Member States when they draw up the guidelines for action . #% The report will be available under Annex III of the framework agreement procedure when it is ready . #% As a parliament , we should be working towards assisting women to have a choice in what they do . #% On the Committee on Petitions , above all other committees , I believe we have to put aside our national and party political obligations and allegiances in order to deliver natural justice for the citizens who approach us . #% There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab . #% I quite agree with President Prodi that it is vital to extend the scope of qualified-majority voting as far as we can if the Council is in the future to be able to enjoy the capacity to take decisions . #% Even then , we can go back to the usual procedures if only two groups or 32 Members make such a request . #% It therefore goes against not only the spirit but the very letter of your Constitution . #% This problem , I believe , can only be solved satisfactorily at EU-level . #% Mercifully the UK is still online to meet its Kyoto commitments . #% We will have done our work in terms of contributing ideas and proposals to the Convention and that in itself is very important . #% First , our fisheries activity at international level , and in particular any agreements reached directly with third countries , must be made compatible with our development policy . #% Secretary of State Rice pointedly said last week that the US has respected the sovereignty of other countries . #% Let us make sure that it remains on track for accession in 2007 . #% I hope its principles will be of use to local authorities in my region of North-East England . #% All over Europe the funding of political parties is tainted by sleaze which is bad for democratic politics . #% If something can not be saved , we have the responses to it . #% We agree with his comments . #% Is there information available on how they do that ? #% The better the product , the more the maker should welcome this directive . #% Now it has imploded again . #% Therefore facing these extraordinary difficulties , the one thing at Barcelona that would move us forward immensely would be to provide the framework , the joint commitment and a realistic appraisal of the resources required to ensure that we make these fundamental leaps to promote education as the fundamental step in the future of the competitive knowledge economy in Europe . #% 
Just to move forward on some of the issues related to opening up the market . #% They saved up to pay for private education , not in a steel and glass tower , but usually a simple room above a shop . #% If we do , the next debt crisis will not be in a country , but will be a debt crisis of the European Central Bank itself . #% I thank the Commissioner for her consideration . #% I would like to see the full implementation of both programmes and it is for this reason I voted in favour of this motion . #% I have heard traditional values referred to . #% In conclusion , I would like to say on behalf of all my colleagues in the Internal Market Committee , that we are really interested in consumer policy . #% So even if the volume of world trade has increased 17-fold , what use is that unless it benefits poor people and promotes sustainable development ? #% I take this , however , from a slightly different tack . #% Sir Tom Blundell , Chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution , said that , given our understanding of the way chemicals interact with the environment , you could say we are running a gigantic experiment with humans and other living things as the subject . #% Mr President , I wish to know whether I am allowed to make an explanation of vote . #% Equally , on the balancing side , consumers expect that their existing rights to be able make private copies , to be able to use library facilities , to be able , if they are disadvantaged , if they are blind or disabled , to have access to new forms of media will be safeguarded . #% However , it is Part 3 which contains the common policies that have so greatly disappointed public opinion in France and the Netherlands and in several other places , notably as regards social and economic policy and the issue of borders . #% We are now participating in the next important landmark in that process - seeing what was a convention become a Community act , a regulation , in one fell swoop bringing a previous area of private international law into Community law and more importantly into the internal market . #% On the Lisbon Process , I am delighted that the single market and the need for regulatory impact assessments is now back on the agenda . #% As to lectures in human rights , we all - regardless of our record - need to be lectured on human rights . #% Seattle must close those loopholes , again on the basis of transparency and greater certainty about the rights and obligations of all those involved in the dispute settlement system . #% we can not accept the incorrect interpretations of the Geneva Convention or the excessive criticism of US actions in its handling of prisoners at Guantanamo when rights of all those held in custody will be respected ; #% Otherwise , I commend to you Mr van Velzen 's work and the compromise for which my group will happily vote . #% The golden prize which is ours for the taking is a dynamic single European market , quickened by the introduction of the single currency . #% However , what we have here is not cooperation but coercion from the Council . #% Furthermore , we do not believe that an immediate closure of Guantanamo Bay is desirable or feasible while the war on terrorism remains a priority for both the United States and the European Union . #% This is a very important step in the reform of the Commission and I am pleased to give it , on behalf of my group , our full support . #% Mr Blair says he wants progress on this . #% His crime , according to the Burmese authorities , was to enter the country and attempt to draw attention to the human rights abuses taking place there . #% Let us remember that neither Bulgaria nor Romania form part of future enlargement rounds ; they are part of the previous enlargement . #% It is very easy to be brave about third countries ; it is much more difficult to be brave , in some respects , about your own , and I think that is a shame . #% Our Group supports this compromise amendment with , however , the exception of one word : `` plus '' - `` plus proportionnelle '' . #% That must be our approach . #% I would add my great thanks to Mrs Grossetête with whom I have worked extremely closely on this particular issue . #% I am very pleased to hear that much progress has already been made following the publication of the single market scoreboard . #% Thirdly , there have been no prosecutions for breaches of animal welfare legislation nor was any environmental harm identified by the Environmental Agency . #% We are proud to be friends of Indonesia , but we can only be friends of a country that genuinely strives for justice , reconciliation , peace , security and the trust of its own people . #% I support the Saudi peace plan , but it is a shocking comment that it has taken nearly 53 years for some Arab states to come forward with a plan which actually recognises the State of Israel . #% That is not going to be delivered by 96 separate proposals , but by your Commission working together to tackle that . #% That would increase Europe 's competitiveness and would also result in a revival of the European job market . #% On this basis I support the report and the agreement . #% There can be no justification for the continuation of the illegal French ban on British beef if it is clearly labelled . #% The UK nuclear regulatory system is largely non-prescriptive . #% I know I speak not only for the whole of my delegation but also for the whole European Parliament , because Phillip 's fair-minded and judicious approach to politics won him friends throughout this Chamber . #% Another issue is : are we covered by insurance should someone who contracts lung cancer try to make a case ? #% Mr President , the new presidency can be assured that hundreds and thousands of British citizens will fight the proposed European Constitution tooth and nail , and millions of us will vote against it when the time comes ! #% Although I signed the joint motion as instructed by my political group , I intend to vote against this resolution . #% They were endlessly kind in what was a most difficult week . #% Indeed , in the negotiations on accession by Norway , which came to naught because of the referendum decision , this was an important consideration . #% I use the term ` the reindeer syndrome ' , which many colleagues will have heard me say before . #% I trust that this simplification and modernisation of the much-amended regulation in the past will provide a useful and very constructive framework in a further enlarged European Union . #% It is a global market and European companies are at the very forefront . #% It is a very serious situation and one in which the Council ought to have taken a much closer interest . #% Madam President , once again it is a genuine pleasure to be working with my friend Mr Miller . #% I commend that to the House . #% Clearly it is also important for the solution found to this not to result in a multiplication of regulation and for CEIOPS to take that into account in any forthcoming protocols . #% We need to see some shift of resources during the course of this year . #% Clearly the changing industry of financial services lends itself very well to the new technologies which have emerged and continue to emerge across the world . #% Some time in the future , and it is still not clear when , bilateral investment treaties will fall under the Commission . #% That is why I would urge more help for countries outside the European Union to stop this disease coming in . #% Mr President , this is a proposal which will amend three directives , namely the directive on coordination of credit institutions , the directive on the solvency ratio for credit institutions and the directive on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions . #% The text of the Convention involved a bit of give and take . #% But - and I would ask Commissioner Kinnock to take this on board - should we not also exercise control over the competence and qualifications of the crews that sail those particular ships ? #% in writing . - The ECR wholeheartedly supports a free and plural media across the European Union and stresses the importance of freedom of information for all European citizens . #% Mr President , I am a somewhat unexpected rapporteur for this report . #% Mr President , it must be very difficult for the Commissioner to come here with a brief that he may not know quite as much about as some of the speakers . #% The European Union should have taken a similar view . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for her opening comments on the general aims of the Commission 's proposals . #% Mr President , when it comes to the environment , aviation always seems to me to be the easiest target to blame for emissions . #% The most significant thing you could do today , Mr Lamfalussy , in your closing remarks to us as President of the EMI , is to send a very strong signal to the finance ministers and the heads of government in Amsterdam for them to recognize the pressure from the citizens for us to have an EMU , but an EMU in which there is public confidence and that will create jobs . #% 
There is , however , one fatal flaw in this Parliament 's approach to the whole question of universal suffrage . #% At GBP 9 000 each , this is a considerable amount of money and I request that you draw this matter to the attention of the Greek presidency and ask it to take urgent action to redress this regrettable state of affairs , which is causing hardship to the plane-spotters and to their families . #% This is an area where it is important that we make progress , as is the question of the various penalties which courts can impose . #% Therefore , it is urgent that we have authorised and authenticated systems of information for patients . #% But what do we achieve in doing this ? #% Those same objectives are shared by hundreds of civil society groups across the European Union , and many thousands of individuals care so much about those issues that they will travel to Genoa to take part in peaceful demonstrations to draw the world 's attention to the need for urgent action on these issues . #% If it does come off , if we are successful , then once again we can show that if we have good interinstitutional cooperation , we can find the solutions that we all look for in a variety of areas . #% You have a 100 % record for being wrong with every single prediction about the euro and you say today that this package will put Greece on the road to growth , but no it wo n't . #% The reasons why divisions have opened up are largely to do with insistence by existing Member States on a slavish allegiance to Washington , or an equally stubborn hostility to everything that emanates from the United States . #% The costs are nothing compared to the costs of not enlarging and are nothing compared to the costs of trying to maintain the stability of the continent by other means . #% The notion that those acting with humanitarian intentions should be immune from prosecution is very problematic and certainly subjective . #% I wish to concentrate mainly on the culture report . #% I find the Commission 's dose of sugar market reforms much sweeter to swallow . #% We can assure them that we will ensure that no European legislation hampers their activities . #% That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process . #% It is certainly an odd expression to use in this context . #% I thank the Commission for accepting what we had to say . #% I hope that everyone outside will be pleased with the work that has been done . #% In these circumstances , sanctions on development aid , but not on humanitarian aid , will have to be maintained . #% I hope we manage to get a very positive vote from Parliament tomorrow . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Mulder on his report , primarily because within this 2004 discharge he continues the momentum that we created in the 2003 discharge about national declarations . #% Whilst all our minds seem to be concentrated on Berlin , and quite rightly so , the present meeting of the Agricultural Council is a considerable distraction . #% There was an agreement in the rail sector that the provisions of the working time directive would apply in that sector so long as there was parallel progress in other transport sectors , particularly the road sector . #% Why not drop barriers against the Third World in return for domestic , legal and infrastructural progress ? #% Likewise , no disbursement of funds has been made under programmes such as Urban , Interreg or Leader in the year in question . #% You may be aware of a number of petitions concerning Lloyd 's of London , as well as complaints to the European Commission . #% I wonder sometimes what he is even talking about . #% It has to stop now . #% I hope the Commissioner , when he responds , will take account of these issues in the general debate on industry . #% I supported it in the Committee because I felt that we needed to make this point : there is exasperation where sometimes - and the Commission I think accepts this as the case - applications have not been considered not just within three or four months , as the Commission would have preferred , but within five months and beyond . #% The economic impact is seen to be modest , and the numbers started slowing towards the end of last year . #% The terrorists seek to stir wider hatred and animosity and undermine not only the secular democracy , which has been part of our legacy to India and India 's great strength and example , but also the hopeful signs of rapprochement , which have been seen recently between India and Pakistan . #% Also , in larger companies risk is taken seriously because health and safety is regarded as a productive and profitable element for the future of any company structure . #% So I and many of my colleagues will be backing most of Mr Blokland 's amendments because we want the highest possible standards . #% Perhaps it is because both the other institutions are not used to Parliament having codecision in this particular area - I am sorry , but you will have to get used to it ! #% Under the present version of Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 , documents may only be classified in order to safeguard the essential interests protected under Article 4 ( 1 ) . #% We need a new framework agreement so that the Member States also pay more serious attention to their obligations under the EU Treaties . #% Hearing the G8 communiqué on climate change being called ambitious stretches the English language almost to breaking point . #% However , if accession were suddenly to disappear off the horizon , that decision by the Lithuanian Government and Parliament could well rebound on them and we could find accession moving further away and not closer . #% How are these diseases getting in ? #% We in the European Parliament should support him in his role . #% There must be some additional cost between the dates that the new Member States wanted and the dates the Commission is proposing . #% I voted against the Mastorakis report in committee , not because it was a bad report but because there were references I felt we could not ignore . #% It is not just the United Nations institutions , it is also the Bretton Woods Institutions which , at a time of financial dislocation and global environmental challenge , all require a consistent policy to be developed so that they interact better with each other . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , this oral question is not about the guilt or innocence of Mr Assange in the rape accusations against him in Sweden . #% However , I do not agree that Iran has a ` right to enrich uranium ' , which is allowed under IAEA rules but , given the continuing impasse over negotiations , is contrary to UN Security Council resolutions . #% Therefore I do hope that you use objective scientific evidence when it comes to food safety , and not just a precautionary principle , which is understood under Article 30 ( ex-Article 36 ) . #% We are often told that it is already a positive option , and that many people want to be temporary agency workers . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I support this Treaty change and my group supports it , because we want to see stability within the eurozone . #% While we recognise that the Commission needs a certain discretion as to if and when it opens an infringement procedure , the discretion has to be used in compliance with the Commission 's obligations to ensure that Community law is implemented and applied . #% The continued spending of money in that way is unacceptable . #% I would like to examine why this is happening , what the concerns are and what we should do about it . #% That is why my group will be abstaining in tomorrow 's vote . #% Since 1981 we have regulated new chemicals , but that covers only some 3 000 substances out of the 100 000 in existence and it has taken 40 different regulations and directives to do that . #% It is more a question of nine minutes , perhaps nine hours if it is difficult , locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects , not nine months . #% We must not allow that timetable to be eroded . #% Around the Mediterranean the three monotheistic religions - Judaism , Christianity , Islam - were founded and fostered and spread throughout the known world . #% Of course I understand Israel 's nervousness about taking the first steps . #% Yet it is only by coherent European action that we can confront the threats and seize the opportunities of globalisation . #% It has been an issue of compromise all the way through . #% What was expected to be a fiscal straight-jacket , fully inspired by irrational fears of fiscal irresponsibility rather than rational economic thinking , turned into a more reasonable , albeit still partly unsatisfactory instrument , to respond to a legitimate need for budgetary discipline amongst Member States in a forthcoming monetary union . #% But as everyone else has said , it has to be in exceptional circumstances . #% There are institutional lessons to be learnt as well as those that relate to the Year of Tourism itself . #% Our contention is that EU development cooperation should be based on the same principles of partnership , subsidiarity and decentralization which we have put at the heart of the way we organize ourselves within the European Union and which , we therefore argue , must inform our relations with the developing world . #% I am keen to encourage both of those aspects , but overall this report is extremely worthwhile . #% This has to be introduced in a reasonable way , in a way which is acceptable to everybody . #% 
How soon does he think the 350 000 ceiling on beef taken into intervention will be passed and how far does he expect it to go ? #% Many small retailers are self-employed . #% I want to congratulate the rapporteur - once again - for coming forward with a measure which has significant benefits for consumers in the European Union . #% Mr President , I should like to draw your attention to the continuing deterioration of the situation in Zimbabwe . #% But this is a very specific statement . #% In many instances in the United Kingdom , Ireland and one or two other countries , qualified people dispense minor medicines - in particular , products such as worming pills and flea powders . #% This legislation , if it signals the end of just one elaborate box , fancy bottle or something wrapped in plastic and sold in a heavyweight bag , will have done its job . #% I should also like to thank Mrs Corbey for her report . #% It was an onerous task , but one which I was prepared to undertake whilst I had the powers to do it . #% This is an important cross-border capital market issue and we need greater coherence and communication between the various operators within that market . #% These issues need to be addressed in a rigorous and systematic manner in economic planning , employment policies , the development of pension schemes , education and training initiatives and community care provision . #% Over the last few weeks , and literally single-handed , he has achieved -- that was a pun ! -- quite incredible results with the Council . #% Or perhaps it is truer that we have had to make way for the vote of censure today and therefore legislative business comes second in this regard . #% In preparation for enlargement , we all have a responsibility to engage with our electorates to ensure that they welcome enlargement and recognise the benefits rather than worry about the costs . #% But we must now face up to the reality that cod stocks are low and that the families and communities involved in the fishing industry who need support should receive it . #% However , we have also looked to signal where there are problems and seek solutions where possible within the regulation 's limited scope . #% What the authors of these regulations have clearly failed to recognise , however , is that many small and medium-sized livestock and poultry farmers and many family businesses also formulate feeds . #% So it is a pleasure to acknowledge that not every environmental problem is beyond resolution and that , in some instances as least , we are capable of turning the tide . #% This may even be shared with third-party countries , including those of such outstanding democratic credentials as Albania , Peru and the Russian Federation . #% At least at first hearing what you appear to be proposing on Latvia , Slovakia and Lithuania seems an intelligent and pragmatic formulation and you should be congratulated on that . #% I would hope there would be no request for changes with the Swansea or the Scottish submissions . #% It truly is an absolute farce but nobody here dares to admit it because you are all in denial . #% For example , horses are not eaten in the United Kingdom . #% Therefore it is reasonable to call for other professionals to identify their clients properly and report suspicious transactions without narrowing too much the scope of the relevant activities . #% Madam President , as I have declared it to other people already I thought it was only fair to declare it to this House that I will be abstaining because of pecuniary interests . #% Since 29 March , 81 , 648 cattle have been slaughtered under the Government 's scheme of carcass disposal . #% That is what officials are employed to do . #% But our rapporteur wants to go one small step further and I feel , as others have already said , that we should support him . #% The Green Paper states that the fragmentation of rules has prevented the smooth functioning of the internal market . #% To get it right will require work and effort and a commitment : As Mr Van Orden said , we want to make certain that we are saying and doing the same things in six months ' time as we profess to do now . #% Since I did not wish the Motion to be voted at all , it seemed that my most logical course of action would be to abstain on the vote . #% Therefore he clearly poses a global threat to oil supplies , and , were he to become a nuclear power , could hold the whole world to ransom . #% But of this , only EUR 7 million is currently budgeted through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights . #% But repeatedly they all say the same thing : it is corruption that discourages them , investment conditions are very poor because there is no viable long-term tax system , laws are constantly changing , the infrastructure is poor and , most importantly , property rights , including intellectual property rights , are weak and confused . #% I hope that we will come back to this in the future . #% Mr President , in response to Mr Alavanos 's first question , I am informed that the report from the expert committee that is being convened under the Euratom Treaty will be published within weeks rather than months , so it is in the relatively near future . #% It is right that within a developing area of freedom , security and justice Member States ought to begin laying the foundations for establishing trust in each other 's legal systems . #% That is why I support the roadmap for peace , for a two-state solution in Israel and in Palestine , for a democratic Palestine alongside the State of Israel . #% For the Commission to respond to a written question of mine on 29 November 2002 simply by saying this type of technology needs to be used with caution is not good enough . #% All of us have a common enemy in fighting international Islamist terrorism . #% I welcome the strong controls we have to ban certain ships from European Union waters if they have a poor detention record . #% I want to be reassured that if the EU signs the convention , that position will not change . #% We may have to do this eventually but not yet . #% Two other points I must make , because this is an essential question central to reform . #% I support the Figueiredo report , which calls for a re-evaluation of the EU 's commitments to fighting poverty and social exclusion and for the inclusion of challenging but achievable and clear objectives in the Europe 2020 Agenda . #% This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable . #% EU crew members suffer a severe competitive disadvantage ; with their working conditions of working one week on , one week off with full pay on passenger ferries , they find it very difficult to compete with non-EU crew members working nine months on , and one month off without pay . #% Unless we can try to intervene as the European Union in the global economy , then the Russian situation will not improve . #% I speak on behalf of myself and my 28 colleagues from the British Labour Party . #% A quarter of the population live in other countries . #% We have had intense discussions with the Commission and what is before you today is a result of those contacts . #% However , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism recognise that the best people to deal with this problem are indeed the trade unions and the airline operators and , in a spirit of compromise , have agreed to give all sides until 1 May 2001 to reach an agreement that will form the text of a new Subpart Q. #% I speak on behalf of the British Labour Members on that major area of dissent . #% Although the original Commission proposal contains much of value , we have concerns about certain aspects . #% Now that is not a tactic for putting off indefinitely the start of a new round . #% We have proposed setting up an interparliamentary body between members of the NATO Assembly and our Foreign Affairs Committee . #% I should also like to thank my colleagues in the European Parliament who stood together through this process , with the difficult challenges we faced , but which we overcame together . #% I have examined very closely the current guidelines for the applicants for Daphne funding . #% I have just got time for one question : if low pathogen avian flu is also infectious and can mutate , how can we be certain that the import of infected wildfowl and domestic poultry is really under control ? #% 110 MPs have signed in support of the vigil , plus 58 peers and and 27 MEPs . #% That is the one aspect in this old debate that has been missing since we voted on the discharge in this Chamber . #% European companies must also make certain that they do not exploit the cheap labour and do not continually perpetuate the working environment in factories , where the women suffer and work very long hours for very little money . #% I think that is a mistake . #% These requirements about working time prevent professionals from doing their job efficiently by imposing strict terms on when breaks have to be taken . #% The EU Solidarity Fund allows us to act as a community to alleviate misery and suffering . #% Mr Barroso , do not withdraw the directive : make it better . #% 
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Because the financial crisis was a credit crisis and a banking crisis that took place and emanated from the large commercial banks - the Royal Bank of Scotland , IKB , Fortis and the like - do you accept that the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive , as well as being highly damaging to the UK , is a misdirected and misguided regulatory initiative on the part of the Commission that aims entirely at the wrong target ? #% I am not willing to equate the crimes of the Nazis , the Holocaust and the genocide that saw six million Jews , along with Communists , Trade Unionists and disabled die , with those of Stalinist Russia . #% Mr President , I agree with what Mr Helmer has just said , which I am sure is a surprise to everyone . #% Now it is up to the Council . #% But this is important if we are to have a genuine achievable outcome from this Lisbon Summit rather than perhaps setting off down another road - a road which I know Prime Minister Gutíerrez does not want to embark on , because he actually wants to see something achieved in the process of the Lisbon Summit . #% You will be aware , Commissioner , that the three directives that make up the first railway package were adopted in 2001 , with a deadline of March 2006 for their transposition into national law . #% My constituents deserve better . #% For instance , the Technical Group , the TDI Group , which did not table any amendments at committee stage whatsoever , has now arrived in plenary with between 20 and 30 amendments , many of which are contradictory . #% As a regular item on our committee agenda , we have now decided to focus on budget scrutiny and , at each discussion , we invite the Commission and the Council to participate with us in a thorough review of expenditure within the structural fund area . #% Given that the mechanical force-feeding of ducks and geese does exactly that , will the Commission please state whether it is satisfied with the application of Directive 98/58/EC in France and Belgium in particular ? #% Yes , I totally agree : let us set challenging targets , but let us not confuse targets with compliance . #% This larger bus needs a stronger motor if we are not to slow down , and one that enables us to cross the difficult hills that lie on our path . #% Therefore we do not need your convergence either and we do not need harmonization . #% This exercise brought into some disrepute the precautionary principle . #% We would be very interested to know whether , when the Commissioner responds to this debate , he would be able to outline the types of situations that he envisages this may be used for - although , of course , we have some ideas ourselves . #% The Ottawa Convention places an obligation to destroy stocks of APL . #% I would like to highlight one or two points that the Committee on Legal Affairs considered in relation to our work on the universal services and users ' rights directive . #% It was seven months ago that we last had a plenary discussion on this topic and it is very alarming to realise that no progress has been made since then . #% The Charter must bind the Commission , the Council , Parliament and the Committee of the Regions , but should it be a ` central reference point for the European Court of Justice and national courts ' ? #% Even though I would have liked to have seen the directive go further , it is still a very good directive and will save asbestos workers ' lives across the EU . #% I am grateful to the honourable Member and I will happily send to him and to Mr Collins , who I know has a longstanding interest in this matter , the full statements that were originally provided to Parliament , but I am sure the figures will be of interest . #% They are tabled by different members within that group taking different positions and therefore can not possibly be a group position . #% Mr President , Zimbabwe is a land of tragedy and a land of tyranny . #% ( Laughter ) It is nice to see him blush . #% Effective and environmentally sensitive infrastructure development is , therefore , not only a development of merit by itself , it also has additional benefit for economies and societies and the Union as a whole when it is international and genuinely transEuropean . #% One last word on Amendment No 29 : we need to draw a distinction between unsafe practices between men and any sexual practices between men . #% There has been respect on both sides for the fact that we are the two arms of the budgetary authority . #% He has denied everything that every Member of this House , right across the political spectrum , has said . #% My final suggestion is that for us the acronym SLIM - `` Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market '' - should represent `` Substantially Less Interference by Members '' . #% For this reason I totally support , on behalf of our group , Mr Giansily 's resolution calling for the reinstatement of the 11 % levy . #% We must not allow countries that have been very forward in their reform process - that have gone through a very painful process - to be held back by countries that have been more half-hearted in their approach to this process . #% Will he exercise his responsibilities under the Treaty of European Union ? #% I welcome , however , calls for the EU to become more democratic , transparent and efficient , for an enhanced role for the national parliamentarians and a menu of options to choose from in 2004 . #% If not , please stop this nonsense now . #% To save time I am going to assume that the respiratory and other health problems associated with ozone are understood , and that every Member of this House will want to reduce them . #% There are also worrying reports of increased incidents of racially motivated harassment and hostility , especially since 11 September . #% It is indeed regrettable that the nine most significant European Parliament amendments were not incorporated into the Council 's common position . #% Organised crime crosses frontiers in Europe very easily and we need to work together as Member States and as European institutions to fight against it . #% I listened with great interest to the Commissioner 's introduction , and I heard a lot about more research but nothing about calling for a moratorium . #% If anti-dumping duties are ultimately rejected by the Council of Ministers , is there any question of compensation for those companies who have been adversely affected ? #% Then DG Environment confirmed that there had been no withdrawal , but that there was to be an orientation debate . #% Is it yet again the intention of the Commission to raid the development budget to cover the cost of these accompanying measures for the ACP ? #% Yes , indeed there is , and long may it remain so . #% The response by the security forces is not the cause but the consequence of the problem . #% Anwar Ibrahim should be released immediately if Mahathir 's failing Malaysia is to be restored to health and prosperity in the eyes of the watching world community . #% Secondly , on the question of staff , here too Parliament has been able to provide a way of sensibly dealing with that process , rather than what might have been an immediate surge - as the Council wanted - of productivity gains but maybe not achieving very much . #% That is why some of us seek an Amendment No 56 to allow adjustments in this area on the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee rather than requiring fresh legislation to implement them . #% This is still an objective which is achievable , even if the current economic climate damages the true potential . #% In response to some of the points that she has made I would say , first of all , that European-wide standards that can be enforced are absolutely necessary to regulate what is , in truth , a European-wide business in many cases . #% Could the Portuguese Presidency confirm that sufficient work has been done to ensure that agreement can be reached in December ? #% Brazilian expansion would also be at the cost of thousands of acres of rainforest and savannah that contain precious biodiversity and wild life . #% The UN Secretary-General has rightly said that the Burundians must experience an improvement in their living conditions if this peace process is not to be jeopardised . #% Mr President , it goes without saying that I congratulate both rapporteurs on two reports that have support across the House . #% But above all , let us not go overboard in sounding alarmist about this . #% I think the past is now the past . #% If the Council can not be there , I suggest we withdraw that item and the discussion of assent to the Treaty from the agenda until the Council can be present . #% Some 50 million people in the European Union are suffering social exclusion and poverty . #% The rising nostalgia for the Soviet Union and Stalin is also very worrying . #% I very much regret that the EN Group - which I believe officially stands for the Europe of Nations Group but should really stand for Eurosceptic Nutcases - takes this particular view . #% And , finally , I apologise to you and colleagues for not staying for the rest of the debate but , as ever , there are double bookings going on in this House . #% Secondly , I would like to mention Amendment No 5 which Mrs Dybkjær has already discussed briefly , that is , the use of beeswax as a preservative for surface treatment of peaches and pineapples . #% It must also be said that bushmeat provides a major source of protein . #% Of course , it is now important for Bulgaria to concentrate on the period after accession . #% I am pleased at the efforts that have been made by Dublin and Bilbao to limit duplication and minimize conflict between the agency in Dublin and the one in Bilbao . #% I and a number of my colleagues on this side of the House feel that keeping the five distinct levels of professional qualification and the definition of them is important . #% Certainly , it appears that the Member States do not do a very good job because we learn from the proposal for a decision that ` in recent years , Member States have not seen the need to carry out evaluations on the spot concerning judicial cooperation in criminal matters and drugs . #% 
My colleagues and I on the Committee on Petitions can not agree to the petition being closed until we get the proper answers to these questions tabled now and also previously by my former colleague Roy Perry . #% After Mr Farage spoke , the question of French law was invoked . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for that interesting reply . #% We need to spend more time on it together to work through the details . #% Ten years ago coffee-producing countries received around one-third of every dollar spent on coffee . #% We also took the view that sex and sexual orientation should be taken into account when looking at the definition of a social group . #% The calls made in this House are not anti-American . #% This is the European Year of Equal Opportunities in a Union which prides itself on its commitment to human rights . #% The bulk of these are individual cases of incorrect application of Community law by the Member States ' authorities . #% In conclusion , I call on all democratic Members of this Parliament to support this report and to have the courage to support full human rights in the European Union as we enter the new century . #% I hope that in future the EU will ensure that there is no doubt about Kosovo 's compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law . #% In Aung San Suu Kyi 's view , the poor people of Burma are suffering enough already and economic sanctions would just hasten the day when we could see the return to democratic , accountable government . #% I am no Thatcherite -- never have been -- and I am not a Eurosceptic , but I think -- some consider this to be an eccentric point of view -- that we should deal with the world as it is and not the world as we would like it to be . #% The licence also contains a micro-chip and it is this that has caused the greatest debate among the Members . #% In the elections some 60 % of the electorate preferred to vote for parties that were not represented in the previous parliament . #% I shall spend a couple of minutes talking about why this is so important . #% We have shifted from being a talking shop to a co-legislature . #% I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for that reply , but is it not a fact that our trust in American civil liberties guarantees is being severely shaken and that it is a tragedy that in the United States , under the Bush administration , standards of fairness and due process are being sacrificed ? #% We do not need any more monitoring of the problem : we are in danger of going down as the only species that monitors its own extinction instead of taking steps to prevent it . #% That is not to say we should ignore the areas which have been outlined by Commissioner van den Broek and Mr McMillanScott . #% Will the west again repeat this mistake ? #% One interesting activity which is of particular value is the support of the Information Society Forum , consisting of web-based experts and looking at challenges facing the development of the information society and , of course , the normal programme of targeted conferences , seminars and workshops . #% Mr President , I welcome many aspects of the Commission programme but I am disappointed that there is not more reference to disabled people or elderly people . #% British Conservatives can not , therefore , support this report . #% I wish to conclude by thanking the Committee on Employment for accepting one of my amendments which states : ` Member States shall transpose these provisions in a manner consistent with promoting job creation and making temporary agency work more attractive , recognising the different circumstances pertaining to their own territory ' . #% One of the great mysteries in your proposals on the revision is where the money will come from after 2003 . #% Secondly , why were the OAU and other international observers not allowed into the north of the country ? #% They are technical amendments , which will give legal clarification to the original text . #% Kazakhstan must not slip on its road . #% No such rights apply in the case of audio-visual performers . #% For example , we could be using the structural funds . #% Madam President , I had the deepest misgivings about allowing an unreformed Hamas to run candidates for the Palestinian elections . #% I wish to say to the President-in-Office at this point : our group has put a lot of effort into getting a commitment and an agreement on this strategy . #% However , much of what is being achieved could be thrown into reverse if a negative decision is taken in December . #% What was also buried in Izmit was some of the enmity between Greece and Turkey . #% We are at serious risk of having to move at the very slowest pace of the slowest Member , unless we can bring the House together at every opportunity . #% The other side of the coin is that in Europe we have an ageing population and we have declining birth rates . #% However , like Mrs Theorin , I disagree with paragraphs 15 and 19 , on the integration of the WEU in the EU and more majority voting in the common foreign and security policy . #% The Commission 's proposal applies a `` one size fits all '' framework designed for large equity issues to the diverse range of European financial markets . #% One of the things we agreed in the committee was that active inclusion should not be replacing social inclusion , that wider field of feeling that you have a role to play in society . #% It is very simple : in 1973 , we were worried about the deterioration of corpses during transit . #% This was attributed by many observers to liberalisation , privatisation , deregulation , etc. encouraging an inflow of capital . #% It is not acceptable to do this two part-sessions running . #% It is reported in today 's that the publicly funded European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is poised to support the highly controversial Sakhalin II project . #% With regard to vehicle air conditioning -- and it is one side-effect of global warming that more people have air conditioning in their cars -- the proposal was to replace HFC134a , with a global warming potential of 1300 , with the more environmentally benign HFC152a , with a global warming potential of 140 . #% Taxpayers across the EU have a right to expect politicians to spend wisely and given the recent referendum results , it is clear that many in Europe and not just in Britain share concerns that vast quantities of their money are being spent on major projects of which they do not seem to know enough . #% As the vote is now likely to be held tomorrow , I urge the PSE Group to have a new exchange of views on this so that I can fulfil my task as rapporteur and ensure that they have the fullest and most up-to-date information . #% I always feel a certain schizophrenia when working on these matters on the Schengen projects because I am a British MEP , but it obviously would be a good thing both for the European Union and for the Western Balkan region if the UK were to follow suit as quickly as possible . #% The ECOFIN Council is acting with extreme arrogance if it believes it can simply disregard growth and employment in the European Union . #% Mr President , first can I congratulate Malcolm Harbour , the rapporteur , on his own-initiative report on the Next Generation Internet : the need for an EU research initiative . #% I have criticised the repression of peaceful Tibetan culture , the persecution of Falun Gong , as well as other religious minorities , and the presence of widespread censorship in China , including the media and also the internet and Google . #% Food Safety is of great concern to the majority of the European Union 's citizens and it is therefore vital that this Authority will be efficient , democratic and transparent once it is fixed . #% An essential element of this more flexible approach is that spectrum should be made available without conditions being attached as to the service to be provided or the technology to be used . #% We will be asking for a number of split votes , largely in those areas which contain rather provocative phrases about social dumping and about the chase to the bottom of the social scale , implying that some Members States are deliberately undercutting others by reducing social protection . #% Moreover , crucially , aviation 's total impact on the climate is estimated to be two to four times the CO2 impact , even without considering the potential effects of cirrus cloud enhancement . #% I want to put to one side the debate that we are having on the legal basis and talk about the very important issue of employee participation , which should be to the fore for us in the European Parliament tonight . #% The time for political posturing is over : it is now time for action . #% I look forward to working with the Commission to try and find a solution to this problem with my committee , and to hearing the views of the other Members . #% Public security is of paramount concern , but the Presidency must acknowledge that undue restrictions on the liberty of our citizens simply fulfil the ultimate goal of these extremists . #% It would be far better to achieve a simple formula , say 55/55 , which dispenses with the need for a third key . #% I would say to Parliament this afternoon that the money spent on petitions and the EUR 3 million that we make available to the Office of the Ombudsman is money that is extremely well spent . #% The drafting of the Charter will certainly be informed by the application of that principle , but it is crucial that the Charter reflects modern European society with all its pluralism and with all its diversity . #% How much longer are we going to put up with this ridiculous system ? #% Women 's rights give increasing cause for concern , they are not improving , they are becoming worse . #% Madam President , it is a great pleasure to rise in support of Mr Ford 's report . #% I have here a copy of a letter from Mr Rasmussen , the Prime Minister of Denmark , stating that he supports a change in the rules of procedure . #% 
All feed businesses , including farms , would need to fulfil a new requirement of having financial guarantees in place to cover the cost of withdrawn products in the event of a feed safety incident . #% We have to make sure that the schools can deliver them and I am quite sure that what is contained in this report is one of the ways that we can help raise the standards in schools . #% There were problems too with the fact that the postal votes , which were sent directly to the army in the Congo on Thursday , miraculously returned on Saturday , all in due form going into many marginal constituencies . #% As I understand it , the proposal on animal transport that you have recently published will force the UK to lift that derogation and allow the export of hundreds , if not thousands , of horses and ponies for slaughter to France , Belgium and Italy . #% I certainly hope the Commission will play its part in persuading the Council not to undermine the possibilities we have here to make that kind of contribution in South Africa . #% What is happening off the coast of Africa is much more than exploitation of waters . #% This is not a blank cheque for health tourism ; it is the establishment of current UK rights for its citizens . #% It is clear that these elections did not conform to OSCE standards for free and fair elections which are part of the commitments entered into with the signing of the partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Kazakhstan . #% I also welcome the fact that we are very clear now that this is not about tax harmonisation in any way , but about administrative systems . #% However , I can not entirely support all the amendments tabled by some of my colleagues . #% IT is properly addressed in the report . #% The opposite , an ` Opt-In ' regime for Europe , would be entirely ineffective . #% Our government in particular seems well capable of making its own mess of our transport policy without any help from the Commission and its jargon . #% I would emphasise , too , that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to `` responsibilise '' - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , the resolution talks about the Wolfowitz affair in terms of ` the World Bank 's failure to live up to the globally shared standards of transparency and democracy ' . #% That is why I , as PSE spokesperson this afternoon , speak in support of the Commission 's proposal and the Sterckx report on the need to establish a monitoring system for maritime traffic . #% It is important that we be seen to ensure that the reform is on track , and that means these issues being dealt with much further in advance than we are now once again seeing . #% He will learn the same lesson as Mrs Thatcher did , namely that the European Union is unreformable . #% As we have seen before , these gaps have in some cases actually got wider over time , so we need to make sure that over time they begin to close . #% Obliging EU states to allow asylum seekers to work after six months , if their claim is not decided , is very important : they would retain dignity and also pay tax . #% We can not take a decision until we have all the information available as to implementation . #% At the very worst we could see the European Union begin to crumble to the deafening sounds of mutual recriminations and contradictory ambitions , as well as endless disputes about obscure matters of European law . #% It is not written on tablets of stone that global politics and global policies should be about ` them ' and ` us ' and about the survival of the fittest in an unequal world , as President Mbeki said when opening the summit in Johannesburg . #% Although imperfect and always capable of reform , these agencies have provided good service and have relieved much suffering . #% We needed an interim solution that meant that Europe 's savers and investors did not have to wait still longer before the completion of the single market in financial services , which was first launched in 1973 . #% We would be putting motor vehicle accident victims in a class apart . #% Furthermore , as there is rightly widespread opposition to its introduction , emphasising its necessity is a dangerous diversion from tackling the real problems at hand . #% There should indeed be equal pay for equal work , and to help those parents who wish to stay at home and look after children we should lessen the tax burden on the parents who work , as indeed we should lessen the tax burden on all who wish to work . #% The problem is how to do it . #% Nothing , I repeat , excuses terrorist acts , but Tony Blair must wake up to the fact that his actions make him culpable . #% The Commission is wrong to insist stubbornly on its position , given that only two out of the three potential tachograph suppliers are able to test pre-production models at the moment and are not able to go into full production . #% Despite the vociferous objections of the industry , with 8 000 products already on the market , with the shop shelves heaving with deodorants and shampoos , make-up and hair gels etc. , it hardly seems likely that a great many people are going to lose out if a marketing ban is introduced . #% Mr President , I just want to thank everybody , because , as I said at the beginning , this was a unique event . #% He has moved substantially in the right direction but I am concerned , in the example he gave , about the ability of a dealer to Holland to go and invest and set up a dealership in the UK . #% Involving foreign experts in the process of quality assurance would help us in very many ways to ensure that educational levels and provision in one country are accepted in another . #% At least this time it was good to do business with the Belgians , as it was last time when I was general rapporteur for the 1994 budget . #% Whilst I express my support , one thing still puzzles me . #% Finally , I would like to say that , whilst we have every sympathy with Japan , future trade policies simply can not be based on who has had the most recent natural disaster . #% But of course it is human nature not to opt in to get them . #% But it does stretch our credulity even at this time of the year . #% There are people who are neither flesh nor fowl , neither purely assistants nor people who could be regarded as third parties and lobbyists . #% We shall vote the money and we shall look forward to the reports from the Commission on how it has spent the money . #% I was astonished by his opening political statement . #% Britain and Ireland joined the European Union at the same time , yet the Irish constitution at that time had a claim over British territory . #% Hopefully , Parliament can play its part and unravel last night 's decision and continue on the track of getting a speedy process going so we can get the whole issue sorted out , not just for the Commission but for all the institutions . #% The first is the re-arrest of Mordechai Vanunu in Israel . #% In our enthusiasm we sometimes forget what a sensitive subject the harmonisation of private law is ; it touches the national legal traditions in our Member States , legal traditions born of our differing histories and cultures of separate nations and jurisdictions . #% Even if the European Commission uses its best efforts in the United Kingdom there is no guarantee that the scrooge-like United Kingdom Chancellor will find matching funding . #% While we should all welcome proposals to increase extensive farming , we must ensure that we can police the system simply and efficiently . #% I wonder whether we feel today that all the institutions of the EU have done enough to let the small bird sing . #% We have required within our report that European nation states should have action plans for dealing with the abuses which take place . #% Mr President , as a regular Member of the ` Friday morning club ' of which you are the President , I would crave your indulgence . #% The conciliation result represents a substantial compromise . #% In specific response to the honourable Member 's question , Articles 12 and 17 of the current Staff Regulations do not prevent members of staff from reporting wrong-doing within the Commission and it is consequently not the case that officials have to breach the regulations in order to properly report suspicions or concerns . #% This was regarded in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as being excessively bureaucratic . #% If you continue to ignore the democratic voice of countries like France , the Netherlands and Ireland , then you will turn the European Union back into that very Union that you fought so hard against . #% This has been a fascinating debate today which has been very interesting . #% Even Professor Prodi declined to face an open hearing . #% Two weeks ago I was part of Parliament 's delegation to Japan . #% We are going to continue to ensure that there are additional requirements upon dangerous or hazardous waste disposal because it poses risks over and above that posed by municipal waste in terms of handling and other controls . #% Kyrgyzstan was annexed by Russia in 1864 , but it achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 . #% We should acknowledge quite properly that the Commission has made considerable advances , in particular through DG XIV , in the last six months . #% Therefore , we have decided not to support this resolution . #% Mr President , I had hoped to catch your eye a bit earlier because this concerns next week 's agenda , but I hope you will agree to take the point now . #% My concern , in terms of policy and responsibilities , is that the Commission has failed to use the annual economic report as a stimulus for action and as an input into the broad economic guidelines . #% It will not be the last . #% 
The Liberal and Green groups have tabled an amendment calling for the clear prospect for membership to be opened up . #% A consequence is that that the losing nations do not have that skill space that they need to educate their young people and develop their own economies . #% In the record it still shows that we voted against and I am asking if it could be corrected . #% By taking this parallel approach it demonstrated that reform of the tobacco market and the promotion of public health must be seen together . #% It seems logical to use the revenue collected as the basis for determining the actual percentage deficit . #% We must be clear that we are ready at literally 24 hours ' notice to carry out the threats that NATO has made to bomb Yugoslavia if it is not prepared to reach appropriate conclusions in the negotiations . #% I do not think this has been the most distinguished evening in the history of Parliament . #% In the UK , there are proposals for executive decisions for detention without trial and an attempt to avoid any significant degree of judicial review . #% I can not overstate the importance of that , particularly because we want those computer scientists to develop the tools , products , services and new ideas that will help their communities , whether it is in health , education or other forms of local service provision , particularly over a very widespread area and one where communications are very light . #% It will set up a network intended to respond effectively and in a coordinated fashion to epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases in a Community without internal frontiers . #% The first theme is the first concerted attempt to accommodate the needs and legitimate complaints of developing countries . #% They claim that most of the actions which we request in this resolution have already been carried out and that the remainder are , in fact , under way . #% Furthermore , the idea that Member States may retain an unspecified amount of their subsidies linked to production flies in the face of the recent CAP reform and would allow less efficient producers to maintain overall production at an unsustainable level . #% I am not sure that Austrian farmers would like that to happen . #% While accepting that some Member States may wish to engage in the practice , I would submit that it should not be compulsory . #% This will make comparison of retail goods in shops easier and consequently , increase competition . #% Why have we had so many twists and turns by the Bush administration , redefining torture so that it does not cover waterboarding , prolonged shackling or induced hypothermia ? #% You might rightly ask what a person like Chihuri is doing as a vice-president of Interpol in the first place , but that is a different question . #% Has the United Kingdom met all the conditions that were laid down in that agreement ? #% Mr Nicholson mentioned feathers . #% However , consumers ' enthusiasm for green goods has yet to be matched by industry . #% Sometimes commentators do not see the wood for the trees - two countries in particular have been singled out for fevered attention on the sole question of the viability of their public debt to GDP ratios . #% Mr President , I thank Commissioner Fischler for affording us this opportunity to discuss a very important issue . #% It should perhaps have been the central question at Hampton Court . #% I myself think that Mr Le Pen has a number of factual and legal arguments which no doubt he will wish to deploy before the German court . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner to use his great personal authority as well as that of the Commission to encourage Finland to maintain this issue as a very high point on its agenda in its forthcoming Presidency and to report back at the end of its Presidency on the progress it has made so that it can inspire others to follow its example . #% If we overload this directive with prescriptive detail , with centralising details , it will not reflect the diversity of pension arrangements across the EU and , again , we will not have people taking up the opportunities provided by the directive . #% The compromise resolution , which we shall be voting on later today , is therefore unsatisfactory in some respects , but that is an inevitable part of having a compromise . #% This report essentially confirms the practice we have built up , but it brings in three small innovations . #% It has been effectively put on quarter-time since November 2001 . #% Corrupt and brutal governments in failed states are usually the main source of human rights abuse of millions of the world 's most disadvantaged people . #% We need to pay more attention to it as a European Union and , if necessary , we offer the European Union 's services as a mediator if that would be helpful to those involved . #% I say to them : I give you the support of my group in the quest to keep a European civil aviation industry alive . #% Mr President , I note that in his opening remarks , replying to Mr Barón Crespo 's oral question , the Commissioner asked for Parliament 's suggestions about future activity and future developments . #% The issue is not just about employment in sugar , as the Commissioner must know -- because we made enough fuss about it in Europe -- but also about the other developments that depend on and grow around that source of employment . #% Like everybody else I regret the US position , but I have some questions for the Council on the Commission . #% This is a key area for the European Parliament to be involved in . #% How do we define less controversial ? #% Sometimes you boost trust through action , and sometimes by non-action . #% I would suggest that the way forward for the Commission is for Vice-President Marín , to show a little humility and to accept the recommendations contained in Mr Fabra Vallés ' excellent report . #% Although clearly we all wish the project well , it has frankly confounded many pessimists including our former Prime Minister John Major . #% We should all accept that these problems are not the fault of the Presidency . #% Both extensions to the Commission 's proposal require deeper analysis of better regulation principles and the cost and impact of existing business . #% In terms of counter-terrorism that expertise does not rest within the EU as such . #% I have a question for the Commission regarding the compromise talks about a review of the use of phthalates in medical devices . #% I have also watched with concern in the past year the tendency of the present leaders of Russia - many of whom are ex-KGB because they were appointed by a former colonel in the KGB - to be a little bit trigger-happy in the arrest of so-called British , American and Russian spies . #% I also question whether it would be possible to scrutinise the application of the Working Time Directive in this directive , given that most of the records would be held back at base and not in the lorry concerned . #% We have seen many hours wasted in conciliation committees arguing over this one issue whereas the legislation of substance could have been settled easily and earlier . #% We need to cut carbon emissions quickly and as cheaply as possible . #% It is about what you do when you get the warnings . #% When Commissioner Patten made his proposals , he made the point that this was the figure he would be taking to Madrid for the donors ' conference . #% These independently minded people have been subject to very unpleasant threats and bullying . #% The European Parliament held a hearing just a few weeks ago with representatives from the Minister 's country as well as from my own . #% Mr President , this legislation on the labelling of beef has two distinct aspects . #% Perhaps this was a failing on our part to take some kind of initiative . #% We have done the technical work but we have not yet sold the message to the public . #% I hope this time around real attempts will be made to protect this unique remnant of the world 's deep time . #% Our words about justice are never matched by our deeds . #% If we are democrats and believe this Parliament has meaning , then we should allow debate to flourish . #% Firstly , a general remark . #% Nobody could say that he is acting in a flamboyant or extravagant way . #% In Finland , for instance , registration tax for new vehicles is over EUR 700 , in Portugal it is over EUR 2 000 and in the UK we do not have a registration tax at all . #% How much longer will it go on requesting and reminding before some action is taken by somebody ? #% Vanunu can not damage Israeli security . #% I say that because of what the Council 's attitude has always been towards this . #% I do not think we will find that there is a single negative vote in the two Groups against the amendments . #% 
Amendments Nos 45 and 46 concern the rights of individuals . #% I saw recently the mass grave in Rwanda of up to half a million people bludgeoned to death by physical weapons , called machetes : just a single weapon in the hand of one man killing person after person . #% I also understand the Presidency is making great strides , or trying to make great strides , in introducing transparency to the Council and I would hope Mr Alexander could tell us what progress he has made on that . #% In order to avoid ending up in the European Court of Justice , my government has had to recruit large numbers of EU vets , 300 of whom come from Spain . #% There were at least 40,000 casualties and we extend our deepest sympathy and the hand of support to Turkey at this tragic time . #% The suffering of the refugees on the Tampa should at least lead all the governments that we represent here to rethink the way that they implement the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome the Commission proposal . #% If the same thing happened in some of our national capitals , there would be no prospect of terrorists being convicted . #% in writing . - The ECR Group acknowledges that the fundamental principle of equality between men and women is enshrined in the European Treaties and is something that each Member State of the EU respects and upholds . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate the Council for doing that . #% Where there are no forests , then we can grow willows and miscanthus to make sure that we can produce energy supply . #% I voted for this report as it backs the reform process , but I will not support any calls to weaken the proposals adopted by Basel . #% Request for waiver of Mr Ribeiro e Castro 's immunity #% The Medina report and its follow-up have shown that the European Parliament can take an appropriate initiative by itself in this matter . #% We have to avoid the unreasonable fears that seem to be floating around in some people 's minds . #% This perhaps is the greatest challenge we face as a Community . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the Pakistani people do not deserve military dictatorship , violence and lawlessness . #% Others will not . #% It is not just an immigration question , it is also a question of recognition as a family . #% Thirdly , disputes of a variety of kinds , including litigation , have added at least several months - indeed we can probably start counting in years - to the renovation . #% If Parliament were to refuse discharge , it would then have to debate separately what the consequences should be if the Commission itself did not draw any consequences . #% It is appropriate to permit government state aid for employment schemes in restricted circumstances , but the real way to tackle the 18 million unemployed in Europe , to give people genuine job opportunities , is by labour market reform , by producing structural and economic reform and labour market flexibility , making it easier to hire people . #% I can only hope that the rest of the debate and the report are more accurate than Mrs McKenna . #% Had that been a deduction made in London and a net sum paid over , the argument would never have arisen . #% Firstly , there must be a coherent strategy for the European Union in the years ahead so that we know what the Union 's priorities are to be , both internally and externally . #% We need a clear picture of the other measures that are planned towards this end and how they will combine to bring it about . #% I come to this particular case of Mr Bangemann . #% Its case should not be tied to the progress in other neighbouring states in the western Balkans . #% The United States ' opposition to the Court is totally irrational . #% Some Members may vote against it when the time comes , but they will probably come from amongst those who tend to put the interests of industry before those of the environment . #% I ask him to take one last step towards us . #% Is it complacency ? #% All the honourable Members , including Mr Pomés Ruiz and Mr Dell ` Alba and others who have enquiries of that kind can , simply by referring to that table , get the most up-to-date information available to any one in the European Union , including the Commission itself . #% Does it not agree that this action runs absolutely counter to the principle of mutual respect and good faith between these institutions in the legislative process , as set out in the Treaties and endorsed by the Court of Justice ? #% Mr President , I would like to welcome what is a very well considered report , which invites us to stand back and take stock before embarking on further legislation in this field - a refreshing welcome from the tendency of this House sometimes to rush , or to be pushed to rush , at complex legislation . #% We can therefore be sure that EU accession negotiations will be very lengthy , and I for one fully support the Eurlings report . #% I hope that in 1999 we can use our new Treaty powers to put the fight against exclusion where it deserves to be - right at the heart of Community policy . #% I will take it up in the UK and hope that you will pursue it here . #% Again , that is an area we have not sought to change . #% Finally , we need an open society where people are free to travel to find work . #% Logically , therefore , the agency should have its operational base there , although in arguing for that option , everyone will , I am sure , bear in mind the very persuasive points that Mr Cohn-Bendit made in today 's debate about previous experience . #% I can not say that I was entirely happy about the way every part of this procedure went . #% To me the big issue , though , is implementation . #% It appears to me that , under the present rules , central government can build the EU contribution to structural funding into its calculations for determining regional government budgets . #% We were happy with the compromise that Article 192 represented , but if this compromise is felt not to be working , and if it is not seen to be satisfactory from Parliament 's point of view , there will inevitably be pressure for the Treaty to be amended to give Parliament a full right of initiative , something the Commission does not want because it sets great store by its monopoly of the right of initiative . #% The second point I wanted to raise has to do with what you identify in your White Paper - and I agree with this entirely - about the real challenges for any service organisation which is decentralising and delegating responsibilities to reporting managers , empowering them to take decisions and to have that all-important control of budget . #% Mr President , the evidence of a sinister spider 's web of CIA torture flights crisscrossing Europe is overwhelming . #% That could still happen , but , for now , compromise and leadership is necessary -- the kind which the more advanced developing countries will have to accept if they are to receive any benefit from the current round . #% This lack of honesty detracted from the conference . #% Therefore , I hope that the Committee of Experts when it meets during the course of the next few weeks and when it conducts its detailed investigations into the operation of the Commission , will look in some detail at the structural problems within the Commission . #% Our role is surely to help our society equip itself and adapt to meet that challenge much more strongly . #% I declare with pride a personal interest in this , because I began my career in the car industry 32 years ago working at that factory . #% In most parts of the world the percentage of fins that can be landed by fishing is lower . #% With nearly thirty Member States we need a clause on flexible cooperation that is actually workable . #% There is broad consensus that under-financing and under-investment , in Africa in particular , have played a significant part in holding developing countries back . #% It is quite clear that we need to have a European defence identity and , therefore , the St Malo initiative must be followed up rapidly . #% Finally , I would draw attention to what we have done in terms of demanding greater emphasis , in road services , on reducing noise . #% So , on the whole , I welcome the common position and the fact that it looks as if we are going to be able to achieve an agreement and get the programme extended . #% The formulation of the common position would have simply allowed the employers to walk away from attempts to reach negotiation on annualisation of working time and Member States could then have allowed annualisation . #% And it is vital to support the growth of a knowledge-based economy in Europe . #% The votes today are quite sensible and straightforward . #% in writing . - Recent years have shown how our economies are interdependent , and the problems that can be caused by lack of legislation regulation or cohesion of economies across Europe . #% I will be urging my group to reject Amendment No 34 here because it still implies that noise limits should be introduced . #% Not just the Channel Tunnel , but other issues as well , will be resolved by such processes . #% The economic partnership agreements are very complex and complicated for the ACP and are the most complex and complicated negotiations they have ever engaged in . #% What we have here is the potential for increased return on savings without increased risk . #% 
All too often , it seems , it is those at the top , those with ultimate responsibility , who escape justice . #% This time for island people . #% Now a minimum of 10 000 families face the prospect of suffering job losses . #% When I asked the question it was about an appeal . #% The Petitions Committee often offers the citizen a way of cutting through the bureaucracy of Europe to address issues affecting their lives . #% We will not want to remove the ban from refrigerators , where there are certain medical uses which are essential . #% Thirdly , core labour standards are universal . #% The study will also take into account the need to draw up an olive oil quality strategy in order to add more value to the product . #% My country , Mr President , and yours - if I can call Scotland my country too , as I certainly would - have suffered the horrors of BSE . #% I for one would also be quite happy to look at whether annualisation of working time could be made a more realistic option in all Member States . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I would like to thank Mrs Stihler for her hard work . #% It has been raised in my own group whether the trade unions - the workers ' representatives here - were consulted and informed in this important process . #% My problem is that if we add another layer of bureaucracy for the pub and club industry like this , we will cause tremendous problems . #% I believe that is important and something which has been strenuously resisted over the years by the wine lobby . #% The European Union is in an ideal position to take that action . #% The essential clause in the Copenhagen criteria is that we should take account of the absorptive capacity of the European Union in order to welcome countries as they would like to be welcomed and as we have welcomed the ten Central and Eastern European countries today . #% Finally , I should like to refer to Amendment No 1 which stands in the name of my group . #% I just hope that everybody that voted Conservative in eastern England - especially those that are about to lose their jobs - knows what you and your party have done in this place . #% There are members of the Committee on Budgets here now . #% They want a reformed Union , a more accountable , transparent , democratic Union which delivers value for money in those areas in which it has delegated responsibility , a Europe closer and more relevant to the people . #% I also met Mr Kinnock this morning to discuss yesterday 's responses . #% A number of other junior employees of independent television are being arrested and interrogated as we sit here now . #% This report emphasises the importance of Hong Kong to the European Union and indeed to the global economic system , as we have seen in the last few weeks . #% The talking has to stop . #% The Exchequer will receive less tax revenue , not more , and economic damage will be done to local communities . #% We can no longer sit on the sidelines tut-tutting when faced with dangerous , repressive regimes prepared to murder their own people , threaten regional security and nurture terrorism . #% So we must be determined to maintain the deadlines . #% Could you try to get the services to do something about the state of the lifts in this building ? #% Mr President , I too congratulate the High Representative , Mr Solana , and Commissioner Patten for their untiring work . #% That would be unacceptable . #% My country sees no problem in sending the Roma back to their countries of origin . #% However , we believe that it is absolutely necessary to monitor these devices and the Committee on the Environment 's amendments have attempted to set out precisely why and how . #% Could I ask that we check the audio or video tapes of that voting procedure to establish the actual position ? #% In the Minutes , there is a ` list of shame ' of those people who voted against the Ghilardotti report . #% His controversial trial followed with accusations internationally of political manipulation of the judicial system . #% The problem is that we are living in an Alice in Wonderland world . #% Success equals jobs and on a day when thousands of workers demonstrated outside our Parliament their rightful demand for jobs , this is a positive way to redress the balance and the answer to their demands . #% I am pleased to see that the Commission is looking to use the structural funds to help deal with the social implications of this dreadful development . #% I would ask the President-in-Office whether he can confirm that , if Member States do not honour the undertakings that have been secured , he will continue the practice of naming and shaming those Member States that do not comply with the laws they have freely adopted . #% That will help many consumers and worry none . #% Will this be framed , for example , along the lines of the Swedish Government 's or the British Government 's rules on whistle-blowing ? #% In this Parliament , whether we are dealing with the buses and coaches directive , the lift directive or all the issues concerned with the information society , we have to fight and fight to get the Commission to consider disabled people 's interest and to consult with disabled people at the outset of legislation . #% Whereas money supply , of course , is of very direct interest to any central bank , there is in this case no direct inference that it will have the effect that everyone suggests it will have , i.e. that e-money will be anything other than a means of exchange , a redeemable voucher if you like or a mechanism expected to be involved in trade . #% And yet for some reason , society tolerates a similar toll of people being killed and many , many more being injured on our roads . #% There is also the matter of barriers and , obviously , a city requires a barrier-free environment . #% That is due to the chivalry of my colleague , Mr Koukiadis , who is here tonight and who is the original draftsman of the opinion . #% That is true for us in the European Union also , and it must be true further afield - particularly as regards our development cooperation policies - as the ACP-EU parliamentary assembly passed a groundbreaking resolution last year . #% I am certain that he would not , as a responsible Member of the European Parliament , want to contest serious scientific opinion or indeed be alarmist in a way that would be upsetting to his constituents . #% Madam President , I am very pleased to say that all three UKIP MEPs have joined together with 20 other Members of this House . #% I welcome the limited promises made by the Commissioner this afternoon as regards seeking the extension of the `` Everything but Arms '' initiative worldwide , and also by the Spanish Presidency on the Tobin tax and other potential new sources of public finance for development . #% Rather it seems to me that , as has already been mentioned by a number of other speakers , there has been a series of real conundrums - serious issues - at the heart of this proposal . #% France , a traditional friend of the Arab world , is leading this resistance in the Council , with Belgian , Swedish , Irish and Spanish backing . #% For a long time we will pay a huge cost for this while certain capitalist countries will earn huge profits . #% That is the bottom line . #% The treatment of the indigenous minorities , particularly in the Central Highlands and in the north is unacceptable by any international standards , even if one allows for their negative role in the national liberation struggle in Vietnam in decades past . #% If it is determined exclusively by choice of destination , we risk ultimately undermining its integrity . #% What is the point of any of it ? #% Finally , I welcome the proposal to call a European Conference in London next February , where all applicant countries can come and discuss matters of concern to all Europeans , including the common foreign and security policy , justice and home affairs . #% All those things mean that we do not have to accept this terrible toll among women . #% My group believes that the report as it stands , while not perfect , is at least balanced , realistic , objective and addresses the issues that it is supposed to address , namely the transportation of radioactive material . #% One of the keys to mobilising this type of risk-taking is to move towards such full employment that people feel they can take that personal risk . #% The text before us meets many of Parliament 's demands at first and second reading . #% Too many animals are transported in cramped conditions , without adequate food and water , without opportunities to turn round , to get out , to exercise on their journeys . #% Azerbaijan spends countless petro-dollars trying to convince outsiders of the benign nature of the regime but I , for one , am not fully taken in . #% Neither of them actually mentioned the fact that we have had the postponement of the nineteenth round which was due to take place this week . #% Lord Tomlinson and I , the joint rapporteurs on transit fraud , are happy that the Commission has progressed sufficiently on the matter of computerisation . #% 
Amendment No 22 by Mr Ferber would introduce new conditions , notably a 50 % tax so negative and complex as to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the Commission 's proposals . #% I also echo the comments made about the money being totally inadequate . #% The truth is that the history of foreign exchange is a history of gross misalignments , of overvaluations and undervaluations , each inflicting either depressive pain or inflationary costs on the economy and , as Greece has rightly recognised , the euro is a way of regaining control over a key part of our economic environment . #% For some time , the Commission has recognised the link between capital flight and corruption and criminality in Russia and we also understand the cumulative threat these conditions pose to the country ' s transition to a democratic system and a market economy governed by the rule of law . #% It is important that we have a human rights dialogue and I welcome the fact that on 13 June that dialogue is going to take place . #% We have made no impact on the unemployment situation . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , it was with great pleasure that I voted for this report , and I wish Mrs Dahl well on her maternity leave . #% Far better for them to have the wherewithal to deal with development priorities . #% Madam President , yesterday 's Minutes in the English also seem to indicate that they were the Minutes of Thursday 17 December . #% It is time to say that the threats might change , but that human rights are inviolable . #% I know there are different views on this issue but it seems to me that without an indicative vote the key element of whether Members feel the candidate Commissioner is competent or not can not be determined exactly . #% In China , business runs with a light regulatory touch . #% I want to come to the issue which Mr Davies has addressed , namely , where we should start from . #% Western intelligence alleges that Iran is using a network of front companies to try and buy components for missile and bomb production from western Europe and to hire impoverished nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union . #% The European Union has also established the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to , amongst other things , ` defend Europe against bioterrorism ' . #% I hope the Commission will take note of what Parliament has said because where the Commission can be criticised in its upgrade is that it is too tentative on these vital issues . #% We have found also some uncertainty among the citizens about the Charter 's scope as a solemnly proclaimed instrument . #% Well , they are here , sitting in the rather remote European Parliament . #% In particular , it seems to me difficult to try to decriminalise the facilitation of illegal immigration for some groups rather than others . #% If we listen to those arguments , we would do almost nothing in this Parliament . #% Military strikes by US forces , apart from other objections , are no substitute for constructive policy and , whatever they are effecting in Washington , in many respects they are counterproductive in the area . #% How can we tackle unemployment if we do not create the conditions for internal demand , in particular at a time when external demand from Asia may be significantly reduced . #% Chechnya is his black mark - we must be critical of the Russian government here . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , since the start of the economic and social crisis , over seven million people have joined the unemployment lines in Europe . #% Beyond that , of course , it is a matter for the Chinese to resolve . #% This is a global problem and it needs a global solution . #% The Russians are trying to extradite Ahmed Zakayev , the envoy of the Chechen president . #% That is why I am here , having shadowed it in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy . #% We have overcome those problems to a large degree and last year Indian-owned businesses contributed 5 billion to the British economy . #% We can not run reconstruction from the top down as if it were a military campaign . #% We expect a report from the Commission on this subject by 30 April 2003 . #% There is still an outstanding need to satisfy the West that the status of the regulator in Ukraine , and in some other eastern European countries , is equivalent to western practice : it certainly should be established before K2 is finally commissioned . #% That is why they must all be consulted on the establishment of further guidelines . #% It is quite clear that you have identified the situation and are taking some action . #% In response to the question as to what the Council 's position on EU kerosene tax was , I was told that because it had not received a proposal from the Commission , the Council could not take position . #% No wonder London is widely dubbed ` Londonistan ' . #% Mr President , the Mediterranean is the cradle of European civilisation . #% I have seen hundreds of thousands of fish dumped in the North Sea . #% This was initially distributed , but on 9 March I received a letter from President Cox stating that in his view it was inadmissible and he was therefore withdrawing it from circulation . #% However , we need to ensure that when the detailed proposals are set out on the rules of origin , which allow countries to industrialise without the scheme being too far-reaching , we also look at the way in which countries apply them . #% Madam President , this interesting idea simply takes up in oral form the compromise amendment that has just been rejected . #% What we need is time . #% The final savings arising from these conditions can only be quantified precisely when the established location of all Commission offices in Brussels is clear . #% Secondly , it is very sad that civil society was not able to have a greater input into the meeting . #% I have therefore put forward a compromise amendment in the name of my group which should give satisfaction to both sides - both those who think that transnational lists are important because they are more European , and those who say you do not need a system like that , and that even federal-type systems do not normally have federal level lists . #% However , we believe unequal treatment should be caught if it only pretends to be based on religion or nationality but is , in fact , race discrimination pure and simple . #% The Iranians immediately pledged to resume commercial-scale enrichment of uranium , which can be used either as a fuel for power plants or , as they really wish , in the core of an atom bomb . #% Could you comment briefly on the implications for the agenda this evening . #% The Bank of England was granted operational independence in May 1997 in one of the first acts of the incoming Labour Government . #% But I say to the Commissioner and to everyone else in this Chamber : let us move next to the statute on associations , so that non-governmental and voluntary organisations can enjoy legal status too . #% On the issue of making contraceptives more widely available we voted against the amendment because we believe these are issues of personal morality and conscience and not an issue where the European Union should be making a political stand . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , we in the ECR Group want to see more effective control of the EU budget . #% Dagmar Roth-Behrendt intended to move one of the two amendments tonight . #% Thirdly , they should ensure that managers are responsible for their staff , are given the support that they need and are evaluated on their achievements . #% My own view is that it is a very fine difference and , indeed , to say that we want to hold the European Central Bank to account is generally acceptable to the majority of people in this House . #% But it has vital implications for people 's feeling of financial security . #% Noting , though , the visit of Richard Armitage , the US Deputy Secretary of State , to that area , I would like to call on you to urge the institutions of the Union to become involved in this process too , just as we are in the Middle East through the quartet - perhaps we can invent something of a similar kind for Kashmir . #% What is happening in those countries and why is that occurring ? #% We need to see the glass is half full and be optimistic , although I regret that the Council is , worryingly , only promising to consider , not to legislate on , Euro-bail , which would have helped Andrew Symeou , who has been explicitly refused bail because he is a foreigner . #% Currently , the UK receives receipts per capita that are probably the lowest in the EU , receiving less , in terms of infrastructure and agricultural subsidies , than states such as France and Italy . #% We did not want to have reports both from the Members and from third parties . #% If we do not create an attractive framework , this directive will be a dead letter because no one will use it . #% You can remind Members who feel that they can not vote in favour of or against a particular proposal that we do have in fact a third button on our voting machine that they can press , namely the abstention button . #% Mr President , the challenge confronting us is how Europe can do more for crisis prevention and management , and the proposals which we are debating are the only way we can achieve that more effectively . #% As the rapporteur for this Parliament on the original resolution four years ago , I can not but comment that this represents a failure of political commitment in Europe to aiding five million refugees , some of the poorest of the poor , in Asia and in Latin America . #% I would like to look at the very wide definition of catering waste in the annexes and in Amendments 22 to 25 . #% 
The Court 's latest report is another litany of the failings of European Commission bureaucracy . #% Controlling the media is a mammoth task and Europe needs to draw on as many expert sources as possible in order to harness what is increasingly a harmful influence on children . #% Will you live up to your treaty , or is it just empty words ? #% We have a Committee on Petitions that addresses a thousand petitions a year . #% This is made plain repeatedly in the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , that were in turn inspired by the opinion of the Committee on Employment . #% Will we be offering similar support for that work , which has to go hand in hand with the work that will need to take place on conflict resolution and peace-building ? #% It is clear that the international community is no longer prepared to see internal armed struggle as only a problem for the state concerned and that long-term political investment and negotiations are necessary rather than arms sales . #% Currently , if European citizens wish to go and buy a new car in another country , they have to get special insurance cover for the period when they pick up the car from the dealership or the factory and bring it back to their own home country . #% Universal service is also important because it is one of the very few ways in which the European Union institutions can exercise some real control over this hugely profitable sector of industry . #% However , if , as we all believe , prevention is what we are after -- rather than clearing up damage afterwards -- we need to start action straight away and there is no excuse for delaying on that . #% The main emphasis that Mr Tamino has quite properly laid in his report , which is entirely endorsed by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , is that the precautionary principle must apply . #% And yet he is going to be paid a salary that is bigger than Obama 's , which tells you all you need to know about this European political class and how they look after themselves . #% We should reject this budget . #% With our association agreements - Egypt and Israel spring to mind - if we do nothing , we condone human rights abuses . #% Others have mentioned that this might be a step forward , but it still does not take us to where we want to be . #% Greater involvement of civil society will also be key . #% Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already referred to the fact that what is happening with the Channel Tunnel is counterproductive to the policy which we all want to see pursued , namely that of getting freight on to the railways and off the roads . #% I also note that the people of Wales have been among those to benefit from funding following the terrible floods of 2007 . #% We therefore accepted that any additions that we required , particularly in relation to the further demands of enlargement , would be met by the Commission , as is only fair . #% I know he will be listening carefully to the Commissioner when he sums up to see if he will put on record that promise to ensure that a future proposal for a multiannual regulation comes forward and that the annual reports will be provided . #% Second , in relation to Romania , where there was a slight hesitancy in his language , to what extent does Romania 's previous track record , where it promised a lot and delivered little , count against it despite the progress that has been made in the last two or three years ? #% The report produced takes careful note of the recommendations made last year by my esteemed colleague Mrs Frutos Gama and the resolution passed by the European Parliament . #% I do not think there is anybody in this House who has opposed this particular kind of concept , which is involved in identifying those lines where we know from the different reports available to us that the policies are being implemented poorly , either quantitatively or qualitatively . #% At present there are a lot of people dealing with complaints , problems and issues . #% Secondly , I feel there is a calm acceptance in this Report that the EU must run an intelligence system as part of the CFSP . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commission statement and I am pleased to see we are becoming more avant garde , emerging from the dark age of accounting that the Commission presently inhabits . #% ` Inadequate ' is not a satisfactory term . #% Twenty five per cent of urban Africans have no piped water whatsoever . #% The basic problem is that the US has no data protection laws . #% Appealing labels on beef or lamb indicate these are grass-fed but does that mean throughout their lives , or for just part ? #% As an MEP who has been an MP in the UK , I now realise how little my colleagues and I knew about the regulations coming from Europe . #% Mr Barón Crespo is right : the British Conservatives do not mourn the demise of the European Union constitutional project and we give thanks for Spanish and Polish intransigence . #% We also of course have to consider Amendment No 26 , in the name of some of our German colleagues , which rejects the common position . #% It is true that there is more to be done and there always will be more to be done , but within moments they will be here beside us and they will be full members . #% The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome . #% Let us hope that this report , together with the employment directive , will address that issue . #% I always supported Ukraine 's EU-membership aspirations . #% It is therefore essential that we progress the agenda for ensuring high minimum procedural standards of justice for persons accused in criminal proceedings which the Commission will be putting forward in a proposed framework decision next year . #% We must insist on urgent implementation of this Community assistance . #% Madam President , I should like to congratulate , in her absence , the rapporteur , Mrs Bennasar Tous , on her report . #% Two years on , still no action . #% - British Conservatives are in the forefront of those seeking to improve human rights in many parts of the world . #% I know the European Parliament voted for you , but you were the only candidate that was offered to us . #% The best approach would be to find ways of postponing the single tariff , and to negotiate and agree to a fair solution that allows all suppliers to continue to trade . #% What I am proposing is that this commitment should now be implemented urgently as regards transport and health . #% It is not clear whether the ECT states will be signed up to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% I would like to see the impact assessments being truly independent , better than what we have quite often at the moment : a justification for the need for legislation . #% Undoubtedly , there are many possibilities for developing the EU 's relationship with the OSCE . #% To a certain extent the interim agreements and accompanying PCAs are intended to encourage the independence of these countries and assist with the transition to market economies and democratic development . #% Why else would so many of our governments be increasingly seeking to recruit from third countries at all skill levels if this were not the case ? #% To the Commission and the Council I would say : note the strength of unity in this Parliament on these key issues ; cooperate with us in partnership and the beneficiaries will be the European consumers in every Member State . #% Madam President , this is the first or maiden speech that I shall make in this Chamber and in the tradition of the House of Commons from which I came , I should normally spend a great deal of time talking about the beauty of my area . #% We must recognise the positive step forward reflected by the elections to the Legislative Council . #% Also a recommendation that taxpayers should compensate Equitable Life policyholders but not National Provident Institution policyholders or failed institutional pension scheme members whose case is no less convincing . #% Madam President , that was a very good example of a French expression of an inferiority complex vis-à-vis America ! #% Never has the EU 's gerrymandering been so clearly displayed alongside its contempt for UK voters . #% A lot of concern , however , has been voiced at the pressure on Malta and Lampedusa , and quite rightly . #% Finally , I would like to thank all the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and of Parliament for their support . #% We must take the opportunity of transforming a process which is currently being applied to the candidate countries into a genuine European Union peer review process , so that the standards of citizenship and human rights applied in each of our Member States is the concern of all of us on a cross-national basis . #% As parliamentarians we are not even allowed as observers much less as participants . #% On that basis , it seems to be a measure of the self-importance of the Members of this Parliament that they are seeking information that is not in the public domain . #% Those are the kind of important things that the European Union can do . #% The language in which I drafted the report was not one in which there is gender discrimination and I would not have put it in . #% Let me revert now to my rapporteur 's role . #% Mr President , the report that I am presenting this morning is effectively a dual report which reflects the work of the committee itself and the work of the office of Parliament 's Mediator for Transnationally Abducted Children , Mrs Banotti . #% While I do accept that Morocco is an important ally of the West in the fight against terrorism , it is deeply regrettable that Morocco will not deliver on its stated commitments to the terms of the UN settlement plan . #% 
I have written to Mr Kallas asking for some correct answers , and Mr Borrell received a copy of that letter . #% The European Convention on Human Rights imposes an obligation to protect life , which must mean investigating suspicious deaths . #% For these reasons , we have voted against the resolution . #% Should you not be consulting the European Parliament before making the agreements that the Council intends to make ? #% If the EU had the same road safety records as these two countries there would be 17 000 fewer road fatalities a year , a reduction of 39 % on current levels , going a great way to achieving the 50 % reduction in fatalities by 2010 . #% That breakaway territory of Moldova is a haven for criminal activity , including money laundering and arms smuggling , and poses a serious security problem for the EU after 2007 , when our borders will extend to Moldova . #% I would therefore like to clarify exactly which information outlets we are dealing with , explain the nature , size and impact of the subsidies provided by the Commission to them and update her and the House on the Commission 's latest course of action in direct response to her question and the numerous questions and representations on this issue by Members of this House and others . #% We certainly all agree here in this Chamber that education is of vital importance and that an educated workforce is the cornerstone of Europe 's future prosperity . #% That is one I am sure that will pass with flying colours . #% I have run out of time . #% Mr President , could I issue you with a special invitation ? #% But I remain convinced that , unless we are able to send a clear signal by reasserting the position we took at first reading , there will not be that incentive that comes from the clear knowledge that these sanctions are there and will be implemented . #% My second point -- and the most important point to me -- is that the European Constitution is unconstitutional in terms of the British Constitution in relation to Magna Carta , the Bill of Rights and various other acts of ... #% In my view that is the biggest obstacle to accession to the European Union . #% In fact , it can be read the other way : despite the diary clash ( with his first appearance as Prime Minister at the Commons Liaison Committee ) making it impossible to be there in time for the ceremony , he insisted on going anyway to sign in person rather than leave it just to David Miliband , which would have been perfectly possible . #% Finally , the key issues of universal access . #% This will become much more important with the enlargement of the European Union to include a lot of very poor countries . #% Whilst it has supported projects in Asia to a great degree it has failed to address properly and with sufficient vigour the problems of refugees and internally displaced people in Latin America . #% The first reactor from KEDO scheduled to be online by the end of next year is currently running seven years late . #% In relation to amendments 16 and 34 , we express our deep concern regarding the suspension of the Pakistan Chief Justice and subsequent unrest that has led to over 40 deaths . #% Either the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , in its 53rd session did express condemnation , or it did not . #% If you look at these reports and the work that we have undertaken on economic and monetary union , despite the difficulties that we have had , including the economic downturn in the early 1990s , we have now reached a point where the momentum behind economic and monetary union is unstoppable . #% We very much welcome the support given to the UNHCR and other bodies in assisting those displaced . #% British citizens engaged in the harmless pursuit of plane-spotting find themselves in prison in Greece without trial . #% What we need is the ability to act quickly where the law is not upheld . #% At a time when the European Union has to stand firm in New York in seeking to strengthen support for a strong Human Rights Council in the United Nations , all of us could reflect on whether the European Union itself gives sufficient priority to human rights vis-à-vis the importance we give to trade and development in our own external relations . #% That is why , in the own-initiative report last year , I asked for a single directive to cover all areas that were not yet covered . #% This will not only benefit the environment but also save motorists money - it is cash in people 's pockets , which is very important at this time . #% Mr President , there are three points I wish to address . #% We have suffered greatly from that . #% I very much welcome the section on sex tourism . #% The trouble is that the Friday mornings are the one section of our work as a plenary session which is not televised either to our rooms or for the archives . #% The naming and shaming of retailers who do not forward the benefit of cheap imports to the consumer is a smokescreen for the Commission 's poor management of the challenges of globalisation . #% Mr President , there are powerful arguments both for and against Turkey 's proposed membership of the European Union . #% It is because we have gone out of our way to make it hard for them . #% But this is an opportunity to talk about renewing faith in the Schengen system and the integrity of the European Union itself , and an opportunity to improve a completely outdated and ineffective evaluation mechanism . #% Similarly , as Satu Hassi has said , we have a long history on asbestos , and we have a very strong feeling that we need to watch out for that . #% We therefore can not allow that knowledge to be stolen from those to whom it belongs as doing that will undermine the economic base of the society . #% We must ask : without such information , how can the Commission be certain that structural fund projects , which are usually large , will not damage sites potentially of European Union-wide importance ? #% I am quite happy to accept Mr Gawronski 's amendment in this connection , since it shows up the ludicrous nature of the gap in competence . #% To the extent that I am also a stakeholder , I will therefore do the only thing I can in this House : thrust my own stake through the heart of this proposal and vote against it . #% He will understand , however , that without notice of that question I am hardly in a position to give him the detail that he would want on the specific environmental questions that he raises . #% This benefits the large EU and US delegations , but leaves some developing countries ' ministers -- those unable to split themselves in two -- feeling helpless , often knowing less than the omnipresent NGOs and corporate fat cats . #% Due to the success of the informal trialogue he felt that there was no need for a new , lengthy debate on the programme , which passed unopposed through the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism at its last meeting . #% Focusing on the situation in East Jerusalem , I welcome very much the Swedish Presidency 's initiative and its clarity over the role of Jerusalem as a capital of two states and your firmness about the importance of Israel freezing its settlement activity in East Jerusalem . #% In some respects the situation is actually getting worse . #% What is cost here ? #% There is considerable doubt as to whether these developments will result in the restoration of full constitutional government in Fiji , so this issue still remains highly important and of topical interest . #% How these aspects of life are handled domestically in China now has , and will continue in the future to have , repercussions on the way in which relations between China and both foreign countries and foreign businesses develop . #% What is important to most people is the air they breathe , the food they eat and the water they drink - indeed , the water which helps to grow the food they eat . #% We must remember this was discovered in January 1999 and the Commission was only able to take action after a period of months and a good deal of obfuscation . #% We need to find ways in which we can sensibly regulate the Internet in everyone 's interests . #% Already two new investment projects at Tilbury have been put on hold because of the uncertainty created by this directive . #% I welcome the opening of negotiations with Turkey . #% Other speakers have already said that we will need a strong Commission during 2004 to ensure that we can manage the responsibilities of the Union effectively . #% The Accession Treaty signed by Bulgaria and Romania on 25 April last year , and already ratified by 15 EU Member States , deliberately contains various sorts of what might be called ` conditionality ' . #% We must take care not to undermine our own efforts to fight deforestation and climate change by simultaneously providing the largest market for illegal timber products in the world . #% I hope he was wrongly quoted , because as far as I know , we are not . #% This document is a useful step forward in the improvement of EU governance and to that extent we welcome it warmly . #% She has a really tough task on her hands but I am sure that she will get the full support that she recognises that she needs from the European Parliament . #% Mr President , I have been most surprised by the arguments from the Council and the Commission suggesting that a marketing ban would be , as they say , `` not WTO-secure '' , yet the WTO rules in this area are distinctly unclear . #% Indeed , I ask Commissioner Rehn this : if the Council decides to start talks ` without delay ' , would he indicate in his reply how he would interpret this ? #% Let us perhaps be prepared to assist and guide that convergence and respect the conditionality of the further harmonisation which is integral to Professor MacCormick ' s proposals . #% I would like to go through one or two detailed matters before I tackle the issue of health insurance . #% If banks do not trust one another and inter-bank lending is frozen , we have a big problem . #% Nevertheless , Afghanistan has come a long way since the rout of Mullah Omar and the disappearance , hopefully for good , of Osama Bin Laden . #% 
As people have said , for many patients , this will work well , but we also need to take care of our patients in our own Member States . #% We wanted a political programme and legislative programme and Parliament to be associated with that . #% Secondly , there is the problem of South Africa in the region . #% It is all very well having something up and running later , but if I was organised crime , the time which I would be trying to engage in counterfeiting on a large scale would be around the period of introduction of the euro when you are going to have four hundred million people in the European Union and billions of people around the world who have never been familiar with the notes themselves . #% Perhaps that view may not get cheers inside this Parliament but it will get many cheers in the homes and streets of the countries we all represent . #% Until we put water projects in the south-west region , we can not complain as much as we do that opium production is not being contained . #% When I asked the Commission representatives in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection a couple of months ago about the reported illegal recycling of sewage sludge into animal feed in some Member States , nobody could define for me what sewage sludge was , where it was being used or why . #% I have to say that it is sheer hypocrisy to continue to protect our own agricultural competitive position with higher resources , while at the same time forcing developing countries to liberalise . #% It is to protect the institution as we carry out its proper work and it is therefore a very serious matter . #% Commissioner Kinnock talked about 180 , 000 tickets being made available to football fans across Europe . #% Mr President , I want to speak on the linked issues of data protection and parliamentary accountability . #% These are complex legal issues . #% We also recognise the importance of tackling discrimination against older workers and using other measures to help people stay in work . #% I would hope that the Commission might find itself in a position to liaise with the British authorities when it comes to investigating what might have been the cause , so that any wisdom that emerges could be shared throughout our 25 Member States . #% It is neither bureaucratic , nor is it costly . #% Clearly we also need greater synergy between the different Commission initiatives for improving legislation . #% I should like to refer in particular to Turkey . #% It was then given by the international community to Ethiopia in federation , and then it was annexed by that country . #% Far from sending shiploads of money to Eastern Europe , they would do better to make sure that the prosperity of Europe as a whole is not compromised . #% Let us please explore all routes , but let us keep Paradise in mind so that the objectives we all share can indeed be fulfilled . #% We are always holding you up . #% Does he not agree that the message to the organisers of Europe 2000 , to the organisers of Europe 2004 and the possible organisers of the Mondiale 2006 , whether in Germany or the United Kingdom , is that they can ignore the rules , maximise profits and in the end , all it costs them is the small change ? #% The question to the President of the Commission is whether this reform is still on course and what has now happened to the mid-term review . #% Workers possess one of the most important resources for any industrial enterprise - craft knowledge and experience . #% But unless the Member States demonstrate a political will to pursue joint action , the development of the common defence and security policy in the context of the transatlantic alliance will not have the force that it both demands and deserves . #% Five women per day are diagnosed with breast cancer in my own region . #% However , any legislation that comes forward to regulate this sector must be from the national sporting bodies or authorities such as FIFA and UEFA . #% It is important that , whilst human need is met , standards of health and safety and quality be maintained . #% Nobody can pretend that democracy is the answer to everything , but without fair and free democratic elections many other things are simply impossible . #% My report would , I am sure , go some way to reassuring people . #% My own view , and that of my group , on this is that , whilst the emphasis put on donor selection and the appropriate testing of donations is fairly adequate - and it has been outlined by Mr Cabrol in his remarks - we still need to look very carefully at the monitoring of recipients of blood transfusions . #% There have been requests for money , which does not exist and no one has said where it is going to come from . #% The original rationale behind duty-free is clearly flawed and clearly the people who had the idea never envisaged the single market which we are trying to work towards at the moment . #% A European Commission survey recently said that , had we used this principle across the European Union over the last 15 years , our pension funds would probably have performed at least twice as well as they have in fact performed . #% Mr President , the arrest at the weekend of Aung San Suu Kyi , the leader of the Burmese National League for Democracy , is deplorable and shows that the military regime in Burma has no intention of democratic reform . #% So perhaps we can not afford to have any more intermediate events : the stakes have to be raised and you have to try and extract everything you can from every possible meeting . #% We must not forget that , if this is a directive which adds to the sum total of European workers ' rights , perhaps we could be exporting this type of model elsewhere in the world . #% Mr President , I should like to take Commissioner Bolkestein back to the last part-session here when we discussed sales promotion . #% One man 's State aid is another man 's tax . #% And who loses out ? #% Finally , not as a spokesman of my group but as an individual who worships Sunday-by-Sunday in a British church where we have members of the congregation who see India as their mother country , let me assure the people of India that they are in our prayers and that we pray for both the persecuted and the persecutors . #% The League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty has 113 members from all parties in both Houses in Japan , representing almost one sixth of MPs . #% I take it from that - although not necessarily agree with the point - that when technical measures mean selectivity they can not be used towards MAGP targets . #% Reforms , however , can not be a further hurdle to concluding accession negotiations , just as enlargement should not hold up the reform of the CAP . #% We are calling on European governments and the EU to intensify their engagement to use all their political influence in Southern Africa to help bring about rapid change for the better in Zimbabwe and pave the way for properly monitored elections to be held in an atmosphere free from intimidation . #% Indeed David Cameron predicted that the first openly gay Prime Minister in the UK would be a Tory . #% The report does not replace harm reduction with other measures , least of all ` JUST SAY NO ' , which does not work . #% This of course puts the visit in an entirely different context . #% Commissioner , I do not doubt your personal commitment to openness and transparency , but I do not want action plans for our citizens . #% The McCartney murder has shown that this is happening in Northern Ireland . #% The EU must work with governments and local and international NGOs to put an end to this trade . #% It is therefore no surprise to me to see the EU attempt to sign up to an agreement that has been condemned by dolphin conservationists . #% It is completely self-defeating to impose unachievable limits . #% I voted for this excellent report but deeply regret the lack of final agreement on the budget allocation . #% This is the same flag and anthem that you said had been dropped after the French and Dutch very sensibly said ` no ' to the dreaded EU Constitution . #% I believe we need central supplies under the Solidarity Fund which he and the ECDC can then direct swiftly to where they are needed , so that we can smother the outbreak and prevent it hitting the rest of us even more seriously . #% Highly volatile cargoes enter and leave that port every day . #% Mr President , this report comes from a Commission proposal presented in January 2000 , a proposal drafted under Articles 149 and 150 , which called on the Member States to foster the mobility of people undertaking a course of study , a period of training , voluntary work , or work as a teacher or trainer in another Member State , whether on a Community programme or not . #% Getting on and off buses is the point at which most accidents happen , especially to those who are vulnerable . #% The manufacturers need this legislation to make them do the right thing . #% The Commission report was extremely optimistic . #% She has pleased just about every nationality except one , namely my own , in the way she has taken on the majority of interests . #% We paid particular attention to that when ministers and interested groups came together , particularly in Belfast and then in Innsbrück . #% It is a good week for this point to be brought to our attention . #% I am fascinated by this ! #% In fact , a number of ministers have said the same thing , and are obviously reading from the same script - i.e. do we really want a social model that throws 20 million into unemployment ? #% 
There are many examples of national laws which directly discriminate against disabled people . #% In spite of massive international financial assistance , where the European Community in particular has been a major contributor , only a small proportion of anti-personnel landmines have been cleared and the casualty rate continues to be very high . #% However , if the security services openly state that they are targeting young , ethnic-minority men , the rest of society may also begin to view those who fit this profile with suspicion . #% It would be extremely useful for many people in Europe to know what is being done . #% Was it the Director-General of Budgets ? #% What I would say is that we must learn lessons from this crisis . #% Current unemployment levels , particularly among young people , are worrying and more needs to be done to ensure that young people are able to gain vital skills and qualifications . #% Therefore , I wholeheartedly welcome moves by the Commission to tighten up this situation and combat harmful tax practices once and for all . #% Why have you cut up the cake in the way you have ? #% In its reform package of 30 October , the Commission approved the principles outlined above . #% Shark numbers in many cases are said to have dropped by 90 % since Spielberg 's film ` Jaws ' was released . #% Are these afflictions of the past , or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations ? #% First of all I would like to quote the evidence that was given by the regional CBI . #% We are dismayed to note that , to date , the majority of the Member States have not satisfactorily delivered on their obligation and therefore , despite the traditional ` gentleman 's agreement ' between Parliament and Council , we will not grant discharge until such time as the Member States fulfil their obligations under the Interinstitutional Agreement . #% Today we three have tabled this motion because our concern then for human rights has been compounded now by allegations following the presidential elections . #% On culture - less than 0.5 % of total expenditure - we must have an effective procedure for the A-30 lines . #% Mr President , I rise under Rule 108 . #% The prize for getting this framework right is very great . #% Early this year , when voting on the transit inquiry report , the House decided that the follow-up should go to the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% It has to be remembered that on the day the alarm was first raised the disease had already taken hold in over 50 farms in 16 different counties . #% Most Members will find this motion uncontentious . #% We need to respond to the wishes and needs of the citizens , which was what we were charged to do at Laeken and where we have , unfortunately , currently failed the test . #% It is very easy to say that liberalisation in aviation has been a glowing success , without ever recognising that there is also a negative side . #% Madam President , I would just like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate . #% However , I am very concerned about the effect in my city of postponing the deadlines , perhaps until 2018 instead of 2010 , for hot spots . #% The effects of the Chernobyl disaster are still of grave consequence and something like a quarter of the country is still contaminated by radioactive fall-out . #% That is the day we remember those who have been killed in the workplace or by illnesses related to their work . #% In fact , there is little to distinguish the extreme Left and the extreme Right and they feed off one another . #% Subsequently , changes were introduced to satisfy DG I. #% However , the demand for such produce has risen enormously over the last few years , and not just because of the BSE crisis : our supermarkets simply can not obtain enough organic produce to keep pace with this rising demand from their customers , even when looking to other Member States to meet the shortfall . #% They can be controlled by a proper licensing and control regime which they have said that they are willing to pay for . #% What the citizens of Europe should be informed about is not the impenetrable Constitution , but the mountain of EU legislation which will pass through the EU 's institutions this year -- legislation dreamt up by a defunct Commission and approved by an expired Parliament , both of whom are no longer accountable to the people this programme will affect . #% Secondly , we would highlight their attempt to restore the cuts in the INTERREG programme by some EUR 33 million in the payments , restoring that heading to the budget . #% It is a bit dry and boring and that is why there are not many people listening to us tonight . #% Mr Cameron can simply choose not to re-ratify it , or he can belatedly uphold his cast-iron guarantee and give the British people the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty that they were denied . #% We have common interests like fighting nuclear proliferation and building peace in the Middle East . #% It is a question of water provision and ` chill-out rooms ' and so on , and not a question of ` shooting rooms ' , which is a completely different matter . #% I thought I was speaking such clear English that they would manage perfectly but I will , of course , slow down . #% Until then , these guarantees represented a vital lifeline of an economic nature to the regime which craves any vestige of legitimacy , not least because of Ahmadinejad 's contempt for human rights , as evidenced by the regular execution of homosexuals , political dissenters and minors . #% The structural funds are essential for ensuring that the enhanced prosperity engendered by the single European market is spread move evenly and that less prosperous regions are helped to catch up . #% Our rapporteur Mr Evans notes that the competitiveness of European business is one of the key objectives of the Lisbon Agenda . #% Householders will move towards separating glass , paper and plastic from general rubbish , and business will have to work with local councils to fund new equipment and set up new installations to deal with the flow of materials . #% Those buildings will have to be demolished at some point , and the asbestos will have to be removed , repaired or maintained , with the consequent effect on the health and safety of all those asbestos workers . #% My report makes a number of recommendations : simplified , liberalised and more flexible rules of origin , full duty-free , quota-free market access for the ACP , workable safeguards , dispute settlement and monitoring mechanisms with transparent provisions and a real power to act in the event of changes caused by EPAs having a harmful effect on sectors of ACP economies . #% So , like Members across this House tonight , I welcome the creation of the new Human Rights Council . #% Let us name and blame those countries that divert the flood of the market away from its natural channels by their use of the logjams of inconvenience . #% Could I go on to say how much I welcome this agreement , which is not before time , and give my congratulations to all those involved in resolving the difficulties . #% In 1989 , he earned USD 15 billion from oil and he spent 13 billion on arms . #% First : What was the point of solemnly proclaiming the Charter of Fundamental Rights , should the Council be unwilling to implement it ? #% However , he should remember that what we are asking for is full disclosure . #% As has already been mentioned , earlier this month I hosted a lunch debate in Brussels with the Involvement and Participation Association for my fellow members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to share with them UK best practice and the benefits of flexibility , because that is the issue . #% They are now free to flourish . #% Large numbers of EU ships will soon need to be scrapped following the recent and welcome decision to accelerate the phase-out of single-hull tankers , but there is a very real danger that they will be dumped on Asian beaches to be dealt with under very poor conditions . #% And yet we have criticised accession countries heavily for their treatment of the Roma people . #% My own scepticism remains . #% Already America has placed it on the list of banned terrorist organisations and even the Palestinian Authority has cracked down by freezing its financial assets and closing down its newspapers . #% And all for what ? #% I am therefore grateful , in one sense , that the vote was deferred . #% Notwithstanding Mr Rovsing 's remarks just now , we must still make the Kaliningrad solution work , and work in a way which does not undermine the sovereignty of Lithuania . #% The advice that I and colleagues received from the police is that victims will cooperate with police voluntarily once they and their families are safe . #% The fact is that Nicaragua can not possibly meet the interest of capital repayments on its debt in the long term , and its commitments are almost double the 20 % of export earnings set as a ceiling by the World Bank in its highly-indebted countries initiative . #% The President of the Commission can not unilaterally take existing agreements and tear them up . #% How can you book concert halls if you do not know that you are going to have the money ? #% I very much hope we will defend a good budget but also keep an eye on focus in the programme . #% So I support the intent of the debate . #% As the number of elderly people grows , the requirement for good healthcare and care services grows also . #% 
I welcome this report by my colleague , Malcolm Harbour , who has set out ways in which Europe can begin to close that productivity gap . #% For that reason alone I will not follow Mr Parish in his more provocative remarks . #% Public education began as a tool of repression in 1996 in China , but it has escalated since 2005 . #% I particularly welcome the fact that we are training domestic observers - I think that is very important and will offset the likelihood of Mugabe criticising us for coming in in a neo-colonialist way to interfere in his election . #% Can the Council confirm that at the meeting on Saturday of foreign ministers this point of crisis management and coordination - contingency planning - will be on the agenda in case the situation gets worse ? #% Indeed , ratings have been a bit too ` convenient ' for regulators to lean on too , driving out proper due diligence . #% With growers receiving such a poor reward for their efforts , it is not surprising that Oxfam describes this as a situation that affects health and education and the whole rural community . #% I also lament the lateness in bringing forward the much-needed Community patent , due to excessive sensitivity on the language issue which will only add to the cost for SMEs and make the procedures unworkable . #% A further message is that no country is in the European Union yet . #% It is simply not good enough to say , as this glossy publication does , that you can not set these timetables because that would be the equivalent of announcing the date for a cure for cancer . #% You think you have to start looking at benchmarking , which is very difficult . #% It is not a question of whether or not the recommendations in the report are sound . #% I recognise that extra expenditure resulting from the European External Action Service and new European supervisory authorities is required and is supported by all Member States , including the UK , in the Council . #% Of course , companies need to make profits to survive , and many jobs are provided by the biotechnological industries . #% Although this is happening in the United States , it could also be affecting European citizens . #% It is not a case of saying one thing and doing another from that side of the House . #% The lack of information coming from there worried the Commission as late as June this year , and the further east you go , the more worrying the situation gets . #% E-consumers , in common with all weaker parties to a contract and indeed European citizens in general , deserve and should be given the right to a fair hearing . #% In this way we will be responding to the wishes of European citizens , instead of producing mountains of paperwork that destroy forests and also stand the chance of not being read . #% That is the main gist of the opinion of the Committee on Employment . #% Why has it not been decided to ban all meats coming in ? #% We must ensure that these funds are not subject in any way to fraud as this will undermine the legitimacy of what the European Union is trying to achieve . #% Parliament 's report and the amendments tabled tend to extend the scope of the directive and make the limits with which both existing and future plants must comply more stringent . #% I would like to start also by congratulating the rapporteur on this report . #% But , joy of joys , the wall came down and we finished up with 27 nations , and those people lived in democracy and 500 million people lived in peace ... #% Mr President , I certainly hope that it will not be the last time that I am speaking here on agriculture to Mr Fischler as a member of the Commission , because over the years he has done an extremely good job . #% Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored . #% However , my British Conservative colleagues and I are unable to support the report overall because we do not accept in principle that the long-term solution to many of the problems in this field is the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor , an idea which is reiterated in this report ( paragraphs 43-45 ) . #% Our resolution lists names , and we demand the release of those names , the end of ill-treatment in those cases where they are actually still alive , and access to them for the Red Cross . #% As the text stands at present , employers would be required to do a risk assessment every day , bringing in technical and organisational measures to protect workers . #% If the rules were obeyed we would have no problem . #% Again , on the one hand , the problem is that the secretive and complex system adopted by the Council does not facilitate external scrutiny , which therefore negates any resemblance of accountability and therefore democracy . #% I am glad that he recognizes that some European countries which trade in the United States have been intimidated by the very possibility of legal action being taken against them and that there are other American laws which have been used against law-abiding Europeans citizens . #% Would we then have to go back to the drawing-board ? #% in writing . - The right agreed in 2001 for developing countries to produce generic medicines was a welcome one . #% There is no reason , and there is no excuse , for the promotion of hatred . #% We fully and firmly agree with the trilateral statement made by President Bush , Prime Minister Koizumi and President Kim Dae-jung at the APEC Summit meeting at the weekend calling on North Korea to dismantle its admitted uranium enrichment programme in a prompt and verifiable manner and to come into full compliance with all international obligations in conformity with North Korea 's recent commitment in the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration . #% There should be a moratorium on all current and planned urbanisation projects in the region until new legislation which fully respects property rights is adopted by the Valencian Parliament . #% I have a positive proposal for all of you . #% I have seen the results of the chemical weapons . #% However , all of it makes me think , because just last weekend there was a Commonwealth conference . #% He must never be allowed to use weapons of mass destruction again . #% Four out of five maritime accidents are due to human error or human incompetence . #% The countries of eastern and central Europe are joining the Union to escape that sort of policy . #% Nevertheless , when we were in Seattle we had excellent talks with US legislators . #% I hope the Commission will take advantage of the European Convention to present some proposals to change the enforcement procedures to stop Member States getting away with breaking their commitments and playing the system . #% Egypt incarcerates 55 gay men who are still denied legal representation and now face up to eight years in prison because they are gay . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by repeating a distinction made by Mr Wibe which is quite crucial . #% I hope that the changes we have seen over the past four years will be taken forward when the Convention is finally ratified and Parliament given its rightful place as one arm of the budgetary authority , thereby maintaining its strategic role for future years . #% It will be ignored by the Council . #% Under the Commission proposal - the change to the Sixth VAT Directive - there will be a shift in the place of taxation to the place of establishment of the recipient of the services , the customers ' base , and away from that of the supplier , the telecommunications company 's base . #% So , I welcome the report but I am not going to rush to judgment on the basis of it . #% Many in the industry not only accept the need to end animal testing , but have also put their own resources to that end . #% The point I want to make is that it is imperative we get this dealt with as soon as possible because the skiing season is almost upon us and we want to ensure that British and Danish ski instructors have the opportunity to teach in the Alps as from this season . #% What is really required is for eurozone members to have the political will to deliver on their current obligations . #% Mr President , the British Government is proceeding with a programme of reorganisation of the English and Welsh police forces on a regional basis . #% Mr President , I have four questions . #% What I want to say to the Commission representative and to you , as our representative here , is that if this proposal does not go to conciliation in which the view of Parliament is heard , including the views of those Member States who were not members of the Union when this proposal first came forward , then we make a mockery of our right to be consulted and to be absorbed into this discussion . #% Paragraph 10 states that the distributive trades , small and medium-sized enterprises , suffer disproportionately from over-regulation as a result both of European Community directives and of national regulations . #% How appropriate it is , therefore , that this measure should be approved by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs - the ultimate Orwellian inversion . #% This report has taken political correctness to a whole new level . #% We praise the courage of the Zimbabwean cricketers - Andy Flower and Henry Olonga - for wearing those black armbands to symbolise the lack of democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe . #% The most important thing we must reflect on is that we do not just have a political declaration , we also have an action plan and we have two years in which to make some real demonstrable progress before this summit reconvenes in Tunis . #% Mr Daul , you said that the sugar regime was a special agreement . #% Perhaps some time we could be told how Mr Mormino achieves his great rank and honour and how he is then given the authority to have the concert to honour the President at a time when Members can not come and to do so in association with a private company . #% We need the highest standards possible , and in that respect , this report has made substantial improvements . #% 
Both the vote in the Citizens ' Rights Committee and the rapporteurs have been pushed aside and there has been a cosy stitch-up between the Presidency and the leadership of the two big groups . #% We can apply that to many other amendments , but please try to understand that it is not for dogmatic reasons , it really is a matter of simplicity . #% The institutions are acting within their Treaty powers . #% That is all that anybody asks and that is what this report asks . #% We need to revisit that . #% The East Midlands Textile Association runs numerous projects -- funded through the European Regional Development Fund -- which assist companies : projects such as MAS , which helps small businesses in the region to branch out into new markets , or the Business ICT Bureau , which provides an expert source of ICT help specific to the needs of the textile sector . #% There are other ways to pull Europe out of the crisis : putting people at the heart of our policy agenda and especially those who have been most hit by the crisis . #% That is how desperately serious it is . #% An authority that understands that risk can never be eliminated but it can be adequately spotted and dealt with . #% We should support rural development ; we should compensate farmers to ensure that environmental concerns are addressed . #% I do not share all the Brok report 's objectives , but I remain an interested observer of this revolutionary change from the city state of some 2 000 years ago , to the 19th-century nation-state , and to the EU Member State that we are witnessing today . #% We are not here to finance such naked and cynical propaganda . #% Relating to Amendment No 10 #% It sets time limits , graduated in accordance with the difficulties involved , and it sets new standards of reference which should and will be respected . #% Taking up what the Commissioner has said in the last few moments , the problem seems to be not so much with the Scottish or Welsh Offices which have both agreed to the projects submitted . #% There are problems there that will have to be investigated . #% We therefore look forward to the action plan on sustainable production and consumption next year , which we assume will be a move forward in terms of eco-efficiency and in spelling out how we are to decouple environmental damage from growth . #% This will not be a resource-free exercise . #% We have asked in our oral question particularly about whether Member States are required to include an evaluation of the social impact in their reports that they submit to the Commission . #% Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I should like to point out that we will be supporting the joint resolution on Zimbabwe . #% So , Commissioner Borg , my advice is ` sling your hook ' ! #% Why not look at an event beforehand and not worry about the consequences of the bad actions of a few violent people after such a football event . #% It is now clear that this issue is going to be addressed in the new forthcoming chemicals policy . #% I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to do everything within their powers to exert pressure and influence on the Libyan authorities in order to bring this case to a satisfactory conclusion and secure the release of the Bulgarian nurses , and indeed of the Palestinian doctor . #% The proceedings against individuals for their actions in the former Yugoslavia and against General Pinochet of Chile demonstrate that accountability for human rights violations is now seen as transcending national frontiers . #% This is why I attend meetings of United Nations associations in my East of England constituency , where the role and ideals of the UN are cherished at a very local level . #% Mr President , if cooperation with third countries is being considered , could we make it a condition for Europol , which is , of course , of immense value in the fight against crime , that it should not take action against individuals based on suspicions of committing acts which are not offences in the European Union but may be offences in third countries which do not recognize civil liberties and freedom of expression in the same way that we recognize them in the Union ? #% We certainly intend to do that . #% I would argue that these facts very clearly speak for themselves . #% Some rogues collect up boarding cards from innocent and naive passengers and take them along to the duty-free shop and cash them in for much larger amounts than they are actually permitted by the regulation . #% The first speaker in the main meeting was Mr Hughes . #% I am delighted that it will , by ensuring that the Member States provide adequate facilities at all their ports , that their ships and masters are obliged to use them , that the fees system is fair and balanced and above all that 25 % of ships are inspected to ensure these requirements are met . #% I hope that we will come to the right decisions concerning value-for-money for the citizens of Europe . #% Third , on terrorism , the report is right to condemn terrorism in all its forms , as well as to insist that all actions to combat terrorism fully respect international human rights and humanitarian law . #% For the EU to forego the right to a level playing field which would allow SMEs to have an equal opportunity to compete like the large multinationals seems both extraordinary and indeed unacceptable . #% Mr President , I am very pleased that the political groups have reached a compromise position on this report , which actually consists of two reports rolled into one . #% The gross cost of personnel policy reform to 2006 will be around EUR111 .9 million . #% That is questionable . #% In particular , Iran funds terrorist groups that are still holding hostage a number of Israeli soldiers who are officially posted as missing in action . #% We all agree on the principle of equality and I would say it is our basic right , but why include issues which muddy the water ? #% It would be more accurate to say that I judged the EU to be an unfit organisation for either of them to join . #% Therefore , I repeat my request for this Parliament to conduct an investigation into these allegations . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , in paragraph , please insert the adjective ` secular ' , so that the phrase would be : ` stable , democratic , pluralist , secular and prosperous society ' . #% As a member of Parliament 's Electoral Observer Commission , I agree with colleagues that we have a crucial role to play to ensure that the commitments made by the Palestinian Authority at the London conference on security , democratic reform and good governance are realised . #% It has been a painful process , but now is not the time to make a judgment on exactly what in six months ' time the consumption will be in Europe . #% I understand that if they do not move before Wednesday of this week , they will be unable to return home for Christmas . #% Indeed , in many parts of Europe , a great many of the problems about ozone are not necessarily a consequence of activities by that individual Member State . #% And now the growing numbers of Karen and Shan refugees in Thailand present new problems for the countries of ASEAN . #% Freedom Party ministers continue to echo Nazi party slogans and rhetoric of the Thirties and Forties . #% More proactive planning guidance , preferably linked to regional renewable targets , and feasibility studies would be helpful additions to the directive . #% However , I am anxious to know what provisions have been outlined for these regions which find themselves without an agreement . #% I support all the reports incidentally . #% The report conveys some very clear messages about what should be avoided in the future and what should be done in the horrific eventuality that another outbreak occurs . #% No-one is suggesting that this be introduced tomorrow , but I recommend that the process be set in train so that as far as sales on new cars are concerned , we will eventually get to the position where registration tax is phased out . #% Europe should pursue this not only because it is currently the policy of the Republic of Korea but because it is the right way to go . #% For example , in the UK the system by which a ship pays the waste collector each time it uses waste facilities , without the port getting involved , works well . #% But just to put the whole debate in a global context , I think it is important to remind ourselves that worldwide the vast majority of people never have made a telephone call and never in their lives will make a telephone call and it is important not to forget information poverty on that scale . #% We should act to do something before it is too late . #% Regretfully I am not sure that my group will be able to fully support the proposals overall despite the improvements that Mrs Smet and the Parliament team have been able to obtain in this very difficult situation . #% Would you accept that principle ? #% And about time too ! #% Who are these people ? #% Mr President , Parliament has been a consistent supporter of enlargement and , in particular , the timely accession of Bulgaria and Romania . #% Mr President , I am very pleased to be opening the debate . #% Secondly - and this appears in the Liberal Group 's resolution and also in the compromise resolution - the anthrax problem in the United States has drawn all our attention to the need to react quickly and to analyse what is happening . #% Mrs Kinnock from the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly was there ; there were Members from the Development Committee and the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee , including me . #% 
For the record , Mr Ford , the formal proposal to the committee to prepare this report came from me . #% There are those of us here who will continue to speak for the people and to speak out against these institutions which , as the EFD Group has said before on several occasions and will do so again , are short of democratic legitimacy . #% John Wiggins , a former member of the European Court of Auditors , is quoted in a British newspaper saying that the situation in the Commission is unchanged . #% We see what happened with the Wonderland Club , where individuals had to provide 10,000 photographs of naked children in order to get into that Wonderland Club . #% Secondly , could I ask about the process whereby dangerous products , or products that are deemed to be dangerous , are removed from the market . #% I should like to mention Mrs Sinnott 's remarks . #% Firstly , there is the whole issue of classification of these micro-organisms . #% What do our German friends think ? #% I am thinking here of the nature of hedgerows and the working of fields and orchards , the management of which has been seriously interfered with by EU legislation , to the detriment of bees in Britain . #% Clinton signed at the last moment but made a ( public ) declaration recommending that his successor should not present the treaty to the Senate for ratification . #% Mr President , I speak in place of Mr Van Hecke , who has had to leave Strasbourg early as he is travelling to the Democratic Republic of the Congo tomorrow . #% In this regard , the European Parliament will no doubt be involved in the normal procedures . #% I have been also involved in the report on Uzbekistan and the question of a carrot-and-stick approach to this Central Asian republic which has no traditions of human rights or democracy and is now taking firm steps in that direction , something that must be encouraged . #% ... there is a real debate , there is a real debate here . #% Too often EU laws get set in stone . #% Postal services are performed by a necessary network of such people . #% Restricting the scope of the resolution to President Ahmadinejad 's call to ` wipe Israel off the world map ' was a wasted opportunity to highlight Iran 's apparent determination to make a nuclear bomb and its widespread human rights abuses , including the regular execution of consenting homosexuals and others who commit acts branded by the regime as ` crimes of sexual chastity ' . #% This will make sure that the workers on board vessels from third countries having recourse to our ports are covered by the same broad arrangements as the agreement between the two sides of industry . #% Alternative processes are then required - business angels or groups of investors , private investors - bringing together people with ideas on one side and money on the other . #% This is surely a good thing . #% I am sure it would . #% Mr President , the previous debate in this Chamber was about the screening of proposals for legislation . #% So far , the United Kingdom is the only country that has offered 100 % debt cancellation . #% I would also say to the Commission that I strongly agree with the Commissioner that it is important to lay the foundations for further development of the temporary work sector . #% Often we pass legislation , but do not look at what it has actually achieved . #% It is , therefore , important that we focus our work on areas where the EU can add value and make a real difference . #% Oh really ? #% Yes , it will be possible for competition and investment to be dealt with at Seattle , but it is important that they are dealt with in a transparent and open way . #% Therefore , I would like to make those people who wish to stick to the 150 gramme level aware of what their actions will lead to should they pursue that particular policy . #% We know that the Commission has compiled a list of settlement products and exporters , and is trying to expand the list . #% As this resolution today illustrates in graphic detail , Lukashenko has intensified his campaign for persecution and harassment against those who dare challenge his iron-fisted rule . #% In Britain we certainly have a very dynamic press , sometimes some would say too dynamic . #% We make a number of proposals that I commend to this House . #% It has lumped all funds not already covered by the UCITS Directive , from investment trusts to hedge funds , in a single mixed bag of expensive legislation . #% The challenge lies in persuading members of the public of the need to change their ways . #% As I travel around British universities speaking to students , I see a rash of ring of stars flags and EU literature . #% If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House . #% For this reason alone the Commission should not be putting forward more law . #% The area I wish to concentrate on particularly is responsible self-medication . #% That is all very good stuff and to be welcomed , continued and improved upon . #% Peace is desperately needed , and it is therefore sad that talks in Nairobi this week broke down . #% President Kennedy said of America : `` Our progress as a Union can be no swifter than our progress in education . '' #% We have to ask the Commission this afternoon precisely what legal action and legal powers the Commission has to take against the organizers so that they face some penalty rather than simply expressions of regret ? #% However , the text as agreed in Amendment No 69 is an acceptable compromise . #% Are you aware of that report on trafficking in human organs ? #% The access people have to various nominal social opportunities that exist now under the Staff Regulations will simply continue in those cases . #% I am grateful for the Minister 's assurance that there is no pilot project so far . #% We have a register of documents . #% I hope that my colleagues will support me when I say that I have always been open about this and that I have tried to put together a balanced report , taking account of all points of view in the Parliament . #% Anyone , therefore , who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian , should examine their own motives in the context of a debate , which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world . #% A vital and dynamic economy depends on an efficient financial system for collecting savings and funnelling them at low cost to the most productive uses . #% It is quite clear that penta and probably octa are really not necessary and that the risks they pose to the environment and human health do not justify their continued use as flame-retardants . #% Nor should we fail to remind the financial community of their own responsibilities . #% It is thanks to you that these new bars can be kept on the market . #% Nevertheless , in the meantime , the European Union must collectively do more to recognise that Ukraine has demonstrated political maturity in fully respecting European norms of democracy , human rights and the rule of law . #% The Council continues to focus mainly on keeping people out of Fortress Europe . #% As regards the Financial Controller , the most threatening aspect for the Committee on the Regions seems to be the endemic culture of unprofessionalism and improvisation , where lack of transparency is preferred to openness , for instance in reporting facts to OLAF . #% in writing . - With citizens across the EU facing a growing bill for the financial crisis , the measures included in this report have the potential to raise billions of euro and alleviate some of the pressure on families in these challenging financial circumstances . #% Mr President , this debate has been a clash of two pessimisms . #% The Spanish hydrological plan will be a very difficult issue for the British Labour Members of the European Parliament to decide how they are going to vote . #% For both Parliament and the Commission , enlargement is the main emphasis of this budget . #% These proposed restrictions on the good management of transport businesses make several huge and utterly unjustified assumptions . #% Whatever differences exist as regards perspectives about defence cooperation in the European Union , it seems this is something that could unite us . #% Certainly the Member States who are the culprits in the one third of the 128 infringement procedures initiated by Commissioner Monti this year . #% Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly , that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion , belief , gender , disability , age , sexual orientation , opinion , political affiliation etc ? #% In short , let us have legislation that is accessible in its form , the way we make it and the way we enforce it . #% 
It is a matter of regret that the Commission 's Communication was not the result of a full stakeholder consultation and did not appear sufficiently in advance to allow for meaningful consultation before the release of the next regulation . #% We have come to a conclusion which I consider to be a second-best solution . #% We believe this directive will ensure that and could make the difference between life and death itself . #% But does it move us forward ? #% We have to look at every available opportunity to save money . #% The Palestinians have elected a terrorist government under Hamas and the Lebanese have two Hizbollah terrorist representatives in their government . #% Finally , our message must be that the European Conference gives us a major opportunity to create a European political space that will allow us , while waiting for these negotiations , to engage in a sensible structured political dialogue with the countries which wish to join the European Union in the shorter or the longer term . #% We also need firmer action from the Commission , which , after all , is the guardian of the Treaty and protector of the directives . #% A proposal for a horizontal directive directly related to the race and ethnicity directive promised by President Borroso must be brought before this House . #% Sustained long-term efforts will be needed to change attitudes and tackle that culture . #% On Category 5 , the sad part is that we still see no solutions being proposed by the Council on how to solve the problem of pensions within the institutions . #% Putting it bluntly , why should , for instance , British courts cooperate in the removal of transnationally abducted children from their Britishbased parent , if the court of another Member State contravenes the spirit - and sometimes the words - of the Hague Convention and the Luxembourg Convention and refuses to do the same when a child is abducted to its jurisdiction ; or , as we see quite often , when the police and authorities do not seriously seek out the kidnapped children and their abductors . #% She knows that I accept nearly everything that she has done , and we in the Socialist Group will accept the entire committee 's report as it was voted . #% They are clearly addressing exactly the same issue using deliberately different language and I would have thought now that we have adopted Amendment No 10 , which I welcome , Amendment No 23 is no longer necessary . #% We get European Community directives , of which I can give one example , the famous ` six-pack ' of health and safety directives which we passed in 1992 . #% Cement works and part of the engineering industry would have been decimated . #% I sent a copy of Mr Fava 's report to a former staffer of mine , Sally McNamara , who is now the international relations director for a major Washington public policy institute , the American Legislative Exchange Council . #% Finally , given the comments made in the state-of-play document about the weakness of implementation of energy-efficiency legislation in the past , I would ask the Commission whether it can ensure that this directive is implemented fully and on time . #% It is important that we get this right , both for the sake of the people of Bulgaria and for our own citizens . #% Any switching of conventional production systems to organic will lead to a reduction in food supplies . #% I put this question down to the Council because it is a Member State Government that is failing to ensure good employment practice in major public institutions , namely universities and centres of higher education . #% I dusted my 1999 speech down , Mr Schulz left the Chamber after his speech , various other things remain just the same as they were seven years ago . #% In the UK alone it is going to effect 300 000 businesses , costing an estimated GBP 2 billion a year for SMEs alone . #% I underline the fact that neither the request for Commission posts , nor any of the Commission 's reform proposals , would cause a breach of the limitations set down under heading 5 of the 1999 financial perspectives and the Commission will fulfil the undertakings to stay within the limitations which we volunteered last year both to this House and to the Council . #% In Category 4 , the 10 % across the board cut - I am now speaking for Parliament before it has decided this - I would assume is absolutely unacceptable . #% And we need to be absolutely certain that we have licensing systems which carry obligations , and network benefits for passengers . #% Employment , particularly youth employment , is of course extremely important for both our young people and our economy . #% It should be remembered that these gases were already included , in 1997 , in the basket of gases to be controlled under the Kyoto Protocol and that this regulation emerged from a specific programme called the European Climate Change programme . #% I have to confess I get the impression that there is a certain degree of institutional territoriality here , particularly in the large Member States , where the trade and industry ministries are very reluctant to see the Commission continue to extend its scope in those new areas in WTO trade negotiations and , consistent with that , also reluctant to see the European Parliament increase its influence . #% Moldova , as a manifestly sovereign and European country , could one day join NATO and even the EU . #% We must ensure that appropriate provisions are in place . #% That means looking to see where we can reduce the burden of unnecessary regulation which adds costs to business and to see how far we can reduce the non-wage costs on business which , in turn , encourage companies to shed labour as the best way of saving large sums of money . #% We will have to return to these issues , and it is quite correct to orient the period of reflection towards them . #% These new challenges have been the subject of several reports to this Parliament : high rates of unemployment , an ageing population , the growth of social exclusion and persistent but changing inequalities between men and women . #% The lesson for Parliament , the Commission and the Council on transport matters is that in future we should be doing less , but doing it better . #% Many LDCs , such as Zambia for example , where I was recently , are still spending twice as much on debt servicing as they are on health and education . #% Such anomalies generate a sense of grievance amongst Europe 's citizens , not least my own constituents . #% If this applies to our own nationals , it seems only reasonable for those entitled to international protection to benefit from an equivalent entitlement if we are to avoid creating social exclusion , contrary to our own EU policy . #% There will always be people who are prepared to break the law , as they were at Parmalat , and no matter how wide-ranging and effective the scheme of regulation , whether it be for hedge funds or rating agencies or whatever else , we are not going to prevent that kind of criminal conduct . #% All of us therefore have to be more effective in curbing this trade . #% We want a strengthening of resolve to achieve the goal of a 70 % employment rate by 2010 , recognising the good progress we have seen and increasing the participation of unemployed people in active labour measures to at least 20 % in nearly all Member States ; we want to go further and set a new target of 44 % , the level in the three best-performing Member States , to be achieved within a five-year timeframe . #% However , this is not about what is in it but rather what is not in it . #% That is where we in this House have an exemplary responsibility in performing our role in the development of this particular sector . #% author . - Madam President , during times of economic downturn , it is only through the opening-up of markets and the removal of barriers that we can rebuild our industry , create jobs and boost development . #% The British market is unusual inside the EU in that it has been growing at a dramatic rate for many years . #% I offer my apology to Parliament . #% It rejects , however , most of Parliament 's amendments on social security and social protection rights , areas that we felt were crucial for interest groups , for students , teachers and others . #% The first is this : since this directive was first proposed , the whole furore across the European Union because of events in Austria and elsewhere , where the extreme right has come forward , has caused us , as a Parliament , with the widest possible across-party support , to work with the Council and the Commission to agree an accelerated timetable to enable this directive to go through to provide the strongest possible response to the racist and extremist threats that undermine our combined values . #% What we need now is a political commitment from the Member States not only to push ahead with Galileo , but to push ahead in a positive and determined way , working alongside the private sector . #% I urge you to support Amendment No 10 . #% - making clear Parliament 's intention to continue to monitor and scrutinise future developments in the ongoing Eurostat investigations and potential legal actions , with a view to further possible action #% It has been doing the job of coordinating air movements in 30 countries , half of them outside the EU , for 42 years . #% There are of course one or two areas of concern . #% Our first proposal is that the European Commission delegates in South Africa be given the power to authorize expenditure on projects up to a maximum ceiling of ECU 500 , 000 . #% If that is the case , perhaps Mr Barroso could tell me why he resigned the maritime portfolio shortly thereafter ? #% Was there any danger to the operators and the staff involved ? #% Similarly , I refute the argument that there is any danger to the language regime . #% But what do you preside over now ? #% These are not unimportant caveats . #% We should not forget what development actually means : it is taking people out of poverty , and we can achieve this by encouraging entrepreneurs to create wealth and jobs . #% I should like to propose that it is kept at one hour or , as a compromise , three-quarters of an hour . #% My amendment followed on from existing wording about training , and merely added that workers should be made aware of their own responsibilities for safety together with those of their fellow workers . #% Mr President , I wish to thank the Conference of Presidents for creating and sustaining this unique part-session . #% Similarly , on the issue of penalties for exceeding limits on late payments , I prefer the Late Payments Directive so as to avoid confusion . #% Let us please put an end to this nonsense . #% The macro-economic indicators have been very positive in Bulgaria . #% 
I had to modify my views on the subject -- which are quite liberal -- in order for a consensus to be reached , and I know Mr Liese has modified his views too . #% The hazards of using such chemical agents , must be assessed as to the risk for workers , not just from the immediate effects but the long-term effects as well . #% Would you like it to be a federal Europe with an elected government ? #% I do not blame the Committee on Budgetary Control but the individual committees which do not often take that responsibility . #% We had a situation where foot-and-mouth came into the European Union . #% I am most grateful to the Commissioner for that answer but we have learned in the last few days that it seems the WTO panel will find against the Commission on the complaint taken out by the USA on the issue of EU meat imports containing hormones . #% I have seen examples of 50 illegally imported young orang-utans found hidden in cramped cages in private Thai zoos . #% And , because it is a criminal law issue , it is a sovereign state matter , and it is up to the nation state to lead . #% The responsibility was soon traced to militant Islamic terrorist groups based in Pakistan , with full support and training from the Pakistani government , and also responsible for the earlier attacks in Srinagar against the Kashmiri State Assembly . #% I was elected on a Conservative Party manifesto to oppose fraud and maladministration . #% As other speakers have said , the polluter-pays principle must be the right one . #% We need to return to the issue of media concentration and how that relates to the public good , not just in terms of diversity but also in terms of raw political power . #% There has been an unscrupulous playing on the fears of their employees for their job futures . #% This derogation is due to expire on 31 December 2006 , and in a Communication from the Commission to the Council on 30 June 2006 , the Commission indicated it did not believe an extension to this derogation to be justified . #% I thank the Commissioner for her recent letter to me confirming that she will be taking similar action for high-speed international rail journeys . #% So it is hardly surprising that the No-dong I and No-dong II weapons which have a range of 1 300 kilometres have been sold to Iran , Syria and Pakistan or that the North Koreans are giving military aid to the Congo , Iran , Ethiopia and Syria . #% I shall speak later on the subject of Iraq but , while our attention is focused on that country , there are atrocious activities going on in other parts of the world . #% Thank you , Minister , for your first response during your presidency . #% If there is any racism , it is fairly small and , if it does exist , it is the fault of the victims . #% It was clear to me that they would be prepared to go further . #% When we talk about the no-fly zone , when we talk about the collateral damage , do not let us forget that point . #% It is time to face reality : one man 's job protection is another man 's unemployment . #% This rather begs the question : what is the coordination between the presidencies of the European Union ? #% I urge Members to think very carefully and support a sensible and realistic compromise text that will move the EU forward , will help Cuba and will help the world . #% I could end by saying the road to hell is often said to be paved with good intentions , but the health promotion case studies show that , as in North Karelia , if good intentions are translated into action , then the road can lead not to hell but to health . #% Suspension of agreements with those countries would follow if the clause was contravened . #% So in the next 20 minutes , when we meet as the Committee on Budgets , Members - because we are simple souls after all - will have the new budget presented in two formats : one in the ABB which we have insisted upon , and one in the old format which we can understand . #% They generally amount to about EUR 20 000 a year or EUR 5.4 million in total . #% Parliament 's objective in waste management strategy is not to constantly tighten rules on existing incinerating plant , it is to change the role of waste management , to change the type of waste management that we do . #% The situation of human rights in Cuba is by no means perfect and on some occasions the Cuban authorities have been their own worst enemies in refusing permission for representatives of the to travel to Strasbourg to receive their share of the Sakharov Prize recently . #% In fact it is only because of pressure applied at last night 's meeting by the PSE Group and the PPE-DE Group that he could be attending a meeting next week . #% If accomplished , this will prevent Britain from being able to embark on any independent military actions in the future . #% My group welcomes the sharper focus of the work programme and its grounding within a clear political strategy . #% To take one example , we face the challenge in the EU of stopping a rift opening up between the internet haves and the internet have-nots . #% Fourthly and finally , in terms of what Europe 's contribution can be within the framework of this particular initiative , I hope that governments , local authorities and those implementing taxes and charges can do so within a framework that is developed and integrated at a European level , and do it together . #% Where AIDS is concerned we face a vicious cycle of infection , incapacity and poverty alongside the 16 million deaths we have already seen : two million deaths a year in Africa , a quarter of all Africa 's deaths . #% Mr President , it is because the Lisbon Summit first of all set its sights on making Europe the most dynamic and knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 that we actually have the risk capital action plan we have today . #% Nothing is out until we vote on Thursday morning . #% The World Health Organisation describes mental health as a state of wellbeing in which the individual realises his or her abilities , can cope with the normal stresses of life , can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to his or her community . #% Four days ago it was reported that she was on hunger strike and that she was in a serious condition . #% Firstly , in regard to cabin crew . #% The UK requires a final five-year extension to address these issues . #% I want to centre my remarks on an issue already mentioned by other speakers , which is that if we want to be citizen-centred then we have to ensure that our citizens can make a complaint easily , perhaps via a one-stop shop . #% Mr President , I need no lessons in politics from MEPs who have been reported as singing a Horst Wessel song in the past . #% I think it is completely satisfactory for us that we have a period of review , that we have avoided the problems that we suspected in comitology and that , as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has said , we have been able to support and not needlessly challenge the opinion of the scientific committees . #% This only applies - as I understand - to animals excreting pathogens ingested with contaminated feed , not , as some newspapers inferred , from animals incubating or suffering from this disease . #% I do not have time to cover all the issues now but I want to point out in particular that it is very likely that the disease was caused by illegal imports of meat . #% Mr President , little new action on immigration and asylum will emerge from Seville . #% The authors of this report have laid an egg and I suggest they scramble it . #% Let us hope that in the next century we shall see something other than stories of Africa going backwards in terms of economic development . #% One of the priorities which has been identified under the Cardiff process is to improve the sensitivity of the financial markets to the value of intangible investments and investments in knowledge . #% That particular item was inaccurate , unnecessary and an aggravation to a country which is seeking to join us . #% UK Conservatives voted today against the Skinner Report , for the reasons given in my speech to the House the day before . #% Some of it is critical , but it is critical of what happened in the past rather than what is happening now . #% With the greatest respect to Commissioner Bangemann and Commissioner Van Miert , I would remind the Commissioners that they are appointed not elected and they should remember that , rather than even thinking of trying to overturn democratically decided policies . #% However , there is an even stronger argument in favour of voting in favour . #% So , all in all , we can be satisfied with the progress that has been made , even if the drafting on the points I made earlier could have been a little better . #% A good slice of the economy of a third world country is destroyed , all because EU fleets , due to their reckless rape of their own seas , now move on to other targets . #% This is particular true of rare genetic diseases that are hereditary . #% High prices for toothfish encourage still further this trend to fish in areas where controls are difficult . #% Indeed , I suspect that many of our colleagues are not as literate in technology as they should be , but that technology is going to have a huge effect on opening up the single market and we must make sure , first of all , that legislation does not restrict the ability of people to innovate and introduce changes and new forms of electronic commerce . #% Members who look at the titles of reports and think this is limited to agricultural matters ... #% in writing . - The current financial crisis has demonstrated the risks taken , and lack of capital held to cover those risks , by many banks . #% Even Mr Ciampi in his report on competitiveness said that public investment has a key role in stimulating private investment in Europe 's economy . #% We arrived in Cancún with an extremely overloaded agenda : ministers had enormous difficulty grappling with too many complex , unresolved issues . #% But the EU must now do more to alleviate the crisis by boosting financial aid to the surrounding Arab states , which have received the bulk of the refugees , in particular Jordan and Syria , and they have been particularly good at taking in the Assyrians . #% 
Mr President , I rise to ask whether you share my concern about the recent decision of the European Court of Justice in the Bernard Connolly case . #% All are so welcome and now they are to become our permanent brothers and sisters inside the Union . #% That work involves the networking of Community and national legal databases covering directives and national implementing measures and will also give the public easier access to Community law and assist with the training of lawyers in Community law . #% I know the rapporteur for the Schengen Information System is here today and I believe that , by cooperating in order to secure our borders and make sure that the information we have is used effectively , we will enhance the single biggest benefit of being a member of the EU , which is freedom of movement . #% The USA is such a strong partner that if the European Union can not speak with one voice - if not a common voice , perhaps a single voice , but at least a coordinated voice - then we will continue to fall behind in the transatlantic partnership . #% If it was not secret and we all knew about it , it would not serve the purpose for which it would be intended and necessary . #% I believe that this meeting -- the last under your chairmanship under the Presidency of the European Parliament -- will be a great opportunity for the Commission , the Council and Parliament to underline our commitment to giving the parliamentary dimension of the Mediterranean real substance . #% So where is the sustainability element going to come from ? #% Christian Democrats appreciate perhaps more than Liberals the idea of social solidarity in collective values and that there is such a thing as society which has a duty to support weaker individuals , yet when it comes to specific commitments in this area the Christian Democrats always seem to find reasons to vote against and , at best , just to resort to paternalism . #% At the time of the crime , especially personal , physical or violent crime , many victims , if not all , will be vulnerable , distressed , upset , probably angry , and desperately in need of support . #% Colleagues may recall this report came before Parliament at a particularly sensitive time for the Commission . #% That said , I should like to refer to Parliament 's and the Commission 's budget . #% Through the ` Make Poverty History ' campaign , millions have made their voices heard . #% There was very little time to consider . #% Mr President , on a point of order , while you are probably the best Vice-President we have in this Parliament , you have already made two mistakes today ! #% We would not want to be treated by a drunken doctor and I do not believe that we should be treated by an over-tired doctor . #% It has now gone 12.30 p.m. #% The `` souvenirs '' are drugs , home-made Kalashnikovs and home-made surface-to-air rocket launchers . #% If you look at our own history , public services have played a vital role in our economic development : they helped to end poverty and disease , and , by adopting the principle of universal access to public services , we managed to help eradicate poverty , raise living standards and create more equal societies . #% Mr President , so much has gone wrong on the phthalates issue that it is difficult to know where to start . #% Even if we can agree figures for category 3 in this declaration , do not take that as a sign of Parliament selling itself just for a small amount of money . #% in writing . - I am deeply proud to see the UK leading the work of the EU 's first naval ESDP mission , Operation Atalanta , with a British Commander at its head and its operational HQ in the UK . #% First of all , does it intend to convene a council or a special meeting to which the government representatives of the candidate countries would be invited , not only to facilitate the negotiations , but to give the important signal to the public that enlargement is not merely a political exercise , a mirage , a constantly distant objective , but that we are genuinely making the progress which is required ? #% The biggest foreign exchange market in the world - the biggest financial sector in the world - is in London . #% The truth is that cutting corners early on in the procedure ends up costing a lot more in administration , court time , lawyers and the cost of food and shelter . #% The only way we can hope to change the public 's perception of what we are doing here is not only to achieve better value for money but also to be seen to be doing it . #% As I have said before , our life is in their hands and it is important that we get this right . #% We know of the enormous pressure exerted on people by employers , by methods of working , by just-in-time production , by a whole set of things such as the macho work culture that says you are not dedicated to your job unless you are in at 8 a.m. in the morning and still there at 10 p.m. at night . #% I say to my Swedish colleagues and to the United States that they should be free to develop the drugs policies they think appropriate for their own nations , but that others should be free to develop their own strategies to explore more effective solutions to deal with this terribly difficult problem . #% Thank you , Commissioner Rehn , up to a point . #% Why is progress on ERTMS so slow and are we going to fail in our attempt to have the ECM scheme in place by the end of next year ? #% The US had 150 helicopters and a battle fleet on their way within hours , and the EU held meetings . #% To take a decision structure by structure would indeed create an unfortunate precedent , undermining the acquis communautaire , which is that the Commission takes part in all Council meetings and preparatory meetings . #% Greater transparency is the guardian of our security in this field . #% Madam President , in reference to Wednesday 's agenda following the point made by Mr Barón Crespo , last Tuesday I and two other Members of this House had the honour of meeting with the former king of Afghanistan , Mohammed Zahir Shah . #% If so , Commissioner , why was gender analysis so abysmally omitted from the Lomé Green Paper ? #% These reforms are necessary quite apart from the wider context of Agenda 2000 . #% Mr Esclopé sought to amend the report to take account of local public concerns and also to limit what is , I believe , the Commission 's unnecessary involvement in the day-to-day running of the COPE Fund . #% These provisions , as drafted , would make it almost impossible for an insurance company or bank to invest pension funds money in other financial institutions because of the harshness of the deductions . #% The European Union must formulate its own foreign policy , not supinely follow the United States , particularly when the United States is wrong . #% I rise in support particularly to plead to the Commission that it ensures that the port of Tilbury in my constituency is at the heart of this new increased trade . #% I am sure he is conscious of that dilemma and aware that any risk or threat to financial support could weaken the system even further , and that would simply exacerbate the problem we are dealing with . #% This arbitration outcome is essential . #% I will take the matter up bilaterally with her . #% I am pretty sure Parliament has a position now . #% I know that Mr Bangemann met Mrs Cresson and other EU ministers in October of last year in Paris , when this action plan was discussed in some detail . #% This is a good day for consumers and , despite the rather stunted debate we have had , we should shout that fact from the rooftops . #% That resolution contained in the final paragraph a reference to Michelin . #% I am in favour of recycling to the maximum practical level , but that is not enough . #% You do not find out that a chicken contains coccidiostats until it is dead and by then it is too late . #% But that is one of the best-kept secrets in Europe and in the developing world . #% Finally , when in section 4.3 the Commission says it will discuss CSR-related legislation with Member States , could she say which legislation she has in mind ? #% Mr President , the Socialist Group supported the compromise resolution on North Korea . #% This means including a fuller analysis of certain aspects of the initiative and also the winding up of the Joint European Venture , the JEV Programme , in its current form . #% We need at least informally to build a relationship with national parliaments and I will be taking steps in the next few weeks to do this , hopefully with colleagues from across the Chamber . #% It is essential that DG II - those people who are analysing the economic performance of European Union policies - are allowed to express their views directly to the College of Commissioners . #% However , this is a conflict which could have been avoided had the international community spoken with genuine resolve and made it clear to Saddam that it was united in its determination to disarm his regime with speed . #% Many of these were adopted in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , a move that has already helped to increase the pressure on the Commission and industry to push for further work on non-animal tests . #% There is much good work taking place , but no clear system set up to exchange research information . #% We all recognise the need for feed to be safe . #% Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the `` green line '' in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long . #% This has happened to the Mayor of my city , London , Mr Livingstone , who belongs to the Labour Party . #% Now it has emerged that during his hearing , Siim Kallas , who is in charge of the anti-fraud drive , gave deliberately misleading information and inaccurate dates , and used a misinterpretation as a means of shying away from a vital question . #% This only propagates a Green newsletter which is widely distributed , and which , if it were in the United Kingdom , would be libellous . #% That is not to say that , come our second reading , the figure may well be EUR 47.5 million but , for the sake of this debate and to clarify issues , our argument is that the Council put the wrong figure in : it should be EUR 30 million . #% However , may I say also that Emilia Müller has suffered one of the worst assaults by people outside this Parliament that any Member has had to put up with . #% 
There is no other North-South parliamentary assembly such as ours that has this opportunity to press on governance , democracy and human rights , and that is what we do . #% The surprise of this report is the fact that very few of these allegations are substantiated . #% The Commission will adopt the annual target for 2001 next month . #% While we pursue diplomatic solutions , we must not lower our guard but continue the military preparations that are necessary through NATO as well as our pursuit of a UN resolution that will give a legal basis for military action . #% Yet importantly , there clearly was a breach of competition rules on a massive scale . #% We would like to think that those who should be worrying are the disreputable ones who exploit the poorly-skilled , or people in areas of high unemployment who have little choice as to who they work for and under which conditions . #% We also need additional resources to promote the right of petition , especially in the new Member States , and to ensure that , where necessary , the Commission is fully willing and able to enforce the infringement process . #% The Committee has addressed some spurious issues put up by the industry , such as that of the possible health benefits from new products , which they said could be reclassified as pharmaceuticals . #% Mrs Péry mentions many of the things that could be done : improvements in the gear that is used , to allow many smaller fish to escape ; improvements such as inserting square-mesh panels in nets . #% There has to be an exhaustive search for a diplomatic solution . #% We support the belated stance of the England cricket team which has now refused to play in Zimbabwe . #% I am pleased to say that colleagues in my committee have agreed with the amendments and we have adjusted the report to reflect a continuation of what I did before , not the retrogressive views of the rapporteur in this instance . #% I would like to take this opportunity to also pay tribute to the remarkable work on this dossier that they have contributed and to that of my co-rapporteur , Mrs Maij-Weggen , and Graham Watson , Chair of the LIBE Committee . #% Building on the work of Labour MEPs , Tony Blair gained a great deal for Britain - and the North-West in particular - at the Berlin Summit . #% Commissioner Monti has today shown me a letter which shows quite clearly that the Commission did despatch the information and as publicly as I criticized them yesterday I should like to say today that I accept that without reservation . #% The whole committee wanted to express solidarity with the victims of this terrible disease and their families . #% That has been the focus for the last few months but what we need to do now is to find the causes of the widespread problems in the Commission and , more importantly , we want the Committee of Experts to recommend remedies . #% We should all remember that sanctions are sometimes better than the alternatives that we may have to consider . #% The essentials of the policy mix remain in place , and the compromise resolution which is tabled before us clearly sets out the steps we need to take in the weeks and months ahead . #% Once this decision had been taken in principle , it was Parliament 's purpose to make the best of what might be described , unfairly , as a dog 's breakfast . #% There will be no British cheque coming to any of you within a few years , but we have enjoyed ourselves whilst we have been here . #% It was a pity that the Lisbon conclusions did not call for a timetable . #% The status of President Allende as the democratically-elected head of government which he , General Pinochet , was pledged to uphold did not deter him from bombing the presidential palace , leading to the President 's death . #% Finally , with reference to the UN resolution , I agree that the arms embargo is of great importance . #% The detainees should also have immediate access to their families and to lawyers of their choice -- and I specify ` of their choice ' -- along with medical attention for those who need it . #% I am delighted also that we have reduced the level of cyclamates that can be used because of all our concerns about the exploitation of children and the way they now consume a variety of sweetened products . #% It is therefore essential to see rural development as support for the creation of a range of additional occupations in rural areas , not just those relating directly to agriculture and food processing , important elements though they will certainly continue to be in such areas . #% Well , we have changed the past and Europe is a different place from what it was in the post-war era . #% I draw your attention to Amendment No 11 , which is already out of date . #% We need common rules for working hours for aircrew and cabin staff , based not on costs but on safety . #% We can support the amendment from Mr Chichester to the effect that we can include military applications for peacekeeping purposes . #% It will enable the EU to mount a challenge to American anti-competitive rules . #% You will hear the same story repeated everywhere : too much red tape and too many rules , particularly those connected with employing people . #% Sadly our own Environment Agency does not appear to be up to the job yet . #% So could I ask you , Mr President , on behalf of myself and others , to request the Conference of Presidents to invite the Commission to make a statement on that basis . #% This is something which is bound to happen to almost all the animal livestock within the European Union and is happening now . #% All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly . #% Creativity is the engine of productivity in the European Union . #% The Council text is completely unacceptable to this House . #% The Council has eagerly legislated on the first with half a dozen laws and a thirty-page action plan on illegal immigration , but it has lagged on harmonisation for a common asylum system and integration of minorities and migrants . #% We must in future learn from what has happened in Bosnia where there is still no peace but only an absence of war . #% I have to agree with the honourable Member I am well aware of her particular point of view and her very supportive attitude towards both the employment strategy and the preventive approach . #% in writing . - I acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine , and note the unhelpful attitude of the UK Government on this important issue . #% I wonder whether it would be possible for you , as President , to write to the electors of Putney in London , pointing out that Sir James Goldsmith has hardly taken part in the proceedings of this House during the time he has been elected . #% But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe , then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report , because it will deliver those jobs , and it will deliver those opportunities , and it is the only way to do so . #% This legislation will go through to second reading well after the political pyrotechnics of Barcelona are long forgotten . #% Quite often , I know in the UK , it is used for bolstering government coffers . #% I most certainly am not a supporter of neo-liberal policies but the removal of trade barriers is a fact of life and the coming into force of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement has increased Mexican dependence on trade with the United States of America . #% It is only fair to point out that given the time we had to do this , the committee and the Parliament have worked as effectively and as quickly as we possibly can in what proved to be difficult circumstances so that the money could be released next year for this very important fund . #% That was a very full and helpful reply , Commissioner . #% We are talking about the problems of implementing the European Arrest Warrant in some countries because of fears that there are not minimum standards throughout the EU . #% Indeed , the President 's then indicative bracket of 0 % to 2 % as a reasonable inflation target seems to have been replaced by a yearning and a yen for monetary supply targets , if recent reports and pronouncements from Mr Duisenberg are to be believed . #% Furthermore , my report reminds the Commission of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme , which requests that the Commission identify and undertake specific actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from marine shipping if no such action is agreed within the International Maritime Organisation by 2003 . #% It is in nobody 's interest for the existing uncertainty to be continued . #% As long as the playing field is level and the procedure is absolutely transparent , such goals and choices can and should be valid , as the ECJ has recently confirmed . #% Madam President , it is perfectly understandable of course that the countries of Denmark , Sweden and Finland should be seeking to join the Schengen group . #% I should like to pass on her and my thanks to the Commission for focusing on this important issue . #% I hope that the economic and finance ministers will be similarly resolute . #% The lack of partnership ; I know this because I work in an Objective 2 area and I see these things happening . #% A new government is being formed in Kiev , but I am confident that whatever its composition , it will remain committed to European integration . #% In that process , I have to say to the Commission as an institution - and here I am talking to the last Commission - that it was very seriously deficient in the information that it gave both to Parliament and the Court of Auditors . #% Finally , I turn to Eurostat . #% In general I am always very sympathetic to the idea that Parliament should defend its rights and its position vis-à-vis other institutions . #% I have , on a number of occasions on a Friday , raised the fact that this sitting , which is often a very good sitting , is not televised . #% I therefore abstained on the final vote on the report . #% I would like to support , in particular , Amendments Nos 13 and 16 , 19 and 20 . #% 
This is a European Union increasingly active in its civilian role and far more present in the Middle East peace process . #% We have to decide as a European Union what we mean by sustainable economic growth and it is not what we are voting about here . #% Indeed , they are working for several , and not always in the same country . #% To that effect , we suggested the appropriations for staff should be put in the reserve . #% This is a very great bonus . #% Parliament and my committee are indeed determined to play their role , all the more so when we have been ahead in the thinking all the way along . #% I should like to remind both the Council and Commission that a restriction on access to documents can only refer to the exemptions listed in Article 4 and Article 9 , which in turn relate back to Article 4 . #% I am not accusing the Employment and Social Affairs Directorate-General of that , but there are forces elsewhere in the Commission that have that tendency . #% Can I also move on and say a couple of words about some of the amendments which have been proposed . #% As the House is aware , the Member States agreed to set up the agency ' s headquarters and general services in Thessaloniki . #% That is part of today 's agreement . #% Given that farmers have claimed for 6.5 million animals , I also reject the claim that 10 million were killed during the outbreak . #% I am sure that many of us would be very interested to know . #% The House has rightly debated these issues many times recently . #% Even if the Commission gets its own resources some time , which , on the basis of the votes earlier today , looks depressingly likely , the money spent by the Commission would still be money from taxpayers . #% Thank you for allowing me in with this question . #% Maybe , instead of telling the UK Government whom they can arrest and why , the parliamentary authorities could send her a map of the UK and some advice from our travel services as well . #% In addition , progress has been made between the European Commission and the Honduran authorities in a project which will assist young people at risk in Honduras . #% Equally , we are asking the Commission to come forward with some form of thought process . #% I hope , when the Commission replies , that the Commissioner will be kind enough to reply to the debate in English . #% I very much hope that in the ongoing negotiations Council and Commission will ensure that the issue of human rights and the protection of minorities is given the urgent priority it deserves . #% So there is still a great deal to do . #% The Rome Statute is flawed , as it would allow political mischief against American troops and political leaders . #% Here may I pay special tribute to my Spanish colleagues in the European Parliament , who have had many pressures on them from different families in Spain . #% The Commission has sent us a good communication , which I welcome . #% We have to consider the consequences for citizens who live close to pollution disaster areas . #% I hope that other Member States will take the lead in this and in other respects in putting this directive fully into practice , and show by example just what a commendable piece of legislation this directive will prove to be . #% Obviously , it would be a matter of great concern if someone , whose only offence is to be antagonistic towards an existing regime , were to be the victim of insufferable treatment . #% It would be nice , Mr President-in-Office , if you would listen to my contribution , because I would like to draw your attention to one particular issue on the economic side . #% Smuggled bushmeat could not only spark a new outbreak in Europe , it could also expose our livestock to diseases and epidemics on the African continent . #% Differences have also contributed to the fragmentation of the market for railway equipment . #% Mr President , it is clear that if EU law is to be credible it should be enforced properly . #% After much soul-searching in the Socialist Group we decided that we would withdraw that amendment in the interests of getting the largest majority possible in Parliament against the forces of racism , the extreme right and anti-Semitism . #% There is nothing undemocratic about that . #% I hope that our rapporteur will take note of these comments . #% That is the board that will meet in public and will make its opinions equally public so the citizens of Europe can see what it recommends . #% These are practical measures that will make a big difference in the short term . #% Today , that number is down to around 24 . #% Likewise in ICATT where scientists have reviewed fin to carcass ratios but have not recommended an increase of the fin to carcass ratio . #% I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer . #% There will be further discussions about it , but nevertheless I would not want this to go by without congratulating the Commission overall for the direction in which it is trying to take this . #% Pristina has , therefore , been chosen by the Commission as the location for the agency ' s headquarters . #% In contrast , the agreement of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs is a reasonable and proportionate response to fighting terrorism . #% We have strengthened the review provisions . #% Now we have to take this forward with the reforms of our health action programme that this report suggests . #% We welcome this report and look forward to it going through hardly amended . #% Member States are also largely responsible for the fact that the European Court of Auditors , in its a yearly reports , tells us that it can not trace all the accounts because of the way Member States spend the money . #% It is a shocking fact that over 100 000 people per year are estimated to die in work-related accidents in China . #% One wonders how many signatures and political groups would be required for the amendment to become acceptable . #% The Commission proposal does not specifically address the problems of air pollution in applicant countries ; and I think it is irresponsible , given the eminent enlargement , for Parliament not to be given any information regarding pollution levels in countries like Poland and the Czech Republic ; and the likely cost and time scale involved in bringing them up to exacting new standards . #% We are dealing with an evolving set of circumstances , and the technology is developing so fast that last years ' top energy-efficient appliance becomes next year 's rather mediocre model . #% In every legislative body or Council with which I have been associated , there are firm rules about what can be done and what can not be done . #% The overall objective of EU engagement is Libya 's full integration in the Barcelona process and subsequent progress towards an association agreement . #% Farmers need help now to get through to Christmas . #% I say to them that I have heard Member of Parliament after Member of Parliament line up and put forward arguments which are in the interests of the people of Europe , and Member of Parliament after Member of Parliament expressing sympathies with the underlying arguments that they are presenting . #% How do we determine that reality from the proposals of the Commission as well as of all the other institutions ? #% I have no right to second-guess scientists . #% This is very sloppy , very amateur and unacceptable as a way to treat this House . #% I should like to ask that we see it now so that we can make a positive contribution now in good time , rather than repeat the timing of the current report . #% There is much information already in the market ; we are not starting from scratch . #% We also need to bring forward the deadline for a passive house standard for residential and non-residential buildings across Europe . #% However , this must be viewed against the background of the fact that in both these cases , the Italian authorities -- the parliamentary authorities -- had come to the conclusion that in Italian terms Mr Bossi 's immunity should be waived . #% This fits well with our wider , better legislation agenda . #% We are spending far too much time here thinking about transitory issues of roaming . #% That is perfectly in order . #% In short , the bulk of immigrants seeking access to the European Union Member States are economic migrants . #% 
However , we must not abandon people who are hooked . #% In conclusion , I remind colleagues that there is one more very important report to come , my report on universal service , and many of the things you have talked about and , indeed , some of the provisions on mobile are actually more appropriate for my report and not for Mr Brunetta ' s. #% What we are looking at with Lisbon is that we have to beware that social cohesion , which was another of the goals , does not become a casualty of our search for competitiveness . #% As for free and fair elections , the problem in Burma is not free and fair elections - those took place 13 years ago - but that the military regime is not prepared to accept the will of the Burmese people . #% I realise that Mr Denktash is sadly still very unwell , but it must be possible to signal agreement on this plan as the basis for negotiation . #% There has to be respect for the rule of law . #% There needs to be a programme to ensure observance of minimum standards of due process , fair trials in criminal proceedings and approximation of rights of defendants . #% I believe I am right in saying that almost all major diseases , except possibly BSE , come from countries outside the European Union . #% He has to get tough . #% It is relatively simple and I advise the House to accept the amendment . #% It is all the more frustrating to watch these deadlines being missed - even applying the logic of their own commercial self-interest - as a particular sector in the US blocks progress in this field . #% I refer not just to the quality of Mrs Theorin 's work , for which I congratulate her , but the fact that this report was produced by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy . #% Does the President-in-Office accept , nonetheless , that the agreement made with Iraq by the United Nations Secretary-General has not led to any real increase in the level of imports of food and medical supplies , which are only at about a level of a third of the volume imported prior to sanctions , occasioning great hardship and many deaths which , of course , are partly the fault of the Iraqi dictator ? #% The Commission must take notice of this report , and that is why I have called for practical action to set up machinery to move towards a regionalised CFP according to a strict timetable . #% Legislators can not keep up with this technology even if they try to . #% Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria . #% The ECR Group has always defended the principle of subsidiarity and strongly believes that Member States should take the lead role in creating and driving employment legislation and social policy . #% The question is about strengthening cooperation between police agencies and coastguard services . #% There has been extensive evidence for this over a considerable period of time . #% One of these days there will be a puff of smoke , a loud bang and one of your Members will light up like a Christmas tree . #% We do not support the inclusion of the European Public Prosecutor in this text ( paragraph five ) . #% Again the message can go out tonight that by 2008 all categories of ships , if they want to come to a European port , must have a black box voice data recorder . #% However , what on earth can be wrong with asking manufacturers who make health and nutritional claims to give the scientific evidence for those claims ? #% By contrast , the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights -- a rather smaller fund aimed at the ex-Soviet Bloc -- which I had the honour to set up a few years ago , amounts to only EUR 106 million . #% One wonders what planet Herr Brok lives on . #% That is why we have to get a very large majority for this report tomorrow . #% Our hope is that this report , when adopted by Parliament tomorrow , will serve as a clear signal of our political backing for a comprehensive round at a crucial stage in the preparations for Seattle . #% In fact I am sure the Council and the Commission will say that the reports actually violate the Financial Regulation . #% But there is room for the Commission to coordinate and improve evaluation systems as provided for in the Treaty and I was glad to see that the Commission was careful to emphasise that this is to be based on voluntary cooperation between the Member States . #% That is a principle which is , and should remain , at the heart of the legislation we adopt in this area . #% It is as fundamental as that . #% A third area of concern which was addressed in the opinion of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy was that of the Scandinavian countries in particular over multiple classes of shares . #% I turn now to the future financing of the Union . #% I am slightly perturbed that it seems to be taking so long to get this matter addressed . #% The Commission has responsibility to exercise those powers which it has quite clearly and lamentably failed to exercise up to now . #% Forty years after the Treaty of Rome it is not good enough that we are dividing families in this way . #% I would like to know whether the guidelines legally constitute a common position . #% That is the ` hole ' . #% Would the new measures be taken any more seriously ? #% The day of the French referendum , 29 May 2005 , is not even a minor detail for him . #% I hope after the vote in this House tomorrow the Commission will maintain its position . #% The report has constructive ideas . #% But I was surprised last week to receive a visitor in my office in Brussels who spoke about people in Bulgaria receiving visits from the secret service in their homes at night . #% In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment . #% I do not say that in any spirit other than one of sympathy and - to use the word that the President himself used today - solidarity with any country anywhere which finds itself affected by BSE in the way that we in the United Kingdom have been . #% We have to recognise the facts of life and we have to keep families together , particularly if we want to have the sort of economy that we feel we are entitled to . #% Does the Presidency-in-Office accept that the British Government , in some four months ' time , will be coming back , trying to point to achievements during its period of holding the Presidency of the European Union ? #% Commissioner , you have got an impossible job . #% He and I sometimes cross swords on the issue of other nutritious additives , but in this case we are looking very much at the essence of the burden of proof before this list is yet further extended . #% Anything less from this Parliament would be an abdication of our responsibilities and a total abandonment , not only of the people of Galicia , but of the whole population of the European Union . #% Lastly , we should be very careful how we use the precautionary principle because that can be dangerous : used correctly , it is a good thing but if it is used to justify actions for which there is no scientific basis , in politically motivated campaigns , it is a very dangerous principle . #% I am encouraged by the commitment to greater cross-border activity , but I remain very doubtful about the way in which TACIS is currently being used . #% We make the Palestinians jump through hoops , but we let the Israelis get away with bloody murder . #% We believe it is time for the Commissioner to get tough on drunk drivers and drink driving , to come forward with a directive to reduce the limit to 50 mg . #% History is littered with a whole series of pointless wars but this particular one must be one of the most pointless wars in hundreds of years . #% I particularly want to single out the fact that for the first time we have a specific requirement on Member States to promote the single market in relation to their businesses , to encourage businesses to take advantage of the single market in the services sector and go out and trade crossborder . #% After unification , there was a considerable improvement until the vicious war of April-July 1994 , in which the former leadership of the South was ousted . #% I still think there is a problem in the last sentence , but I am sure the services can also rectify that . #% We now understand much more clearly that this is not the case and that very often the defects in a particular product begin to manifest themselves over the lifetime of the individual concerned . #% He has made history as well , by having the first report to go through under codecision and the first report on health and safety . #% Given the great concern in the UK about health services , one comparison might be with the cost of health provision . #% They know it is degenerating and they know that research that might help them is being carried on , often involving stem cells . #% In the past five years , the European Parliament has twice awarded the Sakharov Prize to Belarusian dissidents , and others have been shortlisted . #% Earlier this month , Terry and two colleagues were kidnapped by two hooded men with machine guns and later their bullet-ridden bodies were found dumped across the Venezuelan border - the murder of one 24-year-old who believed in the defence of human rights . #% I must extend my gratitude to Mr Wijsenbeek for raising that point of order when he did . #% I would particularly cite the example of the allocation of the funding which does not even meet the Commission 's intention to give particular consideration to the Cohesion Fund countries . #% 
Mr Nassauer 's report on Europol has the balance right . #% While we are debating and voting on the report tomorrow , over a thousand Europeans will die for no good reason . #% Details relating to these matters and to Mr Harbour 's questions on benchmarking , appraisal , management and pensions are available in the progress report which I am circulating to the House today . #% Mr Barroso , you try and keep bleeding the British taxpayer at this rate , because worse is better and on that basis this corrupt institution is doing very well indeed . #% I represent many Chinese exiles in London and I am pleased to offer what small support I can by speaking out on behalf of Mr Liu and their democratic aspirations . #% Enlargement of the EU entails simultaneous enlargement of the EEA in order to safeguard the homogeneity of the internal market . #% However , I have to sound a note of caution . #% If further regulation is needed , we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive . #% There are a couple of positive things that I want to draw your attention to , because we also need to make sure that access in its widest sense really is available . #% There are many activities which are criminal in some countries but not in others . #% It is still very early in the day to know that but the fact is that we have been able to find : enlargement , stability and security , and the sustainable inclusive economy . #% This extra time has certainly been necessary . #% Such a delay in fostering closer political and economic ties with Russia would merely be a gift to anti-western , communist and nationalist forces in Russia , as has been mentioned during the debate . #% It is a key component in the battle to keep us safe , not just in the air , but on the ground . #% I apologise for interrupting the debate , but before it began Sir Robert Atkins rose on a point of order which you ruled to be out of order because it did not concern the business of the day . #% I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal , which was very well-balanced , stand unamended . #% The first change is to the banking directive which provides for exchange of information with non-banking supervisory authorities in third countries . #% Mr President , given the importance of the directive on national emission ceilings to this report on a proposal for a daughter directive , it is a little surprising that the order of debate is as it is , because without reduction in the key trans-boundary pollutants we are not going to reduce ozone . #% Neither do we want unelected commissioners who hide their murky involvement in the corrupt use of public money , tax evasion and bribery . #% What I find most absurd is that I can fly into Europe with duty-free liquids - alcohol , perfume or food bought outside of the EU - but should I transit to another plane within the EU , it will be confiscated by the authorities . #% They actually feel threatened by the potential loss of sovereignty that it implies . #% There is almost a religious belief that these institutions can deal with the world 's problems , so much so that one or two speakers here think that the Berlin Declaration may even be able to control the weather in the future ! #% You think that , if you have a fund of say a billion euros , all will be well . #% I am pro-European but we bring forward more and more legislation without demonstrating the actual need for it . #% If you say no to this question , how can you reconcile that with the answer that Mrs Delmas-Marty gave our committee a month ago ? #% I have no doubt that the parliamentary elections on 6 March , although far from perfect in terms of media bias in the run-up and the monopoly of administrative resources , will not be subject to the kind of fraud seen under Prime Minister Yanukovych in neighbouring Ukraine , which sparked off the famous Orange Revolution . #% The Commission wants the competition authorities to form a network at the centre of which is the Commission . #% For instance , under the regulations being framed in this directive , if you have an old boat with an old polluting engine , it is perfectly legal provided you do not replace it with a slightly newer possibly even cleaner engine of a greater power rating . #% According to Eurobarometer 66 % , that is two out of every three European citizens , want more information . #% I do not understand your assertion that there will be no transfer of powers . #% Insofar as the Parliament budget is concerned , we support those colleagues who have criticised the Administration for trying to suppress the EP-rom study . #% If we take the corrected version of the original then indeed the three amendments are identical and can be voted as one which would be the best solution . #% Colleagues who have spoken are right that the future of the UN is at stake . #% That essentially is what we have here . #% Some said that for every item coming before this House there should be a detailed examination of the budgetary implications by the Committee on Budgets . #% This power was given to the Court of Auditors by the Maastricht Treaty and this is the second time the Court of Auditors quite rightly and properly has not been able to give us that statement of assurance . #% The West might have done better to have paid the teachers , doctors and miners directly , perhaps . #% The EU development policy statement is now the appropriate vehicle for us to move this forward and to show that we firmly believe in the need to rebuild , in Europe and elsewhere , that strong sense of unity , purpose and action . #% Politics and fishing just do not mix . #% The only arguments against it are : firstly , it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world , in East Asia , Europe and Latin America . #% They all remained adamant throughout that there was a great deal of post-Uruguay Round unfinished business - on textiles and agriculture in particular - that needed to be addressed . #% Because for us it entrenches many of the problems we have been fighting in our own Member States . #% This is all about enlargement by the back door . #% Now in this country , four fifths of which - ironically - is Saharan desert , we have the catastrophe of flooding in Algiers with the death toll in flash floods rising towards 1 000 as the grim task of sifting through the mud and the rubble goes on . #% I would therefore like the summit to be able to set out an ambitious agenda , a vision of how these remaining obstacles can be reduced and removed , to have a route map , to be able to have a clear timetable so that we would be able not only to stimulate our economies , but to bring Europe and America closer together . #% Mr President , it is more than two years since I started working on this directive and I have been convinced from the beginning that its objectives and the ambition to tackle the barriers to the internal market for services have been absolutely right . #% We also look forward to the stocktaking social reality document , which is extremely important as regards benchmarks of wellbeing . #% The fact that the IGC has failed makes the process and the outcome of the Convention more attractive . #% We look forward to a directive next year . #% If we get it right , it should be a mutual benefit . #% There are two other things in the report I would like to highlight . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , this proposal has been another plank in the attempts to impose EU ideals and censorship on an unsuspecting public . #% I thank the Commissioner , whose work as Governor of Hong Kong ensured the continuation of the democratic life of that territory , which I hope will spark changes in the wider China . #% We need , at the end of the day , to ensure that we end up with a sensible , balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost . #% I challenge Miss Gill to tell us whether she makes use of Parliament 's private health reimbursement scheme and whether or not she benefits from Parliament 's voluntary pension scheme . #% The sanctions for non-compliance are also critical . #% These crime-busting measures must be implemented from Blackburn to Barcelona . #% If this is not to be mere rhetoric but a practical effort to offer Europeans the best possible quality of life , the public 's demand for wholesome , safe food at an affordable price is one area where the EU Institutions would do well to act visibly . #% I want to ask three things . #% This amount is twenty times higher than in Europe and an amount that represents approximately half of the overall research and development investment gap between the US and Europe . #% I welcome the work done by my colleague Mrs Weisgerber on the access to repair information . #% Despite the many positive aspects of the report , I will vote against in the light of the above comments . #% We therefore welcome this report as its findings are indeed serious . #% I should briefly like to mention a point made by some of my colleagues from that delegation . #% Let us have flexibility , but let us set deadlines . #% The myriad of arrangements on judicial and police cooperation between national officials -- not eurocrats , let us note -- need to come within the ambit of parliamentary scrutiny , as do the activities of the Anti-Terrorism Coordinator . #% 
Now they have joined the EPP-ED Group . #% This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of , and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often . #% There are therefore concerns about the position of lawyers . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their excellent reports , which cover interim agreements and partnership and cooperation agreements with the three Transcaucasian states of Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia and the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan . #% For two years the EU was the only place in the world that had a human rights dialogue with a deeply unloved regime in North Korea . #% It is all very well for us to come forward with proposals , but we should have regard as to how such proposals are to be financed . #% Therefore we must recognise that there are widely different opinions honestly held in this House . #% Let us not underestimate the scale of the task that we face . #% I hope that the Commission will comment on the feasibility of this . #% The proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as ` ultra light ' and ` low tar ' . #% We are right to prioritise the research needed . #% It seems that something which has at last changed is the Council and Commission 's willingness to take firm action . #% Also , a three-year review allows for the European Commission to consider whether legislative proposals covering this area could be useful to reduce further any need for such testing . #% Mr President , I thank the Commission for that response but I did raise the issue of the elements of the support package for the BLNS countries on which it was promised that a conference would take place in Lesotho . #% Essentially , we are looking for some shape of strategy and for key issues requiring a political input , so that we can then leave the technical side to the Commission . #% That is why I would ask you , Commissioner , between now and next year 's annual economic report and broad economic guidelines to fight to defend what the Commission and the Essen summit agreed , namely to support the Delors and Santer initiatives on borrowing at European level to help boost investment levels . #% ACP countries need training and their workforce needs to be improved ; they need improved infrastructure , transport and institutional capacity-building . #% There are going to be new provisions for superstructures . #% May I say at this point that the central conclusion of Mr Spencer 's report on Russia , namely that we must postpone agreement on a common strategy beyond the Cologne Summit in June , is - and I think many agree here - diplomatic lunacy . #% My information is that the temporary work sector in the Netherlands has declined since their domestic law changed . #% None of those four pillars will make a significant impact on unemployment in the short term . #% In our Amendment 2 we focus on a couple of issues highlighted by the Employment Task Force -- the Kok report -- namely adaptability and lifelong learning . #% As no other legal basis on access to documents is provided in the Treaty , the regulation on Article 255 will be the framework for all other secondary legislation and for the internal rules of the institutions , which should be in conformity with it . #% The ECR Group have , however , along with the EPP , signed a resolution calling for enhanced cooperation between Member States , police and border control agencies where personal data can be safeguarded and where the care of a victim can be decided by individual Member States . #% As a member of the Committee on International Trade , I believe very strongly in this and we welcome the 2006-2015 reforms to the Generalised System of Preferences . #% Let me remind you of a few examples . #% There are some parts I do not like , such as for instance paragraph 13 which promotes tax coordination . #% Health and safety is not the most popular pastime in the European Parliament , but within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs Mr Correia has spent some time developing what I hope will be a future career in this area . #% The environmental and social effects of the liberalisation of the energy sector , for example , are sustainable issues . #% Mr President , my group certainly welcomes this report and will not be supporting the alternative resolution . #% In time , I am confident that consumers not just in Britain but throughout the EU will recognise this fact and actively search out British beef . #% As my colleague Mrs Korhola has said , there is more and more evidence that suggests that these highly intensive active sonars pose a very major threat to marine mammals and to fish . #% We could not support Amendments 1 and 2 to split the Regulation ; 93 and 94 to reduce funding for Asia and increase funding for Latin America ; 3 , 18 , 56 and 97 on benchmarks and a Bi-Regional Solidarity Fund for Latin America ( creating a cumbersome and wasteful extra layer of bureaucracy ) ; or 18 , 28 , 29 , 56 , 57 , 95 , 96 , and 99 which create a rigid framework for programmes intended for poverty reduction . #% As Mr Cashman explained , we question whether Amendment No 17 from the Verts/ALE Group it is admissible , and I welcome the fact that Mr MacCormick was doubtful about that . #% Consequently , the Member States will not receive ten billion back , but something in the region of EUR 5.5 billion . #% For too long families in these enclave communities have been deprived of their human rights and deprived of the right to education . #% Surely it is right that we take the time to complete the period of reflection and try first to save the Constitution -- or most of it -- before calling for a two-speed Europe and going down that road . #% Furthermore , companies would simply relocate and continue producing . #% I had asked about the development of the single European market , in which three of the four freedoms are a danger , in my belief , to children . #% That was a compromise . #% Russia , however , is fortunately now making some moves towards punishing those responsible for some of the atrocities . #% It lays on special chartered aircraft in order to deport them en masse and there is no follow-up to see what happens to them when they get back to their countries of origin . #% The Commission needs both commitment and resources to tackle that work . #% More recently my visits have largely centred on nuclear issues . #% Of course they have been put forward by political groups , but surely it can not be an acceptable situation that somebody can be elected vice-president when a majority of people in Parliament do not wish them to be elected . #% I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets acknowledges this . #% Going forward , surely we should look to be more flexible in our application of GSP + , perhaps as an alternative to the EPAs . #% Indeed , the very future of that sector depends on our commitment today to the conservation of stocks . #% We will try to ensure that no such mistake ever happens again , but the way we voted did not represent our actual position on amendment 1 . #% The no-fly zones are in support of Security Council Resolution No 688 which demanded an end to his brutal repression . #% Equally , I must urge our leaders to ask themselves a simple question before they go to Copenhagen . #% We can not allow the Arctic to become the new arena for Russia 's expansionist tendencies . #% I hope the Commissioner will tonight confirm her agreement with the UN Commissioner for Human Rights that her office in Colombia retain the double mandate , including monitoring , not restricting its duties to simply technical assistance . #% Mr President , with these hearings we have just carried out an exercise in scrutiny and transparency the like of which exists in none of our Member States . #% We have to recognise that those monsters exist and I am not sure that we do in this particular resolution . #% I have submitted a minority report which sets out the chronology of the action taken in the United Kingdom since 1986 . #% The single European market in new issues of shares and bonds is set to become a reality . #% It is sad for Europe that it has actually needed the stimulus of the `` knowledge economy '' to realise what has been clear for the last decade or more , that our economy is not adequately geared towards encouraging those small entrepreneurs to come into the market , to take the risk to set up new businesses . #% We need to be clear about not being seen as a ` nanny state ' . #% If back-end costs are not calculated properly , then nuclear-generated electricity appears to be much cheaper than it really is . #% We also believe we have made minimal progress on deadlines - although that is something that rests with the Member States . #% Will he undertake with the SVC to examine the problem of long-range , unrecorded animal movements in which animals are largely treated as commodities , which has been the major factor in the spread of FMD ? #% It will be a sad day for Britain , its people and its economy when the likes of Slovenia and Lithuania , Estonia and Malta adopt the Euro , while Britain languishes on the sidelines adrift from the world 's most successful currency , tossed to and fro by a Eurogroup making decisions vital to our economy , but independent of our input and indifferent to our interests . #% It is important that whatever we bring forward , real action is taken and that action is monitored and evaluated . #% They should not be opposing close economic integration with Mexico , Canada , which will inevitably accompany globalisation , but rather demand its democratisation through the creation of a NAFTA parliamentary assembly to promote a social dimension . #% It is my opinion that we spend far too long in the contradictoire procedure between the Court of Auditors and the Commission . #% 
Neither the procedure itself nor the legitimate expectations of this democratically-elected institution have been met in the way the procedure has been used so far . #% We would therefore be fairly apolitical and once those issues had been clarified , we would ask for the money to be released for the other posts . #% However , we as a Parliament are still waiting for OLAF 's report on Eurostat . #% I do not believe that any of them were Members on this occasion . #% As the Commissioner has also said , the other imperative for change has been the enlargement of the European Union , which has meant an increase in the Board of the Agency from 48 to 78 and has therefore necessitated a streamlining of administrative and management processes . #% It seems that the former Soviet Union is dumping wood at ridiculously low prices simply to get foreign exchange . #% We have pushed forward the issue of developing Pakistan 's economy which , I believe , was an important step in ensuring that we will see further democratisation in Pakistan , further work towards the development of human rights , and fulfilment of the demands made in our second resolution which I was happy to support . #% We want to make that message as loud and clear and unequivocal as we possibly can . #% I do not think that was modest , and yet we are accomplishing it . #% Mrs Jackson asked you as the very first question if we have another committee to look at our food safety across the European Union will that actually be better than the present standing committee and will people take any notice of it . #% But it is wrong to see it simply in those terms , because there is more to it than that . #% As Mr Coleman of DG SANCO stated in a letter he wrote shortly after that : ' A clear majority of experts from the Member States have expressed the position in both the Commission and the Council working parties that the reduction to 350 mg/l is not sufficient , and wish to go further . ' #% In the next few years we will need to think of how the European Union can really make an impact on the global stage , as a partner rather than a rival of the United States . #% I accept that is not Mr Coveney 's personal intention , but we wish to see that wording withdrawn to avoid any confusion . #% I have tabled amendments accordingly . #% In fact , it is a position in which I too find myself to some extent . #% Beyond this , there is an important objective point which I remember from my time at Harvard University , and it is this : decisions that are made without transparency and no proper public scrutiny have a built-in tendency to be bad decisions . #% I believe any action that is necessary should be taken at that level . #% Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets . #% Meanwhile , two thousand people in the last year have needlessly , unnecessarily lost their lives because the Commission would rather talk than act . #% Of course the Stability Pact is wrong . #% All Member States must change the balance of the IMF and World Bank to ensure that any financial restructuring does not threaten public funding for healthcare and education , which are closely linked . #% The Conservative Party , in the form of Mr Chichester , is yet again inviting the European Union to meddle further and deeper in Britain 's affairs . #% . Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Magri for his speech . #% Earlier on today we were debating the budget for next year and the difficulty of the European Union finding sufficient finance to fund the operation in Kosovo . #% But it seems that the Commission is voluntarily giving up the right to support its SMEs . #% That would give us a strengthened common position delivering additional safeguards . #% The third issue relates to this idea of budgetary consolidation . #% There is also the question of corruption in the energy sector . #% I recall my colleague Olivier Dupuis , a former Member of the European Parliament , being arrested in Laos and going on hunger strike because of the inability to distribute material in that country . #% While thanking the Commissioner for his answer , I do not accept that it is true that as long as Congress in the United States refuses to agree to the waiving of Titles III and IV , no real progress in implementing the basis of the agreement can be put into effect . #% I am pleased at the range of measures that he has outlined . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Paulsen , my colleague on many food safety deliberations , for the work she has done on these complex regulations . #% I am certainly grateful for his ready acceptance of some of my own amendments , for example that a key strand of consumer policy must be the maximisation of consumer choice , that the completion of the single market is therefore a priority for consumers and not just business , that the package travel directive should be included as a priority for a review , and that countries that flout consumer protection laws should be more rapidly and thoroughly penalised . #% Mr Toubon and his friends propose that Turkey be brought into a privileged partnership enjoying some aspects of membership , but without political representation and without the duty to respect European law and the principle of loyal cooperation . #% He made a couple of applications , one of which was for a job in the Commission . #% The EU is in a delicate position as the last major WTO player not to have concluded a deal with China . #% Secondly , no attention was given to the bunker-fuel oil spills or the pollution caused by hazardous and noxious substances . #% Indeed , at the moment before the English High Court there is a case of alleged breach of statutory duty against Her Majesty 's Treasury and the Secretary-of-State for the Department of Trade and Industry . #% These issues are important to charities across the United Kingdom including places like Chipping Barnet , in my own constituency . #% Mr President , the starting point for this debate was the US rejection of the Kyoto Protocol . #% At times it seems it is like an ostrich with its head stuck in the sand trying to ignore all the problems around it . #% It is for that reason that I am voting to support the recommendations of the Feio report , which highlights the need to strengthen EU economic provisions and to review and improve them in the longer term . #% There can not be a pick-and-choose system . #% However , the bank rescue in the UK was less swift than it might have been because of the consequences of EU competition policy . #% I have just this minute been informed that my letter to the General Secretary of the Labour Party on this matter has in fact been answered . #% Thirdly , does not the US draft agreement state clearly that the parties expressed their intention to investigate and prosecute war crimes and , therefore , achieves the objective we wish to see ? #% The more people there are , the more sophisticated they become , the worse that pollution potentially gets . #% Palestine is not yet a state competent to have its own trade agreements , which , controversially , the EU ratified in 1994 . #% As the Socialist coordinator let me say that the group will be supporting the report as it stands with the amendment from the Committee on Budgets which was voted on last night concerning the extra upgradings for the ad personams . #% Indeed , in future we will need to be even more fully involved in our societies . #% Both sides can be satisfied if my amendment is adopted because it says that Parliament will ` examine ' a proposal for such a system in time for the 2009 elections but would not make it legally obligatory now by inserting it as a requirement in the act . #% Linguistic skills are certainly important for labour mobility . #% I am dismayed that protests in Western Sahara have been met by a violent clampdown by the authorities and I share the fears expressed in this resolution for the safety of Sahrawi human rights defenders . #% In these circumstances , absolute clarity is required and for that reason we believe that the five plus one option , with a reinforced accession strategy for all applicant states , is the right way forward . #% Today a lawyer for some of the remaining British detainees has described the stance of the UK Government as craven . #% I know how much the Council , and in particular its Working Group on Human Rights , values the contact and cooperation which is being established with that subcommittee . #% I too am concerned for the welfare of small children , but based on reasoning and science , not on emotions . #% It gives them the assurance that they will be able to create new works and to get fair rewards . #% So it is astonishing that neither the OSCE Summit declaration nor the Helsinki conclusions make any reference to the Kurds . #% I occupy room 238 in IPE 2 , from which I normally have the pleasure of observing the French countryside . #% I urge them to free Dr Than and Aung San Suu Kyi , and all other political prisoners immediately and to give their people hope for the future . #% Obviously there is some inconsistency here : the Commission quite rightly is planning to tackle the appalling toll of road accidents across our continent - 50 , 000 lives are lost each year - and yet at the same time the powers we already have to prevent accidents involving coaches , lorries and buses are clearly not being enforced throughout the European Union . #% It is an essential piece of the jigsaw whose final picture is to be a superior rights regime fostered by the Court of Justice and enjoying the external supervision of the Court at Strasbourg . #% It was a terrible mistake that , right at the end of the negotiations , the Council actually offered us the chance to incorporate hormone disruptors - endocrine disruptors - within the socio-economic categories - the substitution categories - and we as a Parliament declined and settled for a review in six years ' time . #% The Commission rightly wants to improve the situation . #% 
I say this at a time when , yet again , the European Commission 's procedures in this respect have been the subject of serious criticism and , as in the Palestine Authority area until recently , the issue of proper control of funds appears to have been largely avoided by the international community . #% Accidents have happened and accidents , of course , will continue to happen . #% This demand will not go away any more than the demand of Mr De Rossa 's Irish compatriots for Guinness will go away , wherever they are based . #% The exemption of children 's and sports shoes has the effect of excluding around 42 % of footwear imported at dumping prices , yet for which dumping duties will not be paid . #% In my own constituency , in Basildon , European ADAPT funding is currently being used to appoint a town centre manager to combat the drain of shopping to out-of-town centres . #% We should ensure that one staff member in every Commission delegation , in 118 countries worldwide , is responsible for reporting and promoting human rights obligations . #% It is time for this Parliament to start addressing the issues which are of concern to the citizens of Europe and to stop addressing itself to detailed questions where it can be of no assistance in actually securing worker protection . #% Alan Johnston 's kidnapping is the radio silence that now must come to an end . #% If ever there was a case that ` justice delayed is justice denied ' it is in the field of licensing and interconnections currently going through the conciliation process . #% There are two separate amendments here . #% Phasing-in can not be achieved satisfactorily without an adjustment of the structural fund implements and without an increase in the resources , greater participation of the partners in decision making and much more clearly focused measures . #% Their comments are sometimes surprising ; they are objecting for instance to the fact that funding can be cut off for parties that do not respect the principles on which the European Union is founded , namely -- -- and this is laid down in the legislation -- -- the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law . #% Sound-bite television has not been helpful to public understanding of this complicated disease - as you may have experienced a few moments ago , Commissioner . #% If we choose tight protection for our citizens we should not allow the exporting of more dangerous products which profit from the addiction of others . #% I come from the last Member State to have introduced proportional representation for European elections and am glad that this will now be recognised as a principle to be applied across all Member States . #% That is our first duty and we should discharge it . #% If it is feasible to establish practices in the European institutions on the basis of practices in the country in which an EU official is employed , we will try to introduce that change which could extend certain rights of registered couples , whether homosexual or heterosexual . #% There has been an effective moratorium in place since then with the result that 53 people who were defined as subject to what we would call cruel and inhuman punishment , have had their cases put on one side . #% In the west of Scotland the route from Gourock to Dunoon is twenty times as far by road as it is by sea and that from Tarbert to Portavadie is twenty five times as far . #% So , could you please tell us what steps you have taken to ensure that we have trouble-free travel next time ? #% Mrs Malmström said that the Cubans have a right to democracy . #% We look back into the history of the European Union over the last generation and the continent of Europe over the last century . #% If we fail to allow this , we exclude the most disadvantaged people from our work in the European Union . #% First , let us understand the inconsistencies within European development programmes because of the geographical distribution of responsibilities within the Commission . #% Neither of those things is very likely to happen . #% Mrs Dührkop , when she was the rapporteur , likened the harmonious relationships to a symphony being played on a grand piano . #% We have had external events such as the floods and we want to know how these will affect next year 's budget . #% All these organizations are committed to nurturing small and medium-sized companies . #% I took the opportunity of looking at the list of speakers in this debate and I see that the overwhelming majority are from southern Member States . #% That means that we now have a yawning gap in our international arrangements and the EU again must apply pressure to move this forward . #% This misconceived aspiration is further underlined in the statement that EU accession constitutes ` an accession of a non-State Party to a legal instrument created for States ' . #% There were four areas in which we sought assurances . #% What ideas and proposals have you got to continue the process of integration into subsequent EU presidencies ? #% I congratulate the rapporteur on his patience . #% I am fairly relaxed about this , but it would be much more sensible , since we are teed up to vote on this and we are unlikely to change our opinion on the actual voting - plus , minus or abstention - in the light of the recast procedures , to vote now when we have the time rather than hurry and add this vote to the list tomorrow when we have a lot of other things to do . #% We also share parliamentary and public concern about what realistically seems to be the terrorist bombings in Moscow and , as recently as this morning , in Volgadansk . #% Honesty and transparency have been sacrificed to expedience . #% It is the tariff barriers : bring those down , trade improves and most people in Africa will be able to make a living without moving home . #% To come to this final conclusion is an enormous satisfaction for all of us . #% This side of the House and this committee shall continue to do that . #% Five per cent for the environment : that means that 95 % of the money could be harming our natural resources , and that is not good enough . #% But it seems to me an amazing coincidence that police raids against MED TV occurred simultaneously in London , Brussels , Sweden and Moscow on 18 September if there was no common origin for their action and if this was not provided by the Turkish authorities . #% The European Parliament has itself made a strong call for the extension of a ten-year-old existing directive to cover non-financial activities and professions . #% We can not have Fair Trade on the cheap . #% We must also have more and better security . #% It seems to me that the main priority for the ACP is not just about how they maintain administration of ACP aid , but how they maintain ownership of their own priorities and their own development strategies . #% We hope to carry them out thoroughly and quickly , as Commissioner Kinnock forwards them to us . #% The bias and manipulation of the trial and the accused were a travesty of any sense of justice . #% Since it is late and there are few of us present I can be short and brutally frank . #% The important thing is : will the EU guarantee peace ? #% Now at least we have a document , although I have to say that it is rather thin soup . #% No doubt huge pressure will be put on the plucky Poles and others to ensure a signing ceremony on 9 May 2004 . #% Yet what we have in front of us is a regulation with a legal base that casts doubt on the ongoing right of Austria and Denmark to keep their stricter national laws beyond six years and that will actively work against the ability of other Member States to adopt them . #% Egypt is a friend . #% This measure is yet further proof of the EU 's commitment to greening up its act . #% Thirdly , what are the technical options and conditions ? #% I would remind colleagues that this was already delayed to get the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection when we had really hoped to vote on it in July . #% Together , the ACP countries and the EU form a substantial block . #% They want to be governed by their own people in their own parliament -- and they will be during the lifetime of this Parliament . #% That problem is that in spite of the terrible burden of disease there , Africa only has 0.6 % of the world 's registered healthcare workers . #% Europe can not only look inward during these meetings , we have to look externally . #% I believe we have found a good compromise in the committee by lowering and changing the categories and by using more or less the categories of resolution ECAC/25 -1 . #% I gather that is not a matter of controversy . #% Looking ahead , it is vital that we have the common agricultural policy reform carried out to programme and not delayed , because this is so vital to enlargement and the sensible payment of reasonable subsidies - I say reasonable and stress that word - to the accession countries . #% There are some questions to be raised in this regard . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Menrad on his splendid report . #% 
We have already dealt with that in relation to the earlier proposals on part-time work and on fixed-term contract working . #% I support the actions proposed to facilitate changes , especially in the area of trafficking and domestic violence . #% We should view the growth of China as an opportunity and not a threat , and we look forward to working closely with China . #% Finally , could I make the observation that far from being the Commission 's work programme for 2001 , we might rename it the work programme of the Commission , Parliament and Council . #% The UK has a low proportion of electricity from renewable sources , I believe amongst the lowest . #% We still see the evils of warlordism , ethnic division and a flourishing drug trade . #% However , there are some controversial elements in the report , essentially because of the Commission timetable in issuing its report . #% It is common ground that this sector - ICT - is one of the most dynamic growth industries in the world . #% I am still in Flanders , the third generation of my humble family , fighting here for Britain 's interests . #% He was proving to be an extremely good interlocutor between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets . #% Within the EU , there are a variety of types of provision for early years and in my report , we have said that we want to respect and maintain that . #% All of us in public life must be consistent in the application of principle . #% We have encouraged colleagues from other parties and groups to follow our lead in rejecting this particular suggestion while supporting the report overall . #% I would like to look beyond Copenhagen to see what is going to happen in the next stage . #% The Prime Minister will recognise this failing . #% Mr President , I always seem to follow Mr Cunha in these debates . #% Another area of concern is the temporary-to-permanent contract fee . #% That is not a reference to you President-in-Office ! #% I am sure that is something that will also change . #% I would like to make the point that we need that in the European Union , too , where certain recent ministerial statements , in my view , have not helped that . #% It deals with the internal procedures in the European Parliament . #% Our action , as she was good enough to acknowledge , owes nothing to prejudice . #% Like the Commissioner I think surveillance of these diseases is fundamentally important and that is why I am concerned that there should not be a gap . #% Those are the principles this Parliament must uphold . #% If the numbers of complaints are rising owing to an increasing awareness of what is possible and an awareness of Europe , then that is helping to bring our citizens closer to us . #% We all agree that the Common Foreign and Security Policy must be strengthened . #% Surely , Commissioner , now that we are negotiating common agricultural policy reform , there has never been a better time to prove that we can help the industry and not hinder it with unnecessary red tape and unnecessary costs . #% We must remember that no other enlargement has been as well-prepared as this one has , but we must seize this moment in history to make progress . #% If we look at competition policy , too often it is used as an excuse for industry policy . #% The political points I want to make to the Commissioner tonight , and on which I would like his comments , concern the Council more than anything else . #% Mr President , there is no doubt that we need this legislation : we are absolutely drowning in a sea of milk cartons , hair sprays , coke cans , pizza boxes , bottles of wine and shampoo . #% There is no harm in trying it out . #% For example , waste should only be shipped where truly necessary and unfortunately the proposed regulation is not as strong as it should be on this . #% For benefits which at best are vague and speculative . #% I would not be surprised if they were , because they , too , may wish to keep it from their people that their universities are being used in this way . #% British Conservatives strongly opposed infrastructure charging in our country and we oppose it just as vehemently here in Europe . #% Madam President , on the roll-call vote recorded in the Minutes , I complained profusely that my machine was not working until Mr Harrison pointed out that I did not have my card . #% A wheelchair user or a guide-dog user should have free access anywhere within the European Union . #% Clearly , I do not wish to put the Commissioner on the spot this evening but I am sure we would all welcome this opportunity , sad though it is , to review whether or not there is anything more we can do to ensure safer coaches throughout the European Union and learn from this tragedy to ensure that it does not happen again . #% Animals are suffering and therefore Europe is not yet a civilised society in this regard . #% Let us at least ensure that such injustices do not go unnoticed . #% We do not want to do it very often , but we want the right to intervene when necessary . #% There is no reason to believe that implementation enforcement has improved at all since 1993 or 1999 . #% I am voting in favour of this report today . #% We can provide educational opportunities and employment , but the pay gap still remains . #% We need to be fully involved in the presentation of these fishing agreements right from the start . #% We have to acknowledge that the pharmaceutical industry is intimately linked to health issues and to the national social security systems of our Member States . #% Particularly welcome are the efforts to match regulatory capital more closely with risk profile . #% No wonder that the World Bank and IMF have evolved in a way contrary to their founding objectives to reduce poverty . #% But a whole army of self-employed workers are also exposed to asbestos , in particular the electricians , plumbers and carpenters who come across it while doing maintenance work . #% Who did sign off within the Commission the accounts in 2001 ? #% How do we secure the funding ? #% This will require a review and , perhaps , stronger scrutiny of the legacy of the Prodi Commission than the programme has presently enjoyed , certainly with respect to software patenting , but also access to port services . #% One size does not fit all and individual countries know best how to find their markets , manage their economies and trade with the world . #% Does this not give us an opportunity to check and confirm that we are within the employment legislation ? #% The Labour Group has sought at all times to reduce any unnecessary burden on business whilst at the same time to promote the most effective and practicable of solutions that can be realised by legislation . #% Mr President , the fact that the EU observer mission has garnered great international acclaim reflects the fact that Mr Schori has done an excellent job in raising the profile of what we were doing there . #% Most herds in Britain are not closed herds and therefore animals come in from all over the place . #% They know the true value of their resource and with this agreement , so will we . #% As Mr Belder mentioned , there are reports of increased harassment of some Christians especially Montagnards and Hmong Christians since the uprisings in the Central Highlands in 2001 . #% Mr President , it has taken us twenty-five years to come to the point of a common position which represents a real compromise . #% We would also argue that we need to change the priorities of our international financial institutions so that priority may be given to safeguarding the environment and providing health care and education rather than open markets . #% The object of this proposal is to complete the internal market and to protect the health of users and third parties in Europe : those are indeed laudable aims . #% Mr President-in-Office , what you do not do when you are putting a house in order is put up a new annex and then try to make sure you are still expanding . #% While the report says much about the need for protection of privacy and monitoring of the secret services , what should the individual do ? #% We want to ensure that parliamentary priorities will be maintained . #% 
Madam President , can I add my extreme thanks to the rapporteur for a very principled , intelligent report which very much deserves widespread support in the House . #% The only honest answer to that is that these things can not be reconciled , and the problem is that these things have now , as a result of the Annual Growth Survey , become the general rule . #% We will always be ready to be friends with Malaysia to try to achieve these worthy ambitions and aims . #% I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts . #% There is a major pensions crisis , which national governments are simply failing to address . #% A much better way to hold this sort of debate , which is vital , is to inject some life into it and apply the Brussels format we use to question the Commission on occasion . #% There are many other people at risk on the Net today and we have to be mindful of their needs as well . #% Although I understand some of the concerns of the people who wrote this resolution , especially in the run-up to the election in Pakistan , particularly that anyone standing for election should have to have a university degree , I do not agree with them . #% The internal problems facing Macedonia are not limited to military security threats , there are many policing challenges and the cancer of corruption and criminality , often violent criminality , is undermining the state . #% Thank you for that reply , Commissioner . #% I would urge any Member of this institution who generally believes in democracy and accountability to the electorate to vote against this budget and any other documents that purport to legitimise it . #% I would hope that special attention can be played to the social dimension in central and eastern European countries which is of particular importance . #% I would like some kind of estimate from the Commissioner as to how that research is progressing . #% As President of the Globalisation Intergroup in this Parliament , I strongly support the introduction of a Tobin-type tax to both control financial speculation and raise billions of euros to help alleviate deep poverty in the world amongst the billion plus living on less than a euro a day . #% I can only offer the hope that Ms Schröder matures better than I did and I am sure that she will . #% Finally , we also need to do something about the victims of landmines . #% This must be seen to be done in a manner which is transparent not only to Parliament but also to the client group of the agency and the citizenship itself . #% Under this Presidency , the omens have not been good . #% Simplifying and clarifying the legislative framework should also be our holy grail , provided that such pruning exposes even better the underlying principles of strengthening the productive social and environmental framework in which Europe 's businesses can thrive and prosper . #% I would be genuinely interested to hear your views on those points . #% Campaigns without resources to spread ISAF 's presence outside Kabul are wishful and wistful thinking . #% It is clearly of great importance that such committees gain the trust of consumers and are genuinely stakeholder committees . #% This is a big step forward in dealing with them . #% The change would be to remove the name of Mr William Newton Dunn and replace it with Mr Javed Arain , the fourth-ranked Conservative , who is here with us today in the public gallery . #% Now you are going to lead a battle for the future of Europe . #% I very much regret that we are not able to have a Parliamentary resolution on this subject . #% Since Ahmadinejad stole the presidential election last year , we have seen many dissidents and brave young protestors take to the streets . #% I sincerely hope that all MEPs will either vote to remove natural radiation from the text , or vote for the compromise in committee . #% Madam President , as someone who has a parent who was born in India and has many friends from India in the various and diverse communities of faith which make up India 's rich mosaic of cultures , I can assure you that it gives me no pleasure to move this resolution today . #% Clearly , playing in a competition , which at the end of the day brings with it a place in Europe , provides a major economic motivation for clubs . #% Then Mr Blair socialised -- the same Mr Blair who strode into Brussels in July promising root and branch reform , but then pruned it down to the most invisible square root of a branch of any EU Presidency in memory . #% It is a question of turning those two words around . #% Having said that , we can not be criticised for the help we have given the Commission in its staffing needs over the last two years . #% Citizens need to have confidence that those in authority are acting openly for them and in their best interests . #% in writing . - I will be voting in favour of this report and I think it is important that we take the opportunity to look in more detail at the use of coal as part of our energy needs . #% My explanation of vote , if anyone can hear me , is that although we achieved a great deal for industry as a whole , and the rapporteur changed her view during the process of the report going through the European Parliament - in other words , she took hearing protection into account and moved towards weekly measurements , which I welcome - the amendment that we voted through in Parliament on its exemption for entertainment and leisure for five years while the Commission did a report on the special nature of the entertainment and leisure business was lost in conciliation . #% Improved military capabilities within the well-tried structures of NATO , not institutional geometry in Euro headquarters , are what is needed . #% I hope that this register - if it proves to be a success - will develop into a mandatory register of lobbyists . #% It would be a disaster now if continued delays result in Macedonia turning inwards and abandoning its EU and NATO membership ambitions . #% If the DPRK does not agree to reverse its policy and disarm in terms of its nuclear weapons then the whole KEDO contribution by the European Union should be terminated . #% I welcome the call in this resolution for a just , lasting and mutually acceptable political solution in full accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions , and I would once again echo the UN in urging that there must be a referendum of the people in the region . #% Any solution to Taiwan should respect international law and the right of self-determination . #% I want to know whether junior doctors in some countries are some sort of superhuman who can do without adequate rest and who will not harm their own health or that of their patients in the process . #% One of my last jobs in the Home Office in the 1990s was to set up the Criminal Cases Review Commission . #% Mr President , my group welcomes this report . #% This proposal from the Commission , with the sensible amendments from the rapporteur , will take the harmonisation process forward by requiring a common code system for conditions under which any driver is authorised to use a vehicle . #% Colleagues may also like to recall that public opinion in a number of Member States is still resolutely supportive of the death penalty . #% What is currently happening in the aftermath of the Irish vote on the Nice Treaty is unacceptable by any standards of Western democracy . #% We should be talking to the WHO about not just a possible European reserve fund or stock but also a worldwide reserve stock of vaccines and drugs and possibly some kind of solidarity fund . #% We can not go on as a European Union buying our own debt . #% Mr President , I asked to speak in this debate not just because I am a Member from the north-west region of England where the Sellafield plant is situated , not just because there could be 10 000 livelihoods at risk if Sellafield was closed , and not because I have any vested interest in the nuclear industry . #% Pakistan has been at the forefront of this battle , sometimes carrying a very heavy burden on behalf of the international community , a heavy burden sometimes carried on weak shoulders , a burden the people of Pakistan have carried , absorbing so much violence and carnage which would otherwise have made its way into other parts of the world . #% We do not want to take all the doctors and nurses and teachers from developing countries simply because we need them . #% Galileo has all the makings of an Airbus in space and , as Galileo Galilei pointed out , what goes up must come down . #% However , it is shocking that the PPE-DE Group opposes such a move . #% We were merely visiting the United States as a group organised from within our own national groups . #% Mr President , those of us who survived the conciliation procedure for the water framework directive must be delighted that here we have an issue which is entirely clear-cut and easily understandable . #% As other colleagues have said , this is a thoroughly odd proposal . #% Mr President , on 13 September 2005 , the so-called European Court of Justice made a ruling that gave the European Commission the right to impose criminal sanctions on the citizens of Member States . #% I would like to thank her warmly for her earlier contribution on this subject . #% We in the West must curb our profligate use of energy because it is the poor in the south and east and even hard-pressed European farmers who suffer if we do not . #% The UK is right to question the entire EU budget architecture based on a distorted , wasteful common agricultural policy , which harms developing world farmers . #% Human rights do not exist in isolation , neither should they be considered in abstract . #% The less precise , Mr van Hulten , we are in our resolutions , the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like . #% Mutual trust between them and a proper regime of health and safety has to be the outcome of the BSE crisis . #% Because of that , I am wearing three hats at the same time - if that is possible . #% 
Police are dismayed that the chances of a successful prosecution of traffickers are being undermined by a policy of deporting victims as illegal immigrants or making assistance conditional . #% Referring to the Lisbon Treaty as though it were a fact of life merely serves to reinforce this democratic deficit . #% The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission 's accountability to this Parliament . #% I wish to congratulate the President-in-Office on the brevity with which he answers questions . #% That was an important step forward , but we must go that step further and actually meet in public . #% In the Commission 's clarification yesterday , he speaks about ` all past analyses will have to be done again under a new perspective , and the Commission will have to examine each case on a case-by-case basis ' . #% I would also like to urge the Council and Commission not to use this opportunity to further the project of European integration . #% Finally , the Lisbon agenda will only work if we focus on the skills issue . #% If you add to this various national measures such as rolling stock taxes , then you have to question whether certain Member States ever intended to implement these directives in the first place . #% Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of an alliance of opportunists and hypocrites . #% Now I was going to say whether any more needed to be said to prove the huge conflict of interest that there would be if countries effectively rated their own debt . #% Mr President , just over 20 years ago I had the immense privilege of working closely with Altiero Spinelli when he was the general rapporteur on the draft Treaty that we are commemorating today and I was a young , enthusiastic member of Parliament 's secretariat . #% The issue of women reaching high positions and being given equal opportunities to men is just as relevant today as it was in the UK when the first female prime minister was elected . #% This threat can be defeated only by the concerted efforts of our nations and agencies working together in close cooperation . #% We hope that will not be necessary but , nonetheless , we have to take the two-pronged approach of pursuing proper peace-making diplomacy while maintaining the option of force . #% The EU 's extension of its travel ban against the regime , and assets freeze , were agreed in April but suspended until October in the hope of some improvement in the situation . #% I am talking about the fact that the collateral damage from the effects of the reform of the sugar regime has been felt by the 18 protocol countries . #% Mr President , I too have some qualms about the Onesta report , despite having voted for it . #% These fishing agreements should be primarily negotiated by the industry itself . #% Where is the mention of curbing the rise in temperatures by 2015 ? #% Although this is one of the areas contained in the Commission 's plans , it is clearly a priority for this particular field of technology . #% Mr President , we all support recycling although it must be planned sensibly so that it does not cause more environmental damage than it saves . #% Mr President , on behalf of my Group , I would like to underline that we support this resolution very strongly . #% It highlights in a factual and non-alarmist manner the enormous potential of the European biotechnology industry for assisting economic growth , for encouraging job creation and improving the competitiveness of our industries . #% In those circumstances I would invite the presidency to resist the demands of this sectoral council . #% Some weeks ago I revealed to this Parliament Commissioner Barrot 's past and the affair was whitewashed . #% In Ethiopia , Nigeria , Kenya and Uganda , more than 40 % of people in the lowest economic quintile receive their health care from private providers . #% Once again this resorts to a sort of laundry list approach to legislative initiative and we as a group would like to see a much greater display of choice and political orientation as regards what the European Commission proposes to do from one year to the next . #% We are always stopping you . #% There are of course many problems to be dealt with . #% This House should congratulate the actions of the coalition armed forces , in particular of the United States and the United Kingdom , who have been instrumental in bringing about the downfall of that ghastly regime . #% I regret that the summit came to the conclusion that it should set aside the Irish referendum result and proceed with business as usual . #% Advertising on TV for alcohol and tobacco products are a part of this directive 's concerns . #% Rightly , the EU-ASEAN Joint Committee has not met , since to meet would mean allowing Burma full representation . #% I can not summarize that report now because there is not enough time but I wish to make one or two points . #% But Mr Blair had to say there was nothing he could do , because the British do not have a voice -- that is all sorted out by Mandelson over in Brussels , and he speaks for all 25 countries . #% As the Commissioner will be aware , my colleague , Mr Titley , only on Monday raised the issue of the tragic loss of life involved in the coach crash in the French Alps in which three young people from his constituency were killed on a coach hired locally in France , without seatbelts . #% To use his phrase , I do not imagine that the sky is as blue as he says I have painted it . #% I therefore welcome Mrs Barsi-Pataky 's initiative in the Committee on Industry , but I hope you will agree that this is just the beginning . #% Mr President , this is an historic day and an historic debate because , after 17 years of war in Sri Lanka , the European Parliament for the first time is actually debating how to bring peace to this war-torn island . #% I hope that will be taken on board . #% Fourthly , we must have a special aid programme . #% The question today is who will give the Arabs freedom , the stars and stripes or the stars of the European Union ? #% If our objective is to be effective in achieving a Palestinian State as soon as possible , and establishing peace and justice in the region , we should exert all our diplomatic efforts in that direction and not in suspending the chance for dialogue that we have . #% We also have SMEs trading all over the world and they do just fine . #% When one asks the question , ` what should be the strategic priorities for the Union in the external field to 2007 ? ' a deathly silence descends . #% The fact that the Minister said that we should not spend too much time worrying about the legal basis of the data-retention proposal is absolutely symptomatic of the fact that the Council just does not get it ! #% That is all we ask . #% We have to look at employability in relation to work patterns . #% Will the Commissioner also consider looking into EU standards to encompass the recent outbreak of crypto-spirillum bacteria in the UK ? #% I helped them recently to open their new ` dove ' project - an open drop-in counselling centre for women who are victims of domestic violence . #% As emphasized in the 1997 Green Paper on supplementary pensions and the single market , supplementary pension schemes play an important role as a second pillar of social security which complements the protection provided by the statutory schemes . #% The agreement is not binding and , in any case , it does not fall under Regulation 397/87 which applies to international transport outside the EU . #% In my view at the moment it is far too prone to technical logjams stopping political initiatives . #% When my mates looked a bit mazed , I said '' tis obvious really , by making us big happy families in regions , with fifteen times more votes than those Luxembourgers , we will really feel part of the European culture . #% I said during the first reading that the integrity of the Council rested on its ability to deliver the employment chapter . #% As a result , we shall vote for it . #% Therefore , now that Commissioner Barnier is here , it is important for me to refer to some of my concerns about the entry into force of this regulation on 3 December 2001 . #% Would we encourage the EU to attack Iraq as well , or would we try to hold George Bush back ? #% He is right to balance the need to ensure that the European Parliament and other sections are able to function properly against ensuring that budget increases are kept to an absolute minimum . #% I am very hopeful that they will be alongside the original group within the next 12 months . #% That is something that all of the international community knows , as does the new Iraqi Government . #% Looking at this part of the agreement without detailed knowledge of the negotiations that went into it , it must seem like a very strange animal . #% I hope that trend will continue . #% As rapporteur for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , I know we are not going to have this up and running before 2005 at the most optimistic estimate , so it is the gap between now and then that I am concerned about . #% I am not impugning the good faith of the Polish and Romanian governments , but we know that secret intelligence services sometimes have their own agenda . #% 
I would like to congratulate Mr Howitt on his report . #% It is essential that we do not make the same mistakes again . #% Progress on this issue is now urgent . #% I hope , therefore , that whatever we decide - and I do hope that we decide to proceed with this post when we vote on this week - we will return to the matter and at an appropriate moment , perhaps , during discussion of the next Treaty or before then , we will look at ways of endorsing the position of citizens and making sure their relationship with institutions in Europe is a properly balanced one . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , 2010 will be remembered as the year when the deep flaws in the euro project were exposed and the public in Europe woke up to the sheer stupidity of their leaders . #% I think there is a vehicle there that can be used to give consumers the sort of redress that we are looking for , not just in collective claims but also in dealing with cross-border claims themselves much more effectively . #% We would like that oral amendment to be accepted and then added to paragraph 16 , which deals with the Kurdish issue . #% I was actually in Sri Lanka for a delegation visit . #% These people are our eyes and ears in the forest and we need their help to enforce the agreements . #% There can be no reason why Member States , acting in a uniform way , would necessarily be able to tackle this problem more effectively than individual Member States and , above all , there can be no reason for taking such a close interest in ordinary aspects of people ' s working lives . #% Since the 1970s deteriorating trade terms have cost developing countries a great deal . #% It is their only ray of hope . #% Since then it has continued its campaign of violence and murder . #% However , how can this be reconciled with the Commission 's communication on a wider Europe , which seems to controversially promise eventual freedom of movement to people from the Euro-Med partnership countries ? #% Only 10 % of the 61,000 temporary agency workers in my own region say that they are temporary agency workers by choice . #% As a new Member I thought this was possibly normal practice . #% Devoting resources to unfocused training and woolly business advice , as I am afraid happens with some of the structural fund payments , is not the answer in this case . #% When the EASA was originally set up , it was generally agreed that it would deal with safety issues and have no influence on security . #% As regards Amendment Nos 44 and 45 , I would urge Mr Bushill-Matthews , amongst others , to look at Amendment Nos 51 and 52 and to see if he can not at least support them . #% I would invite all colleagues in this House to engage , back home with their own governments , in the debates that are no doubt taking place as we speak on these subjects . #% We , as Europeans , have to maintain our lead and set an example . #% Several Members have made that point again in the course of today 's debate . #% It seems to me to be another example of politicians being out of touch with ordinary people , who are well aware of the enormous support for such a tax . #% The ALDE Group therefore fully supports the proposal and the amendments adopted in committee , particularly Amendment No 4 emphasising the role of regional advisory councils . #% Free and fair referendums must be held in every Member State or you will unleash the very nationalism that the EU was supposed to stop . #% Nobody in Parliament has been allowed to see the reply from the British Government . #% So do not be too surprised if this Parliament backs the rapporteur and tries to push the Council to live up to the fine words they were so ready to utter . #% If it is based on the footprint of the car then we could see small saloons , four-wheel drive vehicles and two-seater sports cars listed together , clearly a nonsense . #% It has even caused the smugglers to change as they have reverted to old-fashioned smuggling rather than Community transit fraud . #% But it must be complemented by flanking measures to boost education and training , to give young people a chance , to ensure that the peripheral regions of the European Union are involved and benefit from this process . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Wuermeling , for having done a fantastic job in turning a disastrous Commission proposal into something that still has some problems but is considerably improved . #% We saw that very recently , articulately presented to us by President Prodi when he said that we now face the best opportunity to unite Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire . #% I hope I will be able to respond to a number of the points he made in his opening remarks . #% We look forward to achieving a good result in the vote tomorrow with the cooperation that we have seen up to now . #% We understand that and we have got to convey that message back to our Member States so that they can exercise their subsidiarity to make sure that what we have been talking about here is actually put into practice . #% Mr President , others have spoken about rich and poor countries , about the prosperity we have in Europe and the quite contrasting conditions in lesser-developed countries . #% It is hardly surprising that the MEP concerned has written to me in the Committee on Petitions to say that the reply from the President of the Commission is preposterous . #% Should we be surprised that they wanted to do that on the grounds that they have only 0.4 % of the share of world trade ? #% Incidentally - and Mrs Grossetête referred to this - there has been recent press speculation about a third possible infection route through grass contaminated by faecal material . #% We were not very happy with the early versions from the rapporteur because we felt the targets were there to almost micro-manage the market in renewable energy sources . #% Doctor Mahathir 's spat with George Soros about the threat to the Malaysian ringgit only serves to emphasize the interdependence of the world 's financial markets , as if Baring Brothers of Singapore had not already thrown up warning signals enough . #% I believe we have reached a good agreement on the text and I am not proposing to support any additional amendments in the vote tomorrow . #% There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider ' s offensive statements , the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies , sometimes on successive days . #% Madam President , may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry . #% A ` transparency register ' will improve ease of access for citizens wishing to find specific information regarding which organisations and individuals have contact with both MEPs and Commission officials . #% We must set realistic marketing and test end dates for each . #% author . - Madam President , I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani for being with us this evening . #% Mr President , it is customary to congratulate and thank the rapporteurs and I will do that as chairman of the committee , and there are three of them - let us not forget that . #% The role is with the parties themselves , assisted by the great republic across the Atlantic . #% Mr President , I am pleased to say that I have attended the UN Commission on two previous occasions , with both Mr van Van Hecke and Mr Wuori , who are taking part in the debate this afternoon . #% They were not working in laboratory conditions . #% However , I believe the final outcome will work and is a practical and correct approach . #% But imagine for a moment the plight of a mother , Dolores Shambley , dealing with the death of her son , Kris Shambley -- barely 20 in 1998 . #% It did not in Yugoslavia or in the USSR and it did not in the United States of America , which , you remember , had one of the bitterest and bloodiest civil wars in the history of mankind . #% Firstly , are not agreements within Article 98 point 2 consistent entirely with the letter and spirit of the ICC Statute ? #% The twoand-a-half pages cover 1994 and 1995 , with the exception of Thessaloniki and Dublin . #% Could say a little more about the specific actions that will be undertaken within this new GSP scheme and the particular margins that might be anticipated on that particular issue ? #% However , all I had done was tell the truth ! #% Nor can we support any moves towards the creation of a ` European coastguard body ' . #% Take one example : national sustainable development strategies have to be prepared in all cases by next June . #% It is vital that we have a workable and effective contingency plan in place . #% Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so . #% We need those clear measures to support children who have been victims - whether through court proceedings , where obviously the key issue is to find the truth but not in a way that leaves children more traumatised than they were at the beginning of the process , or through the collective work on identifying children . #% The three key elements are monitoring and information , transponders on every ship and monitoring by every maritime authority , an essential component of our package of measures - the Erika package . #% In order for this process to work properly , we have to have transparency , clarity , certainty and the clear involvement of postal customers and consumers . #% In practice , however , as 20 % of the vehicle fleets of most manufacturers are not fitted with air conditioning , these manufacturers would have met the first step of the quota system without doing anything . #% 
Romania was the state that acknowledged that there was a problem and set out to do something about it . #% Article 280 enables the Union to intervene to take subsidiary action under the first pillar . #% The terrible risk is that , despite the talk about building Europe , it may in fact be undermined , and while hoping for a stronger Europe , the failure to address its underlying economic problems will in fact just make it weaker . #% The question is : what message was sent out by the football authorities going back a number of months before the Euro 2000 championship ? #% Many of us feel the individual right must be preserved . #% If you boast about 43,000 documents I wonder if you have actually visited the Internet site ? #% You are going at such a furious pace that we can not put our hands up in time in order to vote . #% Mr President , Prime Minister , excellent goals , very good speech , you have my support . #% Parliament is playing its part - a committee hearing in October will seek to evaluate the programme so far and will then play its part in looking forward to a constructive interpretation of what will be the new Article 152 . #% Firstly , the global health fund against AIDS , TB and malaria . #% My colleagues on the Conciliation Committee expressed the long frustrations of this process in that last marathon session . #% I welcome the Commission 's commitment to using only the Geneva Convention exclusion clauses as a basis for rejecting individuals ' claims for asylum , but I urge the exclusion clauses to be used carefully . #% This will then enable plenary to spend more time on more important matters . #% I am pleased that we also included in category one waste from airlines which may have come from countries that do not have the same standards as we do , although I am sure some people would say that some of the airline food would not be considered fit for human consumption anyway . #% I hope you will not find me too partisan if I say that , while Lord Ashdown 's tenure has not been without controversy , he has demonstrated enormous dedication to the cause of Bosnia 's European future , helping it on the road from Dayton to Brussels . #% The last time they saw him alive he was in police custody . #% Some of these bans date back 40 years or so and they do not take account of modern treatments . #% I agree that we must campaign and educate , but that in itself is not enough . #% My simple request to all 25 Commissioners was for them to declare what free holidays they had received since they became Commissioners . #% I am happy with the vast majority of the compromises that Mr Lange has so skilfully negotiated and wish to pay tribute to the work he has done in that respect . #% Like Mr Parish , I have listened to , and paid reasonable attention to , the fears that we have not really made a market or tested out a market in terms of the provision of insurance . #% In these circumstances , it is important that Parliament reiterates its appeal to the Council and to European Union Member States to maintain and increase the pressure on the Iranian regime on human rights issues . #% Then last year it was on how to fund Serbia . #% It is a common sense balance to a difficult issue and I would appeal to the House to support the resolution as put forward by the Legal Affairs Committee . #% There will be no fishermen , there will be no fishing ports and we will be faced with a crisis . #% The decision is even more incomprehensible when we consider that there was no deadline by which the Commision had to reach a conclusion to its consideration of the application , and that the novel foods directive which might have permitted labelling , was due to come into effect shortly afterwards . #% I look forward to your comments about how we fund all this with keen interest , Commissioner . #% They are crucial if food security is to become a reality . #% 85 % of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is . #% Are there not cases where this quite often happens in the European Union ? #% Mr President , I do not want to strain your tolerance further . #% This report is not before time . #% Millions of mobile phones are stolen every year . #% We believe that this resolution broadly supports these aims . #% Mr Giscard d'Estaing himself concedes that the Convention 's formula for the Commission was not the most glorious of our many achievements , and Commissioner Kinnock agrees . #% Resolution 1199 is enough to justify military action . #% We do not care if we do not get it : we will just go back to Article 272 of the Treaty and will still manage the budget without the Council 's say-so . #% Are you aware that the British Minister said this in the House of Commons and do you expect your mandates to change on the basis of this kind of statement ? #% Not content with destroying the North Sea , Africa is now the prize . #% I am sure I speak for all in this Parliament when I say that the European Parliament stands ready to do all it can to support Pakistan in difficult times to allow it to grow and support it as fully functioning and peaceful democracy . #% It is all about empowering the European Union and boosting the role of the European Commission in particular . #% Thirdly , EUR 400 000 in commitments and payments is added to line 15 04 47 : ` European Year for Intercultural Dialogue ' . #% Second , it will provide for a more effective Union -- a Union capable of deciding and acting with 25 Member States . #% It is very important that the same stringent controls are applied not only to our feed in Europe but also to imported feed . #% The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic . #% It certainly exercised health charities and researchers . #% Madam President , I think it is fair that it be put to the vote . #% My main concern now following UN Security Council Resolution 1701 relates to who is finally going to disarm Hizbollah . #% Mostly it is done by national authorities but there is a certain element of coordination between what they do and what we are doing at Commission level . #% However , it is continuing to scrutinise what is happening in Romania . #% An identical amendment has been put forward by Mrs Ferrer and 28 others and that will be voted on . #% Mr President , at our last part-session in Strasbourg , Mr Farage was warned of the legal consequences when he spoke about Mr Barrot . #% My principal concern relates to - and I echo Mrs Doyle 's words - the implementation of the directive . #% However , I want to focus on the additional weaknesses of that compromise from an animal welfare perspective . #% Then we have the extraordinary role that is being played here by the rapporteur for Bulgaria , one Geoffrey Van Orden . #% That is also well and good . #% Hopefully next week 's elections there might start to bring that to an end . #% I would therefore urge that , when Amsterdam is ratified , the Council works more closely with Parliament in the future to develop the CFSP . #% This current proposal seeks to incorporate the requirements of the 1995 Convention on the standards of training of certification and watch-keeping for seafarers . #% The second major horizontal issue is a lack of resources . #% We have here legislation that will make a real impact on the lives of the 12 to 14 million third country nationals living in the European Union and the 4 million black Europeans . #% After paragraph 2 #% It is also - if you are looking at this as part of an overall policy - part of a sustainable return that people will actually go back with what they have earned . #% It is my party 's unambiguous view that Britain would be better off out of the EU , and the first step towards that position would be to deny Mr Blair a mandate to sign the Constitution . #% Does the Commission believe that this strong policy of stopping sales altogether is a Commission policy or not ? #% We need to defer to give Egypt , a friend of the EU , time for reflection . #% 
There are sufficient safeguards in this measure and in EU law . #% Mr Schulz , your outrage was as entertaining as ever , but it is your Government and Mrs Klamt 's which is using that pretext from Berlin . #% There is a growing need for such information as people become more aware of the importance and relevance of the European Union level . #% Nobody should object to rules intended to safeguard health and to ensure that the consumer can make informed decisions . #% Over one year later , they have been unable to return to paid work because they have been waiting for financial grants to rebuild their homes . #% There is a humanitarian catastrophe looming in Somalia and we are still not holding those responsible in the transitional government accountable for their actions . #% Commissioner Schreyer did say that she would be unavailable and that you would be standing in . #% My understanding is that the Commission has received such a representation . #% I look forward to taking that step tomorrow morning and to the Christian Democrats helping us to do so . #% We still need steps to build the internal market of the European Union . #% On that basis , Sarbanes-Oxley , in her opinion , would not apply to Euronext . #% That is essential for our future . #% Free trade creates prosperity and free trade will make a vital contribution to the recovery of the European economies . #% Personally , I wish to see it implemented as soon as possible to eliminate delays , reduce emissions and enhance safety . #% These compromises are not ideal , but they appear to be the best deal currently possible , given the political majorities in the Parliament . #% There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place . #% I am afraid it will get quite a lot worse . #% But we will take this opportunity to sort out the system once and for all . #% In our regulation let us commit ourselves to these objectives . #% It was not carried because it needed a qualified majority . #% The Council often talks a good fight on many issues but sadly , in our experience it is often the Council that finds it the most difficult to take the final decisions . #% The important thing now is to use it . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , we are debating Voluntary Partnership Agreements . #% The World Bank is withdrawing support but it has not yet said so publicly . #% I have clarified , I hope , the follow-up action that is expected of the Commission and removed an unnecessary and potentially harmful qualification in the common position . #% We also contributed the clause which says that the standards for Member States should also apply to the EU institutions . #% There is global competition in this sector . #% Whilst many of the recommendations from the rapporteur are completely acceptable and while the UK may practise the essential elements of the tax regime proposed already , we do not believe it is the role of the EU to set a rate of taxes in Member States . #% I have a particular interest in that as the Parliament 's rapporteur for the internal market strategy : if all goes well my report will be voted on in February and will be presented to you as a basis for action in the Economic Summit . #% He has failed spectacularly . #% All too often politicians - and they sometimes volunteer themselves - have to be intermediaries in explaining to the electorate decisions taken by other people about which they sometimes feel uneasy . #% Mr Juncker is right about one thing : the EU is in profound crisis and for that we can look back in gratitude upon his six months at its helm . #% Now the real process will start with detailed consideration in Parliament 's committees and this is what is paramount . #% On the other hand , the British delegation , which is now 36 members , has retabled the resolution in its original form . #% CCAMLR is an organization with an excellent remit in all sorts of ways , particularly environmentally . #% But now we have a new Berlin Wall , not on the frontiers of nations but within nations . #% Why has it taken so long to get that air quality check ? #% President Niyazov renamed himself . #% Their territories which are part of the European Union though not part of their main land masses are all represented here . #% However , we do have serious misgivings with regard to the involvement of the Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Union on issues which we believe to be the preserve of individual nation states . #% We all hoped that he would have been released by now , as the 14 others kidnapped since 2005 were released , and we are today adding our voices to those calling for the Palestinian Authority to redouble its efforts to secure Alan Johnston 's speedy release . #% Secondly , neither partner may be married or in another non-marital partnership . #% So far as training is concerned , which , as Mr Harbour knows , is fundamental to the kind of changes that we want to achieve , the comprehensive programme of training for all managers in the Commission which should continue over two years commences this month . #% Mrs Berès has already made the point : equivalence with the Economic and Social Committee , equivalence with the press ? #% People like that have a choice , and they will choose not to come here . #% Although the EU must be an impartial and strong supporter of the roadmap for peace under the Quartet , we must not fund a Palestinian Authority led by an unreformed Hamas , an EU-banned terrorist organisation committed to Jihad and a Caliphate under Sharia law . #% This illustrates how great the challenge still is to us if we are to achieve basic human rights for the world 's poor and deprived . #% No other member of that committee indicated such a line . #% If that is the case , and if there is no final agreement on containing biological and toxic weapons , what kind of message will it send out to what President Bush calls the ` rogue ' states of the world ? #% It is even less reassuring to note that during their time as commissioners not once were the EU accounts effectively signed off . #% Similarly , on the principle of non-interference , China has good relations with maverick regimes ranging from Venezuela to Zimbabwe . #% And I am sorry , but after that performance that you gave earlier ... #% Somebody once said to me that if you want to see what someone 's real priorities are , look at the cheque stubs in their chequebook and you will then see what they really believe in . #% What is holding the eurozone together today is less the dream of the founding fathers than simply the nightmare of the alternative : total collapse of the system . #% You supported the idea of shooing in Mr Barroso without there being any sort of proper contest , but it is on the Lisbon Treaty that I was most interested . #% Vaccination is not the only tool in our armoury , but it must be fully and effectively used from the beginning of any outbreak . #% The resolution further calls on them to actively monitor the implementation of the recommendations for consultation of EU external missions and with NGOs in the field , because the evidence we have so far is that neither the Israeli authorities nor Hamas are taking their responsibilities sufficiently seriously . #% I am glad to see that was denied by the government . #% In her report Mrs Ewing highlighted the problems - despite some changes - which small businesses face in that area . #% Could he take the opportunity , in the light of the hysteria in some areas of the British press about what will happen in terms of migration when enlargement takes place , to outline some of the initiatives I know he has put in place that will ensure that migration from the new Eastern European members of the European Union will be sensible , and controlled in such a way that it will be mutually beneficial to the citizens of those countries and to the existing Member States of the European Union ? #% I know that the Consumer in Europe Group is disappointed that one amendment was not re-tabled . #% Certainly the feedback I get in the UK tells me that the perception is that far too much money is already being spent on political projects , both at home and most certainly -- of all places -- here in Strasbourg . #% Around 17 % of all women in the EU are living below the poverty line , and it is essential that social and labour market policies are adapted to guarantee a minimum income and social justice for women . #% While our own Food Standards Agency argued this case in Britain , it found itself confounded by the negativity of too many producers and too many retailers . #% We also sought to extend the scope of the original proposal , for example to include researchers , as had been requested by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% The importance of bushmeat in the livelihoods of poor people has never been assessed . #% 
I am in favour of a minimum wage , but only as set by each country for itself . #% As I understand it , what is being done at Temelín has already been done in Finland and there is similar upgrading work in hand at Kozloduy in Bulgaria with the support of a Euratom loan . #% It will be desirable to establish databases to facilitate the exchange of information and to create a warning system to enable Member States to take concerted action for all consumers where the need arises . #% Whatever anyone thinks of subsidiarity , for something as important as this we have to make sure we have common rules , particularly because of the Internet and the free movement of people across the EU countries . #% I assure the House that the intention behind the reform generally , and specifically the intention behind the proposals we have made in relation to career structure , is not to try to emulate some form of private sector multinational . #% They still have to wear the burkha , which is medieval . #% In some instances the Commission is still very much in the dark about whether Member States are really complying with legislation because the Member States are very slow in telling the Commission about the state of implementation in the reports that they are obliged to send to Brussels . #% We are concerned about the impact that CETA will have on procurement . #% The rapporteur 's amendments would lead to lower earnings for professional drivers , increase road congestion and pollution and raise transport costs . #% Of course , there are costs ; there are costs to businesses , there are costs to each and every one of us , but the cost if we do nothing is cataclysmic . #% He talks about improving the business environment , investing in the future , putting people at the centre and meeting the global challenge . #% Conservatives believe that this sets a dangerous precedent . #% Last week I had the opportunity to speak at a meeting hosted by the Commission of consumer representatives from consumer bureaux across the European Union . #% Increasing numbers of people across the EU recognise that such a pre-emptive attack would be both illegal and immoral . #% The sign that is being given is that the Commission is turning a blind eye , that it is not really worried . #% Mr President , this is an area in which we have had considerable experience over the years , especially in respect of organophosphate pesticides , which are used as sheep dips and for a variety of other purposes . #% All political institutions must rise to this challenge and so must the Commission . #% We condemn all the violence and political assassinations . #% - The complexity of the IGC process inevitably requires a complex response from the European Parliament . #% We all welcome the setting-up of the project group , which augurs well for good future cooperation with the Commission . #% I welcome the President-in-Office . #% If we , as the EU , do not take ourselves and our agreements seriously , then we can not be surprised if others do not either . #% It will mean that for once the funding will get down to the farmer and he will receive it . #% Those funds would have been better directed to assisting in the disaster relief . #% The fact that we can not build bridges between systems means that some people will still feel that free movement is not sufficiently supported and that will mean at least more work for the Committee on Petitions . #% A member of the House of Lords , Lord Simon , could see at first hand how hard and diligently we work in the European Parliament . #% . Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Frattini for their very helpful statements . #% We tabled the compromise amendments in order to bring forward the major priorities that this Parliament has always emphasised : firstly , a parliamentary hearing for the proposed executive director of the new authority and a three-month period for Parliament to express its opinion on the candidates for a small and tightly-focused management board . #% I advise him to look up the number of animals for which compensation was claimed before he uses his total figures for mass slaughter - as hideous as that undoubtedly was . #% The argument in principle is settled and there should now be no unnecessary delay over the details . #% I appreciate that that is a break in tradition from the nature of a governmental conference as we understood it in the past . #% I agree over the need to move to a risk-sensitive framework which rewards prudent lending and penalises imprudent lending . #% We established our voting lists in favour of this amendment on the basis of the French version . #% We know that this is a political project . #% There are other thanks which need to be given because of the nature of this budget . #% From the perspective of the UK Independence Party , it is not possible for me to entertain any formalisation of the division of competences between the European Union and Member States . #% I therefore welcome this agreement with Chile and congratulate the rapporteur . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I should like to thank and congratulate Mr Macartney on his very useful report on the fishing agreement with Comoros . #% We have got that balance right . #% Mr President , I too am sorry that the vote will not now be taking place . #% As an aside , if we are dealing with completing the internal market , I wonder what we can do about opening the market here to do something about the appallingly bad Air France service to Strasbourg . #% I wonder whether it could expand slightly more ? #% Mr President , it is said that the EU project has no greater ambition than to see the destruction of nation states and to have unwanted and unrealistic federal fantasies imposed upon them . #% It seems to be common practice that codecision legislative proposals are discussed when the fewest MEPs and members of the public are present , and that is wrong . #% It is a pity that her more progressive ideas narrowly missed endorsement in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs and we now have before us a more begrudging approach to long-term residents from third countries , with an overemphasis on terrorism , language acquisition and sufficient resources , especially in the area of pensions . #% It is really two reports in one . #% I am sure we will go up the league tables in the next few years . #% One issue Europe must deal with urgently is the US request to establish Theatre Missile Defence facilities on our eastern border . #% Mr President , following that completely incomprehensible diatribe from our colleague over there , I want to make a serious contribution , although the situation with the recommendation being rejected is somewhat different . #% However , in Annex 1 it states very clearly that ` the European Union will maintain its aid efforts at at least the same level as that of the ninth EDF ' . #% That is simply because the country-of-origin principle ensures the maximum amount of extra competition and extra competition is ultimately the consumer 's best friend . #% That must never be allowed to become a fait accompli hence the amendment to this resolution to put pressure on China , which I warmly support . #% We recognise the important role they played in many , many areas and that they have also been victims of terrorism . #% In my five minutes I can not really say a lot but I know there were four points that Mr Tomlinson wanted to be highlighted and these are as follows . #% Mr Rocard and some others have criticised EPLA , since it would allow EPO Board of Appeal members to become technical judges . #% However , that is no way near enough . #% Oh , so you respect this vote , do you ? #% May I also thank the Secretariat for scheduling this debate , yet again , at such a late hour , even though it means that some of us who started in this House at breakfast time have already been here for over 13 hours . #% Mr President , may I also welcome the Presidency-in-Office . #% This Parliament must learn to fill some of the strategic space that the reforms begin to open up for us . #% Will it be budgetised within the EU 's normal financial procedures ? #% The economic cycle calls for more than an annual disapproval . #% Sir Leon mentioned the need for closer cooperation between regulatory authorities but I would respectfully suggest that competition is a rather different matter . #% I am glad he has not repeated that tonight . #% We have not really had enough debate in this Chamber about the whole issue of our role in better lawmaking or improving and simplifying the regulatory climate , as the Commission reminded us . #% How anyone can endorse or allow fraud is beyond me . #% 
The above comments from constituents have two things in common : their anger that Socialist MEPs should be proposing such amendments in the first place , and their sheer disbelief that such MEPs could be so out of touch with reality . #% As the presidents of the SAP countries said at their summit on Monday , the process of integration could be assisted greatly by offering a genuine hope to their citizens that soon they will be able to travel freely in the whole of Europe . #% Although the report is a step in the right direction , there is still more that needs to be done . #% Mr President , in supporting the political dialogue with the Andean Community , let us recall that only a month ago Colombian President Uribe was in this Chamber championing his so-called democratic security policy . #% We have before us a report which had 106 amendments in committee - a record for the discharge . #% This proposal is the wrong proposal . #% More and more , European legislative proposals that we consider in this Parliament are about amending or updating existing European legislation rather than bringing forth new legislation on new subjects . #% These were : #% As the House is committed to transparency and financial probity , I am sure it will join with me in regretting the action of the Standards Committee . #% The Roma need understanding and massive resources deployed in order to provide them with the essentials of life , education and job opportunities , but equally they have to change their lifestyle . #% I would draw Members ' attention in that respect to Amendments Nos 134 and 140 . #% The tourism industry has benefited from the single currency and its continued growth is directly linked to the fact that EU citizens now possess more disposable income . #% I would like to concentrate on one or two specific political issues . #% The Parliament decided to ignore the letter of the British Prime Minister , ( ... ) and the Heads of Government of France , Germany , the Netherlands and Finland , that there must be no increase in the EU Budget ( ... ) . #% I am therefore encouraged by the above paragraphs , as we are taking a stand on the issue of the unnecessary and disproportionate erosion of civil liberties undertaken by governments against their own citizens under the guise of the prevention of terrorism . #% I welcome the proverbial Polish plumber and recognise that the new countries are driving the economic reformist agenda . #% Again , on behalf of the Socialists , I want to say that we will be voting for this report tomorrow and looking for European Union action on chemicals which mimic hormones and which have been shown to cause all sorts of strange health and reproductive difficulties in fish , birds and other wildlife . #% It is also restricted by its own terms , and many organisations that need help at a European level and have been turning to Parliament will now be able to use this new legal base . #% This is a further element in what is a most crucial package of legislation that is now being considered by Parliament to create a single regulatory framework for electronic communications . #% Similarly , as Mrs Doyle mentioned , figures published by IATA show that over the last 40 years , through technological development , aircraft are 70 % more fuel efficient . #% The result is devastating . #% Nothing could further emphasise the European Union 's determination to commit itself to being fully secular in nature than the accession of Turkey , a large country with a large number of Muslim people . #% The Commission opposes this reform on the grounds that it implies political interference , but we believe that the Ombudsman is perfectly capable of distinguishing between maladministration and defective politics . #% The inability of the Russian authorities to deal with the Beslan situation reveals many worrying and enduring problems that seem to be deeply embedded in the Russian state . #% Those aspects seeking to block the creation of false independent status , dealing with record-keeping , and placing a focus on the duties of consigners and others responsible for determining routes and timetables , are particularly relevant . #% However , a great deal needs to be done . #% But in essence what we have tried to do is to rectify that inequity . #% Do not they deserve to be a special case too ? #% The culture minister , Akhmed Zakayev , resides in my city , London , also as a refugee , and in the past has denied any links with Mr Basayev . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the two rapporteurs , Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Costa Neves , for the remarkable job they have done in getting these guidelines together in such a short space of time . #% But the reason why I wanted to be shadow rapporteur on this report , and to support Mr Belder , was that , for disabled people , access to work depends more and more on access to the web . #% However , we have abstained on this report today as we do not support the proliferation of new EU agencies and institutes ( as outlined in paragraph 1 ) that will add to the burden of the taxpayer and increase bureaucracy without any proven benefit to the people they are supposed to serve . #% On the second question raised by Mr Collins , the Commission will make significant savings because the purchase of the Berlaymont building at a comparatively competitive cost puts the institution in a better negotiating position in a property market where the major participants are well aware that the Commission will vacate a number of substitute buildings when it returns to the Berlaymont in the early part of 2004 . #% I must mention the Kozlodvy nuclear power plant and in particular the closure dates for units 3 and 4 . #% That is the right approach : we need that stability in the guideline structure . #% Now some Members will say Appendix II is enough , but there is no evidence of that . #% On Libya , I strongly support the no-fly zone and the pressing need for regime change . #% It is now five years since the Commission established a small , informal working party under the then Director-General of DG Development to recommend a new relationship with non-governmental organisations . #% Those three factors , incidentally , are also present within the European Union . #% Madam President , since you have announced that the votes will start at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday , could you tell me what will happen to my report on the European Year of People with Disabilities ? #% Turning to the definition of child pornography in the Karamanou report , my group has problems with the definition which includes creating the impression that the person depicted is a child . #% That is a disappointment for this House . #% The opportunities for business to innovate and meet the demands of the higher standards that we expect in our environment will stand them in good stead vis-à-vis the rest of the world . #% I do not want to go over old ground . #% He seized the opportunity while with the business community in Mumbai recently to set out his views on globalisation . #% Mr President , the present national variation that Mr Clarke says gives an open goal to criminals will persist and even grow under the Council Conservative-Socialist deal . #% Hearsay and hindsight have been the chief witnesses . #% What we must respect absolutely is Lithuania 's sovereignty in this matter . #% Our position as Members of the European Parliament is safeguarded in this respect , and Members who had genuine fears that this would be some sort of snoopers ' charter or some sort of a new right given to officials to report confidentially on MEPs with wild allegations can rest assured that this is not the case . #% That is why my report calls on the Commission to rethink its strategy , to wake up to the fact that old fashioned concepts of national comparative advantage simply no longer apply in a world where brain power can zip round the globe at the flick of a computer key . #% It should mean ripping rules out by the hundred . #% Parliament 's Rules of Procedure however state that Members must declare their direct financial interests if they are going to speak in the debate . #% We really do not have much joined-up thinking on that subject . #% Therefore , any attempts to improve standards in our schools must be welcomed with open arms . #% Both independent evaluations as well as the Commission emphasize the need to enhance the Foundation 's role in providing expert vocational training assistance to partner countries . #% I can think of no better hands to put it in than Commissioner Flynn 's , but I would like answers to these questions . #% I do not think that is possible but if we could get an agreement as to what we want to do throughout the year , then we can come to some conclusions . #% This will not only transform the lives of many people with disabilities who will now be encouraged to play as full a role in society as everyone else , but it will also transform the economy of the European Union and make it truly the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world based on greater social cohesion . #% One final point - we went to a lot of trouble to get this report put together and there was consensus on its content . #% The Council has widened access to some of its internal documents , but maintains confidentiality on Member State demands on national delegations and national positions . #% Our efforts should moreover not be at the expense of the eight million people who die every year from preventable diseases such as malaria . #% I close by expressing the hope that the Council in particular will be able to give us sufficient comfort this evening so that we can proceed to a favourable vote tomorrow . #% I would point out to the other side of the House that you can not be selective in the application of principle . #% Nor can I support any reference to tripartite contracts : by allowing the Commission to institute such actions directly with regions , we would be allowing our nation states to be bypassed . #% . We in UKIP strongly support the brave stand taken by the McCartney family to gain justice after the murder of their brother , Robert . #% This is essentially blackmail and a manipulation of the World Trade Organisation disputes procedure . #% 
I support recognition of the Transitional National Council and the unfreezing of EU-frozen Gaddafi assets and releasing the money to the Benghazi pro-democracy forces to buy supplies and , yes , even to buy arms . #% In 2003 the Court of Auditors looked at the LIFE scheme and found that financial beneficiaries failed to keep sufficiently transparent and detailed accounts . #% My pig farmers do not want charity but they do want a chance . #% I admire Mrs Trautmann for the robust way in which she stood up to the interventions at our meeting . #% Other countries each have their own circumstances that need to be addressed : Greece , for example , has some 400 islands , and Luxembourg is land-locked . #% I believe we are doing so and I heartily endorse the work that all our colleagues put into this . #% We have made progress , but in which direction ? #% Mr President , I also congratulate the Commission and the Council on the quality of their joint report , and especially the rapporteur on his own powerful report on this key issue . #% The best maxim is ` practice what you preach ' . #% Turkey 's membership of NATO presents many of our Member States with a special responsibility in this respect . #% What is being proposed here - and , of course , it is because the European Union is so desperate for money and is in so much trouble that it needs its own resources - is to use an opportunity to bash the financial sector because they are very unpopular at the moment and to introduce a financial transaction tax just in the European Union , as if somehow that will gain us great revenue . #% The new countries must be pressured by this presidency to continue the reforms necessary for their successful integration into the Union . #% We in this Parliament called for the speedy completion of the internal market and particularly recalled that an effective internal market is a major weapon in the European Union 's competitiveness . #% Yet the Commission 's communication and this Parliament 's conviction is based on the principle that we can do better . #% I would also like to change past practice by congratulating Mr Bushill-Matthews . #% Then of course it is up to us . #% As far as I can see the pressure is coming from ordinary people who are very worried by this proposal . #% We are in favour of including the other five greenhouse gases , although measurement is an important question . #% The British Post Office is now 371 years old , and it was the British in 1840 who brought out the first postage stamp , bearing the head of Queen Victoria . #% A single enforcer for financial services in the EU would have an impossible job , given the divergence of rules and legal systems across the EU . #% in writing . - Whilst we agree with those parts of the proposal that provide for the equal treatment of Parliament with the Council with regard to access to meetings and to information ; for regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of the Parliament ; cooperation on citizens ' initiatives ; impact assessments on legislation ; and the use of ` soft law ' ( rather than punitive law ? ) ; we disagree with : a reaffirmation and strengthening of compulsory time limits for the implementation of directives ; and the use of congratulatory language about the European Union and its officers . #% Budgetary transparency is clearly necessary , as Parliament proposes to draw a clear distinction between the contribution from the Community budget and contributions from other sources and to distinguish between expenditure on physical reconstruction and on institution-building . #% I ask the President of Parliament to consider this very urgently . #% Otherwise there is no point in having this principle of mutual recognition of national decisions within the European Union . #% Together with Romano Prodi , I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses . #% I contest the point made about the views expressed during that visit as being particularly extreme . #% Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority . #% As you suggested , Commissioner , preferences for countries such the Windward Islands harm no one and are not aimed at damaging the trade of Latin American exporters or of any other exporters . #% That must be our priority . #% A little more fiddling around with Article 136 is not an answer . #% Montesquieu has been quoted . #% It is a completely illogical position to say that antique instruments will be exempted but new instruments will be banned . #% The challenge for the new government is to maintain its coherence and to translate its aspirations , its ambitious programme , into concrete reality . #% However , when released , such meats should be exported or used as emergency supplies outside the EU - possibly to Russia , as has been said - to avoid recreating the problem of over-supply . #% Was this in order to engineer a bloody showdown ? #% It is extraordinary that the USA 's bilateral embassy to Belgium is still double the size of its mission to the European Union . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , as rapporteur for the eastern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy , I welcome the Commission 's commitment to deepening relations with six countries to the east in the new Eastern Partnership . #% We should be able to do more and I hope we will be able to do so . #% If we do not vote in accordance with the block compromise we would be unpicking everything that had been agreed , or the basis of the agreement , in the compromise . #% I agree with what Mrs Hieronymi said . #% How does the presidency intend to bring these countries on board ? #% Should the state not , in these circumstances , support their effort ? #% However , it can also apply where there are genuine vacancies , which can not be filled from the national labour pool , and where Member States are not issuing sufficient work permits , or where there is a creaking bureaucracy that can not respond quickly enough to applications with a labour-market purpose . #% I do not recommend fighting fire with fire in this circumstance . #% That will lead to not only more deaths on the road , but to health problems for the hauliers themselves . #% We accepted paragraph 11 ( b ) as meaning an alignment of national definitions of serious offences so that criminals can not escape justice by exploiting loopholes , but we are clear this does not mean the harmonisation of all national justice systems . #% That needs very serious consideration in future . #% The presidency must be unequivocal in its support for economic reform , for greater labour market flexibility , for more competitive taxation policies , and for reducing barriers to employment growth , particularly the excessive regulation that pervades all our economies . #% Therefore I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she regards such overblown bureaucracy as a hindrance to the free movement of people in the European Union . #% I would like to say that I deplore the sluggish progress on this question in the Council . #% Mr President , between 25 September and 19 October 1915 , 61 000 British troops were killed , captured or wounded at the Battle of Loos . #% Well , you might argue that there is not much democracy left in the European Union now , but there should at least be some degree of accountability , and I would argue that , on the eve of what may well be a fourth rejection of this Treaty , the one that kills it off for good , this Parliament should not install you as Commission President for the next five years until we have that result . #% Article 202 , in other words , is much more flexible than the Commission 's legal service seems to believe . #% In this perspective I want to look at the balance between economic , environmental and social issues . #% However , we have voted against this report today as we do not support the proliferation of new EU agencies and institutes that will add to the burden of the taxpayer and increase bureaucracy without any proven benefit to the people they are supposed to serve . #% We are glad to see you here , your usual active self . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Wallis , for an excellent interim report , as also the Chairman , Mrs McGuinness , who will , I am sure , be a thorn in the side of the regulators and ensure that we can get to the bottom of what actually happened with Equitable Life . #% Third , there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment . #% All of this smacks to me of cultural apartheid . #% Can I protest to you on behalf of all my colleagues working on this dossier about the quite unacceptable way in which this debate has been scheduled ? #% Here there is the call for the creation of a free-trade area with the US by 2015 . #% It was long clear to the Liberal Group that the only interim solution would be to put a time limit on the delegated powers . #% Yes , we must all remain vigilant , but we must also all work together positively to make sure TENs meet our objective of ensuring we have environmentally sustainable transport policies to pass on to future generations . #% These will be generated by high levels of research and development spending close to the market . #% Thus I view this report with some degree of dismay and trepidation . #% The European Union 's common foreign and security policy has no legitimacy . #% 
Amendment No 71 represents a plea for help for plastic recyclers . #% The armed actors in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) have perpetrated gender-based violence through various forms , including sexual slavery , kidnapping , forced recruitment , forced prostitution and rape . #% But under the new law , farmers are given the power to keep vaccinating for their own peace of mind , whilst profiting from easier exports . #% Mr President , Belarus is in focus now , not only for sharing over one thousand kilometres of border with the EU , but also as the last surviving major European bastion of neo-soviet ideology . #% We must also urgently speak out on the issue of crops engineered using terminator technologies . #% I know that the President of the Commission is personally committed -- as I am -- to economic reform and liberalisation as the only way of ensuring growth and greater prosperity . #% It is not clear whether they were lying or whether they were confused . #% Mr President , I am pleased that EU leaders will finally address the case for legal migration , although we have to be clear that numbers or quotas must be set at national level and not by Brussels . #% I believe that the three amendments the Commission has accepted are the right ones . #% We now have a much more positive view on reception conditions , in particular , issues such as more rapid and widespread access to education and vocational training , not just education for children . #% One thing Parliament has always stressed from the very inception of Europol is that any international police organisation - perhaps in the course of time with operational powers , however limited they may be - can only be allowed to exist if there is a proper system of democratic control and accountability - just as we would expect proper democratic accountability by our own national police forces . #% It says that such controls should not be racially discriminatory and should avoid fuelling xenophobic attitudes or hostility to ethnic minorities . #% This will ensure that there is no hiding place for substandard ships , that all ships will be watched and monitored and that they will not escape compliance with their international obligations . #% Policies adopted by socialist governments have stunted the growth of economies and drowned us and our vital businesses in costly regulatory frameworks . #% Commissioner Nielson was not here when I made my opening remarks but one of them concerned the Global Health Fund . #% The first is the health of the people of Europe , because I believe that is a prerequisite of Lisbon . #% This proposal has little to do with road safety , and more to do with an ingrained anti-road agenda from the European Commission . #% To this effect , the Commission could draw up a non-exhaustive black list of types of behaviour considered to be unfair . #% I say that to be complimentary , not to be insulting . #% It is vitally important that these funds are properly and efficiently spent and accounted for . #% For those who now set high standards , as I believe my own country does , it would be a reassurance that we are all toiling in the same vineyard and on the same level cornfield . #% That in itself speaks volumes about the Labour Party 's attitude toward the European Parliament . #% For example the completion of Unit 2 at Cernovoda is fully justified by the Phare study of August 2001 . #% The light went on . #% As already indicated in operative provision 11 , this should not stop at Europe . #% It has been a long time in the making - six years from the first meetings we had , as she has mentioned . #% Thirdly , as the House is aware , the European Union has a special responsibility for reconstruction within the United Nations Civil Administration , UNMIK . #% Sea angling needs encouragement . #% It is not just a question of delivering enlargement , but also of making it work . #% There are one or two that went through that I have some doubts about , particularly Amendment No 7 , which I can not see as being environmental at all , or as contributing to the overall attempt to reduce the amount of ozone-depleting substances at ground level anywhere in the Union . #% The Committee on Petitions would very keenly wish to respect and observe the Rules of the House and that is why our Chairman , Mr Gemelli , took careful legal advice . #% We also welcome and would like to encourage and deepen the widening of the ASEM process and its parallel parliamentary dialogue through ASEP . #% Personally , I strongly support the Commission 's proposals to include third-country nationals in the regulation and to do so on the legal base it has proposed . #% I also urge the Spanish Presidency to reach agreement in the Council as a demonstration of the seriousness of its commitment to social integration , and also to labour mobility , as will be called for again in the Barcelona Summit . #% If we are serious about nuclear non-proliferation , the Iranian Government must understand that , whilst Iran has the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , it will not be allowed to deceive the world in pursuing its ambition of having nuclear weapons . #% At the end of the day , we must get beef consumption up , we must convince the consumer that it is safe and let them eat European beef . #% Madam President , following your statement yesterday regarding the state of the air conditioning in the building , I have a slight problem in my position as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Canada . #% We hope that the Commission will look at their situation and at the situation of those others considered particularly vulnerable at this point . #% I am only here to represent the Committee on Agriculture on the veterinary medicines side . #% Even though she is not listening to me -- I think she is working on her voting list -- I want to pay tribute to her and the very courteous and painstaking way in which she has led our work on a very complicated and difficult proposal . #% Indeed , in some Member States , such as my own , which have tended to follow the American model , the gap between rich and poor has been widening . #% We also recognise in Parliament that we have not achieved the full flexibility we had hoped for with regard to access to benefits in kind for frontier workers and their families . #% The Murphy report is splendid and prepares the way for better and safer public transport in the future . #% The second important point to highlight is that the answer is not protectionism , either by countries trying to put up barriers or within companies trying to protect old jobs when the market has moved on . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , I welcome the opportunity to have this discussion tonight on Galileo , but it gives me a very strange sensation of being in a time warp . #% The issue is not only what happens within the Member State - as the Commissioner knows , there have been a whole series of rapid alerts during 2002 . #% Thirty-nine per cent of the electorate could not be bothered to vote . #% Mr President , you are going to have a number of these incidents over the next months . #% The Commission is very conscious of the need to increase the proportion of women in A1 and A2 grades . #% This outbreak will continue for some time and must , as the Commissioner said , be followed by a full inquiry . #% Nevertheless , we all condemn the inappropriate and excessive use of the death penalty in countries such as China and Iran . #% They have committed no crime apart from trying to help Afghanistan and the Afghan people . #% It certainly has . #% Your new annual growth survey promises more of the same . #% This is why we must consider all options , including military ones , to prevent it . #% It is bizarre in a way , because the Commission seems to be conducting prosecutions in the media , rather than in hearings or in courts . #% Madam President , I found the last contribution rather surprising because anyone who has observed the process of economic and monetary union over the last 7 1/2 years knows that this House has followed the whole process very closely . #% Yet they are saying to me that the EU is lagging significantly behind the US and the UK and national authorities . #% I believe that the positive list , as it stands , is far too limited . #% Then last week in Ripon in Yorkshire , I was asked to share a platform with a Member of the Zimbabwean Parliament , a shadow minister . #% Also , when we make quota cuts , it is B quota that should be targeted first , because it is this quota that is being exported onto the world markets , thereby distorting trade . #% I want to highlight two aspects of the Agenda highlighted in this resolution . #% Secondly , labelling will identify the country or countries of origin of beef . #% Mr President , this has been a complicated matter and a very sensitive one as well . #% I was told that , even if it were possible , it would take several months to find this information . #% Perhaps if you returned to this matter when these matters referred to by Commissioner Liikanen had been finally agreed , we might be in a better position to give you a more positive response . #% 
There is also a gap that we have yet to fill for people for whom no return to their country of origin is possible - for example , to Zimbabwe - and who are often left legally destitute , as it were , and , therefore , need to find a way to keep themselves alive . #% If we are serious about tackling man-made climate change then we must be serious about reducing global aviation emissions , which are expected to double by 2020 . #% It really is time that the Conference of Presidents had a look at the way we time our voting to ensure that we can do these things sensibly . #% The fact that we have had to wait two years for this proposal to become a practical reality is a poor comment on the urgency with which they regard it , although the situation was plainly critical from the time of the outbreak of the BSE crisis onwards . #% Carry on trying to divide us , because what you will do is inflame the English and English nationalism and we will assert ourselves and we will insist on governing ourselves again . #% Many of my constituents working in this industry have been made redundant time after time and they see manufacturing moving to the low-wage economies of developing countries . #% The other main group opposing a full inclusive definition of human rights is the Christian Democrats . #% Projects have been started which depended on the Constitution for their legitimacy . #% Could I also say on the broader topic of completing the internal market that , during the Finnish Presidency , we have had some very important strategy papers and they actually require a much higher priority than they are receiving in the Community at the moment . #% The number of subjects it covers will continue to grow and we will probably see a consolidation of ideas on the monetary dialogue and other aspects . #% Will you please keep up all possible pressure , perhaps in conjunction with Commissioner de Palacio , to ensure a decent air service as long as we have to remain in Strasbourg once a month , which I hope will not be for very much longer . #% Investment must focus on rural areas , providing better water supplies and sanitation , improving transport links and the quality of grid power output . #% And now we have a joint declaration in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement , setting up for the first time a way in which Parliament will be fully involved in consultation and information , including in political dialogue on the CFSP . #% Will the Commission publish evaluation reports on both of these issues so that we in this House can put some political pressure on Member States to get on with it ? #% We see the need for reform , and the need for reform for our farmers . #% When it was built we vowed that no minority would ever be scapegoated again . #% We have lots of discussions coming up on communications policy . #% There are a number of reasons why Labour Members of this House are unable to support the report as it stands before us today . #% May these soon ease as confidence builds up . #% As regards ` sinks ' I feel we have the best possible deal : a prohibition on companies using credits from land-use projects and carbon forest sinks until at least 2008 . #% On that day she will have spent 9 years 238 days in detention . #% Madam President , I thank the rapporteur for an excellent report and for continuing to show her interest in and commitment to these issues . #% Also , as more migrants come to Europe , diseases such as the three above will become more common . #% I can only pick out a few points , but firstly : refugees . #% ` My clear stand is that the European Union should only step in with legislation where there is an obvious need for such regulation and , in such cases , only to the necessary extent . #% We are actually talking about what are minor issues in the global picture of things . #% The challenge to them is to name a country with a weak economy that has opened up and succeeded in developing its economy . #% We are talking about one issue which is how to fund Kosovo but there is a lot in this budget that we should be proud of , as Mr Walter and others have already reminded us . #% Secondly on the extension of the scope of the directive to include recreational waters : Labour MEPs can not support moves to extend the scope of the directive to recreational waters . #% ESPRIT , an important information technology programme designated under Mr Bangemann at the beginning of the Commission as it was in early 1995 , was transferred from originally DG XIII which was under Mrs Cresson to Mr Bangemann . #% There is going to be another report on this - I will not go into details . #% They particularly do not want people to know about and reflect upon the trade which is more concerned with cost-cutting than with the end product in terms of consumer satisfaction . #% We can create new pathways for the integration of those who are homeless and excluded . #% author . - Mr President , it is great news that we have achieved the right number of signatures . #% All this , however , was undermined by the events of last December , when some Members of this House - some Groups indeed - wished to refuse discharge but keep the Commission . #% Our consumers have a right to safe food , and third-country imports must be of the same high standard . #% This is why this report , which is unlocked by the UK Presidency 's initiative as Freddie remarked , aims at stopping the inappropriate behaviour of the use of noxious chemical agents which are some of the worst chemical agents that people can use at work . #% . -- Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Matsakis for all the work he has done on this report . #% The inability to build bridges between national systems is problematic and it leads many people to feel poorly served when gaps appear between the systems . #% While the reality is that not all European governments are left-wing , the Commission is the representative face of those governments in Europe . #% Certainly we must all put job creation at the top of our own agendas . #% The UK can reflect on why so many people wish to come to our country and especially to my city , London . #% The way in which this junta is now cynically trying to hold sham elections such as to ensure the opposition will be muzzled is entirely characteristic of these generals and the way in which they arrogantly disregard the opinions not only of the Burmese people - their own people - but of democratic leaders around the free world . #% The alternative is an inward-looking Russia , developing its own authoritarian style of democracy which has more in common with the Romanovs and Tsarist Russia than a modern constitution . #% We must emphasise the good-news stories of when we help the citizen . #% It was a meeting that reminded me of Margaret Thatcher 's comments at a similar meeting when she complained of being surrounded by people who found every reason for not doing things and not changing things rather than giving her solutions to the problems she had . #% I would agree with virtually everything that has been said this afternoon . #% This institution in particular was built out of the ashes of the Second World War with a commitment that we would never turn our eyes or ourselves away from the appalling violence that man commits upon man . #% Mr President , I welcome what Mr Watson has just said and point out that you can make an early contribution to securing a reform of our procedures by placing my report on the agenda of the March part-session . #% If those are included within Mr Barroso 's idea of consolidation , that is fine . #% I would warn the Commission about the danger of over-regulation in this sector . #% SAFTA will bring manifold expansion in the region . #% In addition , this year we are asking the ECB Governing Council to deal with a specific problem it has faced in a couple of recent interest rate changes . #% If Parliament does not act responsibly , it will not be taken seriously . #% I want to take us back , in line with what Mrs Rühle was saying . #% To London I say : you can not do that ; be realistic ! #% This raises serious doubts about the independence of the new court , especially when we consider that the EPO has no scruples about issuing patents for software and that this proposal commits a single patent court to following the precedents set by previous EPO decisions . #% A nuclear-armed Iran is therefore particularly dangerous to Western security , and that of Israel in particular . #% Private storage aids can relieve an over-supplied market in the short term . #% The Dublin Convention in itself has always been important but it is the flaws in the Dublin Convention and our failure to administer the Dublin Convention properly , which has caused issues to arise which could even threaten the human rights of some of the applicants and individuals concerned . #% Mr President , instead of looking backwards I would like to look forwards . #% Mr President , if EU leaders were actually to deliver the goals set last week of the central role of the UN , an EU capacity in foreign and defence policy and strengthening the transatlantic partnership , most of the public would cheer . #% ( Murmurs ( of dissent ) ) I am going to return to the presidency because that is what I am expected to speak on . #% I was flabbergasted to hear you say , Mr Clarke , that this is not a sterile debate about principles . #% I would like to concentrate on that one question of water . #% Is it fair to give these multinationals still further advantages over our traditional producers ? #% 
Nevertheless , the coordination between Denmark , Sweden and Finland on the Arctic Council has been exemplary and has served as a platform for the EU 's wider interest to be heard in the region . #% Do we have to wait until the end of this debate to give Commissioner Fischler the chance to respond ? #% That is why tonight , regretfully I can not agree with the tactics suggested by Mr Jarzembowski because it is a recipe for going nowhere at all , very quickly . #% No one thinks about the wisdom of pouring the dust through the sieve in the first place and quite simply the way to stop the dust being lost is to stop pouring . #% That of course is why the European Union is so interested in universities and further education . #% We expected -- perhaps wrongly -- that the ruling would be made prior to the vote being taken . #% That is all the more reason why we need to treat this matter with urgency , why we need to resolve it , and why Parliament should continue to play a strong role in the future in the superintendence and monitoring of vital issues relating to the granting refugee status to those who might apply . #% In general point 4 it is stated that : ` the maximum total figure for expenditure ... for 2007-2013 is EUR 862.363 million ' and that ` all figures are expressed using constant 2004 prices ' , but that ` there will be automatic ... adjustments for inflation ' . #% However , there a number of suggestions in this report with which we take issue and which have led to our decision on the final vote . #% I should like to put a question to the President-in-Office that has been already answered in part . #% We need to ensure that we establish rules at European level that encourage the use of computers and do not stifle economic development . #% If Parliament objects to an implementing measure adopted under comitology , then the Commission must either withdraw it , amend it or take account of Parliament 's objection in some other way , or come before the House to make a statement to explain why it is taking any other course of action . #% Since then he has come to Brussels and they have clearly spiked his drinks , because now he is saying : ` If there had been a referendum on the founding of the European Community or the implementation of the euro , do you think these would have existed ? ' #% Mr President , I wish to express my concern about the Environment Committee 's amendment , listed as No 2 , which seeks to remove what seemed to be the rather sensible averaging and banking option . #% Madam President , I should like first to apologise to the Commissioner for having been called out of the Chamber while he was speaking . #% The Commission ' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market . #% We can not , and must not , look the other way , for one day people will look the other way when it happens to us . #% According to the report , each Member State must ensure that more information is disseminated to businesses that want to provide services across borders . #% Mr President , to follow on from that , the figures that we have been given - the Copenhagen figures - are actually lower than the figures provided subsequently . #% Irish voters will have to vote yet again on this treaty because the EU simply does not take no for an answer . #% I believe -- along with Mr Stevenson , and we have tabled an amendment to this effect -- that instead of leaving it at 5 % we need to reduce it to 2 % . #% Colleagues will know that this is a most appalling case . #% While groups of companies would be permitted to bring forward a single registration , separate registrations would still be allowed , making it much more likely that repeat animal tests will take place . #% Member States can not escape their responsibilities by passing on to Europe things they are not sure they want to do at home . #% The retention of the 6 to 12 mile limit will assist in development of conservation measures and do much to protect the coastal fishing on which many of our fragile communities depend . #% I agree with Mr Duff 's proposal that rapporteurs should name the lobbyists that they have had contact with when drafting a law . #% Secondly , my report does not deal with the foreign and security policy architecture - that is left to Mr Tindemans ' report , which we are discussing . #% Further , due to the demographic changes we are experiencing , and with an ageing population , this is a problem that will only increase . #% I have here documentary evidence that the Commission has made proposals to the Council . #% The existence of a High Representative who will be able to deal with the day-to-day issues and the establishment of common strategies will enable us to start to have a more coherent approach . #% Secondly , enhanced inspection for other categories of ships and , thirdly , the guidelines on inspections themselves will become mandatory . #% Mr President , the role of the inspectors appears to be crucial to this debate so perhaps I should spend some time looking at their activities . #% In particular , the report demands strong emission reductions at home , starting with 20 % to 30 % domestic reductions in the EU by 2020 , increasing to between 60 % and 80 % by 2050 . #% In my country the situation is even worse . #% Mr President , this proposal is about money for an instant , non-military response by the Union to crises . #% If these organisations are to survive , let alone flourish , then they not only need our financial and moral support , they need legal certainty . #% It normally meets in my absence but I accept full responsibility for its activities . #% The Lisbon reform process is back on track . #% We now have a package of measures that is going to ensure the health and safety of the European public and the quality and safety of the European meat supply for the foreseeable future . #% It transpires from these documents that , at its inception , there was no legal basis for the CFP . #% We must learn from the mistakes we have made to ensure that we can get effective international cooperation in putting the whole of the region back together again . #% So I went to the ECB and asked for a meeting . #% The very idea is absurd . #% I note the rapporteur graciously referred to the joint amendment we tabled , which was the great highlight in committee - perhaps it could be the highlight of his report . #% We look forward to the continuing cooperation that we have had , both inside and outside this House . #% in writing . - Mr von Wogau has my congratulations on his work both here and more generally for his chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence . #% The concern we have is that , even in this improved document , the three priorities are so broad and open-ended that they do not really represent any meaningful political choice . #% That is astonishing ! #% The people who expected to be looked after in their old age are now unable to have that care and support because their children are dead . #% However we are willing to look at that if it assists in saving the report . #% Every year several thousands of pounds in weight of illegally-imported bushmeat is seized at London Heathrow airport alone , most of it in an appalling condition . #% What has she got to hide ? #% It did nothing of the sort . #% in writing . - I welcome this resolution , which warns against too much bureaucracy and red tape for SMEs . #% In terms of the pilot projects and preparatory actions , we have a range of different possibilities ; in terms of internal policies , where we are wanting to underpin innovation , and where we are looking in terms of security at a major initiative on migration management , thanks to our friend and colleague Mr Deprez from the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs ; and , last but not least , on external policy , to see what we can do to build up linkages with China and India , because , as reflected from the outset , in the present globalising world we do not have the right kind of networks which link our business and scientists with those of China and India . #% We must remember that we are looking for primary energy savings . #% Who will then buy the works of unknown artists ? #% If I could change those hats - which I can not because I am wearing my hat as the rapporteur - and if I were speaking as a British Labour Member , then I would approve Mrs Buitenweg 's text as it reads well , it is simple , concise and , in particular , it does not make any big deal about own-resources ! #% I say ` hypocritical ' because , of course , there are millions of people in Zimbabwe now who are suffering from food shortages and starvation , much of it as a result of the misguided land policies of President Mugabe . #% EU assistance must be directed to lagging regions and under-represented social groups . #% I very much hope that Parliament will follow the Environment Committee 's lead in removing category from the compulsory scheme and that the Commission and Council too will agree not to impose this additional unnecessary burden on producers and consumers alike . #% You also said that Parliament has a responsibility in supporting the reduction of ECU 1.4 b. #% For example , I was speaking recently with some very senior judges in Germany who were clear , on the basis of the history and traditions of their country , that these matters should be contained in a justiciable charter . #% I hope Member States will stand firm and support a total ban , but they should also be realistic and accommodating . #% There is a clear need for shelter , for food , for medical supplies and I certainly welcome the EUR 750 000 which has been given for this purpose under the ECHO fund , and indeed the promised EUR 225 million from the European Investment Bank for drinking water supply lines . #% The way forward is for joint committees of members of national parliaments and MEPs to oversee the transposition of legislation into national law in every Member State . #% 
It is increasingly destructive of freedom of speech , writing and even thought . #% The EPLP wishes to see a Charter of Fundamental Rights , but until the content of the Charter is determined , the question of giving it binding legal force should be left open . #% It is no longer a technical matter confined to technocrats and has become as much a part of the CFSP as the remit of energy ministers . #% I ask this because there is a disproportionate disadvantage to women in the unemployment figures and the small business sector is , of course , most fertile in terms of producing jobs . #% The geographical location of both countries makes them vulnerable , particularly to trafficking , from eastern Europe especially and from Russia . #% In conclusion , I also hope that the Finnish Presidency will remind Member governments at the Helsinki Council that creating a single market requires that cross-border takeovers and the restructuring of key industries must be allowed to proceed without political interference by Member governments . #% We , and the people in the gallery here , ought to be more passionate and expectant about the enlargement of the European Union because it is a historical goal which we can all be justly proud of . #% My proposition is fundamentally this : Parliament , and I am grateful to those colleagues who are still in the Chamber , should re-focus on human rights and democratisation . #% Member States will , as we have heard , draw up a code of conduct in consultation with the social partners and will give practical guidelines on how employers and employees can meet their obligations in that sector . #% At this , its fifth meeting , there are over 150 000 participants from 150 countries and , amongst the hundreds of meetings , representatives of the IMF and the World Bank face their critics for the first time . #% Also in the context of the so-called war on terror , it is shameful that the British Government withheld from the British Parliament for six weeks a letter from Louise Arbour , the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights , expressing deep concern at some of the proposals in the current anti-terrorism legislation going through the UK national parliament , despite a request that the letter be brought to the attention of the House of Lords . #% We will spend ten percent of what Germany has spent on its reunification . #% Of course , we have still got to deal with the recovery of some of the money which has not yet been got back by the Commission , and these things are being considered and dealt with by the police authorities in at least two countries . #% Advances in engine technology for cars and trucks coupled with a 6 % rise in motorcycle mileage in the 1990s have meant that the proportion of pollution from bikes is increasing . #% I know she will not announce that today . #% That is why we are tabling this amendment , to ensure that training is given on an annual basis . #% The social model needs to be reformed drastically . #% I commend Mrs Ferreira 's report as it stands , with the Commissioner 's proposals . #% Mr President , most people say they believe in open and transparent government . #% Let us make more use of the controls such as port state control . #% It does not now , and that problem has to be dealt with . #% Madam President , a point of order . #% It requires the governments of the world to join together in collective action ; that , of course , is why the critics on the nationalist Right hate it so much . #% I have time to deal with just a few issues . #% My congratulations go out to them . #% Mr President , World Health Day reminds us that access to health is the single most desirable goal that all humans wish to reach . #% How many countries in the Council advocate spending programmes so long as they do not have to pay for them ? #% Initially , the communicable diseases of HIV-AIDS , malaria and TB were included , but now there are plans to extend this list if the WHO thinks it appropriate . #% Who knows ?! #% However , there are other enormous health challenges we must also address . #% The stalling of the talks in Seattle gives us an opportunity to do just that . #% We need to start making practical progress . #% In other words , it is ` yes ... but ' ! #% It will put Greece on the road to a third bail-out , which we will be discussing in a just a few months ' time . #% However , this toothless Parliament passes resolutions that are then ignored by both the Council and the Commission . #% We have to accept the limits of what we can do in saying who can meet where and do what in relation to consumer advice . #% Germany got the recognition of Croatia and former Yugoslavia and , in consequence , a series of interlocking civil wars the results of which colour European history still today , and hence the perpetuation of an absurdity in Strasbourg we all hoped would finally end . #% We also need to make sure that those diagnosed with breast cancer are not discriminated against in the workplace , as we have already heard . #% When we are looking at safe and sustainable pensions , it is a particular problem for women . #% For , by doing so correctly , they contribute towards a goal we all have - a society based on equality and tolerance , where human rights are respected , whatever your gender . #% My colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt is probably as good a lawyer as anyone on the Legal Affairs Committee and it is right that she has tried to make substantial amendments to the proposal from the Commission . #% However , because serious falls from heights do not occur only from scaffolding , the scope has been widened to include protection for workers from all manner of falls from heights . #% This position in my view contravenes Article 49 of the Treaty , of which he is the guardian , unless of course he regards Ukraine as not being a European country . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to express my real and genuine sympathy to all those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own as a result of corporate restructuring . #% We welcome the increased assistance in the agricultural sector , particularly in the life of what we have been told that there is now some recognition that reform has to take place . #% I strongly believe that the ESF has a valuable role to play in training and educating people . #% Agreed by the Council in early October , it provides information on EU action up to June 2005 . #% Questions have to be asked about rating agencies and how they function , but it is premature to reach the conclusion that further regulation or a registration scheme are necessarily needed at this stage . #% We must ensure that this scheme is properly monitored . #% Whilst we sympathise with the approach expressed in Amendment 1 , particularly on decentralisation and co-management , we have difficulties with some of the wording and feel that the points are effectively addressed in paragraph 19 . #% People are becoming defensive about the potential erosion of their languages . #% When I was researching for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on issues relating to the migration of workers , I was told by employers ' organisations that family reunification was a crucial factor in people 's decisions on whether or not they were going to come and work in the European Union . #% We need to have a strong manufacturing base and patents are an important part of developing the industrial output of the European Union . #% It may be , Mr Commissioner , that the Commission together with the US administration could come up with some kind of Green Paper sketching out where the differences are and where the common interests are between America and Europe because as you know , in your previous role , unless America and Europe agree on the major outlines in an international round such as this , we will never conclude . #% We are sending an election observation mission , but we are sending this mission as well . #% There is also the establishment of task assessments which we will do through a series of pilot schemes that will affect around one quarter of the Directorate-Generals in the first instance and then the compilation of job descriptions which will be undertaken over the period up to the end of July this year . #% Who were these 23 prisoners bounced out of prison by armed insurgents ? #% If an official or a former official who is working in the private sector made use of such privileged information , he or she would certainly face disciplinary proceedings . #% As Javier Solana has indicated , the taxpayers in the EU will not be in a position to sustain political activity conducted along violent lines . #% Quality evaluation is one of those . #% It makes it very clear that the new government in the United Kingdom is committed to a solution within a European context . #% The EU institutions should focus their efforts on improving their efficiency in delivering these . #% I wish to make five quick points . #% Public authorities should make a commitment to zero tolerance and public education campaigns should be undertaken to shift the view which is still held in many quarters that violence against women in the family , for example , is a private and minimal matter . #% Nevertheless , it is in the UK 's national interest that Pakistan should now get trade preferences . #% From the evidence available , such cross border B to C disputes are few and far between and the hope is that most of them will now be weeded out by ADR systems . #% 
It would not be proper publicly to pursue the matter further , but when the report of that inspection and the assessment by the Portuguese authorities are available , I am certain that they will be communicated to interested Members including , of course , the chairman of Parliament 's Committee on Fisheries and I am certain the honourable lady whose interest is manifest . #% Indeed , over 18 months after the signing at Cotonou , we can now begin to assess the agreement by looking at the actual progress made in bringing it to life . #% I think that , overall , there is a feeling on both sides that an EU-Japan FTA has the potential to become a true win-win for both sides . #% Little did I know then that since June , the Commission had statistics showing almost a 700 % increase in imports of footwear from China , which indicated the serious state intervention in the sector that the Commission revealed five months later . #% There is no doubt that the code of conduct governing the sale of arms , so that weapons from the EU are not used for internal repression or external aggression , is long overdue . #% My Group accepts that gradual liberalisation is a way forward but only if safety , working conditions and passenger rights are safe-guarded and strengthened . #% We look to the Commission to provide such a rational basis . #% This is even allowing for the fact that it was actually tabled at the beginning of February and got lost . #% I am not sure that we would have any credibility whatsoever as a Parliament or as a European Union if we started to dictate to our citizens what hours they can or can not sleep . #% Given the changing nature of the view of the electorates in both France and Germany - and indeed the UK since the election - and the emphasis that will be placed on jobs , growth and employment rather than on budget-cutting , the position has altered to the extent that there should be a review in the Maastricht timetable . #% What concerns us as well is that the present text again lacks a mechanism for sustainability , that is , an environmental dimension that really must be incorporated into all that we are doing . #% Firstly it ensures traceability of beef products . #% It benefits us sometimes , in our area of freedom , security and justice , to have more bilateral and multilateral agreements , such as the agreement on joint investigation teams , an initiative I was proud to be involved in at the time . #% All abuses by the security forces must be properly investigated . #% We in this Group are wary of the cost of regulation . #% Mr President , from 1 May we can celebrate one of the greatest achievements of the post-war era . #% I would like your assurance that you will be developing the expert capability to what is undoubtedly going to be an increasing workload in looking at future mergers . #% I agree those last few words have now been modified by one of the amendments we accepted , but we would still like to have a separate vote on those last few words of the paragraph . #% Commissioner McCreevy , the point I want to make to you is will you please from now on become the strongest advocate of this directive . #% You say that the directive is based upon all available information . #% I had in fact intended to vote ` Yes ' but my fingers had the ` curse of Pasty ' and I just got it wrong . #% While I recognise , like others , that junior doctors are not the only group affected , this issue has proved the most difficult . #% Heavy industrial users in the north-east of England have had to fight to get hold of gas supplies even at inflated prices because the market is simply not working . #% Given the quantities of mercury rising from the decommissioned chlor-alkali plants within the Community , there would appear to be absolutely no commercial incentive for imports and thus no necessity for including an import ban at this stage . #% None of that can be delivered while terrorists and insurgents pursue their own selfish ends , oppress , intimidate and mobilise Kurdish communities at home and abroad , and seek to inflame international opinion against the Turkish authorities . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I welcome this report and its conclusion that there is no need for a constitutional convention . #% If we do not , we will cease to have any control whatsoever over the situation . #% All of these issues need and deserve the widest possible public debate . #% The British farmers are in crisis at the moment . #% I hope there will be no further comments from the GUE/NGL Group on this subject . #% I will also call upon the Council to accept the reality of Parliament 's clear and unequivocal position . #% Thanks to Liberal Democrats , the UK legislation implementing the measure says that the court must be satisfied there is no breach of the European Convention on Human Rights . #% I would also urge the Commission , Council and Parliament to look seriously at the amendments we have proposed on that . #% A number noticed little points that I had to then retract . #% I can not accept that and I hope Parliament will not either . #% I , although I represent the historic port-town of Dover and am very aware of the need to remember our history , recognise that the maritime sector and in particular , short sea shipping could play a key role in the development of transport policies in the future to fulfil both our economic and our environmental objectives . #% There are seven areas in total , three of which are on the plenary agenda for this week . #% I would say to Mrs Maes in particular that one of the reasons the Council and the Commission have not wanted to take urgent action , as some in this Parliament would perhaps have wanted , is the danger that what Mugabe wants is an excuse to call a state of emergency in Zimbabwe so he can cancel the election , stop the democratic process and stifle the official opposition as well as any opposition from the press and media . #% In a hazardous project as widespread in the west as fighting terrorism , inevitably some mistakes and excesses may have occurred , but in my opinion there was no systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to torture abductees in third countries . #% Our public services simply can not stand mass migration on that scale , and Romania and Bulgaria will lose many of their brightest and best young people into the bargain . #% That does not mean that there is not room to improve the workings of that relationship . #% Making provision for parental leave for Commission staff for the first time , improving working conditions and facilitating flexible employment arrangements such as part-time working are crucial to achieving equality of opportunity and practice and to improving career development . #% We must take note of Russia as it flexes its muscles internationally , but I suggest that a measured , practical approach to maintaining diversity of supply and encouraging appropriate investments to that end must be our response as a long-term solution . #% in writing . - This report sets out Parliament 's plans to better coordinate EU structural funding and European innovation spending as a way of tackling differences between levels of development in regions across the EU , and to sustain regional competitiveness . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council on behalf of my group what steps can be taken during the British Presidency to ensure that it is a proper economic and monetary union . #% For that reason I support the conclusion that we should proceed at all possible speed with enlargement negotiations with the six countries named . #% The way to bring down the value of the euro is for the ECB to reduce interest rates . #% The addition of propaganda that the EU is somehow involved in the subsequent peace is objectionable to me and to the seven members of my family who fought in that war against the Axis . #% The EU trawlers then move on , leaving a deeply wounded economy : fishermen out of work and waters deprived of stock , so that the locals can not restart properly . #% Thank you for your response . #% The countryside is flooded with military personnel , and orders have gone out to kill people in groups of four or less in a sickening attempt to reduce the number of recorded massacres without any real diminution in the grisly death toll afflicting the country . #% Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ? #% On Friday we , in the United Kingdom , will mark the anniversary of the horrific events of 7 July 2005 , when 52 of our citizens were blown up in a terrorist attack . #% Mr President , I should like to say at the outset that I totally agree with the rapporteur that the current backlog of funding is completely unacceptable and that urgent action is now required to salvage the situation . #% Last year 's drought coupled with the invasion of locusts , followed by drought this year , have combined with an increase in food prices , which have tripled in rural areas and doubled in cities , partly as a result of demand from neighbouring countries such as Nigeria . #% For brevity , I hope that the House will permit me to deal only with the main ones . #% I would like to ask the Commission - and I know you may not be able to answer now , but I will write to you on this point if I may - if he could give this Parliament an indication of how much of the existing telecommunications legislation has been formally transposed by the Member States and also how many of the Member States really are implementing that legislation and what steps the national regulatory authorities have taken . #% Therefore , we abstained on this vote , because education should be about informing students rather than promoting any one idea . #% The idea that paid maternity leave will encourage women to have children is naive . #% I thank the President-in-Office for what is clearly good news for the European Union . #% As anyone who has been on a bicycle knows : if you stop , it falls over . #% Indeed it would be counter to the Treaty , which states that the Commission is `` fully associated '' , not partially associated , with the CFSP and that it will remain the Commission 's choice whether to participate or not . #% I must say that I find the lack of any legal justification in terms of European Community law and the European Convention on Human Rights somewhat distressing . #% They want to retreat from the ordinary law towards Council law and to remove Parliament 's last word on the budget . #% We have got to protect public health . #% I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to ensure this money did not come from the ` Progress ' programme , which is designed to help vulnerable people , but was created using money from the 2010 budget for the first year . #% 
One is specifically to the Council : it must make rapid progress on allowing the SAR passport-holders visa-free access throughout the 15 Member States . #% Amendment No 100 facilitates this continued ban . #% It is not a single standard , and just having a single standard does not mean you automatically get simple authoring or interoperability . #% Running alongside this , the efforts we make on conflict prevention and the peace facility proposed for the African Union , etc. will play their part in addressing some of the concerns raised here today . #% The Australian government was perfectly entitled to exercise its sovereign right under the law of the sea to secure its borders by refusing the ship access to Australian waters . #% There is also a clear gap in that the International Energy Agency allows only for strategic oil reserves , not for gas reserves . #% Without those actions there would indeed have been a terrible mass murder . #% It is awfully nice of the Council to tell us that it will inform us afterwards , but we - the only democratic body in the EU - would like to be consulted as it negotiates whether or not it is currently written in the Treaty . #% There will be a review after five years and the Commission may reconsider the commitment to phasing out delegation after eight years . #% The committee voted by 11 votes to 8 to suppress a scientific report on inedibles , in respect of which the European Academy of Sciences ' advisory committee stated : ` This report is , overall , a reasonable , impartial and balanced piece of work on a very difficult topic . ' #% We are also talking about Central and Eastern Europe and that is why I wonder whether we should not pause for a little thought before we push too far ahead with a radical revision of this proposal . #% I want us to see carbon prices rise so we drive forward the low carbon investments in the future . #% The mechanics needed to achieve this change are very extensive , as can be seen from even the most cursory examination of Lord Cockfield 's 1992 programme , one of the most revolutionary , yet on the face of it unexciting programmes of the post-war world . #% This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957 . #% Mr President , on behalf of the British Members of this House , may I thank the President of Parliament , through you , for his words of sympathy , and extend the sympathy of my colleagues and of colleagues across all parties from my country in this House at what has happened in Istanbul . #% He really has tried very hard to get us to the situation where this House will give a great deal of support to his ideas tomorrow . #% The more examples we have , the easier it is to ensure a long-term peaceful solution to border problems . #% We must also ensure that using the open coordination method does not reduce asylum policy to the lowest common denominator of Member States ' current policies . #% With regard to the removal of the vertebral column , you have brought up the question : where should it take place , abattoir or at the point of sale ? #% I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France 's Loi et Vin , which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France ? #% Have a guess : the regional assemblies accountable directly to Brussels . #% I welcome the very full introduction to the debate from Sir Leon Brittan . #% The provisions of the report will lead to an unacceptable increase in the amount of tests carried out on animals . #% We have challenging times ahead . #% Adam Smith declared that the sole end and purpose of all economic activity is consumption . #% This seems an ironic lurch towards a protectionist position at the very time when here in Europe and in this Parliament we are about to embark upon a debate on the latest raft of measures which , in my view , would make the European Union telecoms market the most liberalised and the most open market in the world going way beyond many if not all of the commitments into which we entered in GATT and the WTO . #% A tragedy for the people involved , a tragedy for their family and friends , but also a tragedy for Europe and the European ideal . #% If you had achieved that , I would have been delighted to support the directive . #% This year 's report is more balanced , but it still sends a lukewarm message . #% That is why we should use the political dialogue to maintain Europe 's opposition to the military solution represented by Plan Colombia , to condemn human rights abuses on all sides in the Colombian tragedy , to insist that Colombia abide by all the commitments made in the London Declaration of 2003 and to act as advocates for grassroots projects , such as the EU-funded peace laboratories , which truly point the way to a just and lasting peace for Colombia . #% The market is being flooded with imports from other European countries which do not have the same hygiene standards as we have in the United Kingdom . #% Radiation affects 23 % of the territory of Belarus . #% It is that problem that this particular proposal aims to tackle . #% This would not be so bad if our government made manufacturers liable from that date , as it has the possibility to do under the directive , before manufacturers ' liability becomes mandatory in January 2007 . #% We have all agreed with Baron Lamfalussy and his wise men that effective regulation of financial markets and the creation of a single financial market require us to delegate powers to the Commission and to a more nimble official committee . #% But I believe that the proper route for disposal is incineration in a high temperature incinerator . #% Violence between people who know each other , such as partners , needs to be treated extremely seriously by the authorities . #% I regret that Mr Nassauer has ignored what the rapporteur said about the use of language and has talked about `` burden sharing '' , because the issue is actually how different Member States accept their responsibilities and try to treat people in very desperate circumstances fairly . #% However , whilst I am grateful for the Commissioner 's statement today , my group is still disappointed with the Commission as it appears that it has not used its right of initiative and has not engaged itself fully on this topic . #% One journalist even suggested that the lack of a unified system was in part responsible for the incident . #% Most of this report represents the very worse of politically correct claptrap . #% Mr President , the advantage or disadvantage of speaking late is that much of what I was going to say has already been said , so I will just reinforce three general points . #% I believe that those sitting behind Mr Őry and trying to undermine his work think that , with the stalling of much of Europe 's social agenda , they have a chance to push for deregulation and the renationalisation of important elements of the social legal base . #% All of these things are considered in our health programme and I have taken on board the message that you are sending . #% Mr President , I too , would like to add my congratulations to Mr Hume and Mr Trimble on the award of the peace prize and express the hope that it is not a premature award . #% Figures published recently by the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao suggest enormous variations between Member States in the incidence of falls from heights . #% The Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty lays down in its Article 4 ( 3 ) the provisions for providing ` mutual assistance in the event of disruption ' -- see the Treaty 's Title IV , Chapter IV . #% Entry into the Union should trigger inward investment , which Romania badly needs . #% It is overdue in that , for a long time , there has been a need to give poorer countries assisted access to drugs . #% I am certain that they will follow previous practice in making enquiries of the Chinese authorities as to the quality and consistency of the treatment of Mr Xu for hepatitis . #% The thrust of my report is that the textiles industry is really just the tip of the iceberg . #% I suppose in a way it was worth waiting . #% Mr Marinho 's report is part of that initiative by the French , Swedish and Belgian governments and I congratulate him and them on this report . #% Do not try and negotiate , or re-negotiate , the common agricultural policy in the space of two or three months to get us to October and the Brussels Summit . #% For instance , it has just cut business tax , along with income tax , to a competitive flat rate of 19 % ; this is most worrying to its neighbour Austria , which fears that businesses will relocate over the border . #% Mr President , I am sorry to see that the idea of insisting on bottling at source has crept into Mr Martin 's otherwise excellent report . #% I hope that the Commissioner will be able to finish this debate by telling us exactly how much work has already been done over the past three years in preparing the groundwork for publication of the shark management action plan . #% Natural justice and fair play should demand that Turkey be treated in the same way as other candidate countries to the European Union . #% Could Mr Sasi confirm the presidency will draft such new language ? #% I have been deeply concerned at some of the arguments put forward by certain governments which have said that other aspects of health provision could be threatened if the reduction of working time for this group was brought in more quickly . #% These are just three of many thousands of cases of injustice suffered by European citizens owning property in Spain . #% The policy is failing and will continue to do so under its present structure . #% The Postal Directive seeks to impose value added tax on postage at a time when letter writing is under great competition from e-mail . #% As a result , Channel Tunnel freight services are now in a state of deep crisis . #% An estimated 1 , 250 people who fled abroad after the civil war are afraid to return and have had their property confiscated . #% Mr President , this is the second urgent resolution on Zimbabwe that we have put forward in just over three months . #% 
The Liberal Group wishes to improve access across the board for the citizen , to improve citizens ' approach to their constitutional court . #% As a Briton , I am happy to support Portugal in its attempts to secure a just outcome , not only because Portugal is Britain ' s oldest ally , but also because Portugal should be given the opportunity to grant independence to all its colonies , including its last colony now , other than Macao , namely East Timor . #% Finally , I want to come to the question of national symbols on the single currency . #% Mr President , as Chairman-in-Office of the College of Quaestors , I wish to point out for the purposes of the Rules that my Group is present but not taking part in the vote . #% In my own country the abolition of re-sale price-fixing for books has coincided with an increase in numbers of books sold and published . #% Fluctuations in exchange rates add a further hazard in terms of forward planning . #% The intention of the coalition , led by the United States , to eradicate terrorism deserves the support of the European democracies in particular . #% I know he is extremely proud of being the rapporteur for the Marco Polo Programme and is looking forward to its passing through Parliament later this week . #% For the British , having no formal written constitution and having been a unitary country until quite recently , systematic analysis of the kind we are considering this evening is especially unfamiliar . #% But what is particularly striking here , apart from the fact that we already have an independent intergovernmental agency in the Joint Aviation Authority , is the stark admission that continued intergovernmental cooperation is to be abandoned as it is developed and I quote from the rapporteur 's report : `` would have involved lengthy ratification procedures in the national parliaments of the states concerned ... , which would not necessarily have been successful '' . #% Why should they be interested in the intricacies of codecision if their children face such an uncertain future ? #% Mr President , as we debate an area of freedom , security and justice it is somewhat derisory that this proposed area extends all over Europe but does not appear to be available here in the European Parliament . #% The proposed system of reporting risk and threat assessments to the Commission merely creates additional bureaucratic burdens and structures . #% Only a month ago , I reminded the House that pensions were exclusively the competence of the Member States and here we go again using the same language of coordination and retirement-setting mechanisms . #% So I urge people to go for the block compromise and support the first two parts in its entirety . #% We have said that where there is a majority of over 90 % in committee , we can take that prima facie as not controversial . #% Will the Council take those positive steps to correct this lack of human rights ? #% We should strive to do that in the most reasonable and practicable way . #% My message to you is quite simple : this is a great device , it will save lives , it will save money , but we need the public authorities to get their finger out and get on with this , because they are the ones who are dragging us back . #% There are choices : either we allow globalisation to roll on without guidance or we rein it in to ensure that it brings benefits to all . #% We are talking about significant amounts of money here . #% If we can break one prostitution ring with this directive , that alone would have been worth it . #% We have just learnt that Dr Donny George , Director of the Iraq Museum and one of the most high-profile Assyrians within the country , has fled to Syria with his family . #% However , I would like to broadly commend and support this proposal . #% I am delighted that has happened . #% The main problem was that over 50 % of the population did not live in the homes they lived in five years ago . #% I regret , therefore , that Robin Cook has not found it possible to come here , although he spent the whole of yesterday afternoon in the House of Commons . #% Madam President , first of all I should like to put Mr Posselt right : the first person to ring Chancellor Schröder after his election was the British Prime Minister . #% There are those who are nervous and say , well , let us just use the idea of a toolbox . #% Mr President , I proposed two amendments to this report . #% Full pressure must be maintained to deprive him of all weapons of mass destruction . #% We , in this House , know that is not true . #% Rather than reflecting and promoting the clear majority views of members of the European Parliament 's Employment Committee , she has actively worked to promote the view of the Commission and Council . #% Mr President , I also wish to welcome our Romanian colleagues , in particular to my own group , from the Romanian Democratic Party , the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania and the Romanian Conservative Party . #% A split vote has been asked for on that matter and I would ask all groups to consider carefully how they will vote . #% But now I understand the reason : it is because Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is seeking it as a device to be able to speak earlier in the debate than he otherwise would . #% Each is valued for her contribution . #% We need resources , but they must be efficiently targeted . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , thank you , Commissioner , for your very careful statement . #% However , the printers of the relevant British parliamentary records and documents this week announced major redundancies with hundreds being made redundant in Norwich and elsewhere . #% Does he not agree that would be a total misuse of public funds ? #% A global network of protected forest areas must be established and funded , and countries must set measurable time-ban targets to ensure that the use , consumption and trade of biodiversity resources come only from sustainable sources . #% That is why this directive is so important and why tonight I am pleased to welcome the progress that has been made in Council to reach a common position which will force ships to dispose of their waste at port reception facilities . #% While I do not want the closure of existing nuclear plants , I am not in favour of their massive expansion , with all the problems that poses for health and the environment . #% These elections may be six months later than planned , but that is a drop in the ocean for the generations who have longed to exercise their democratic rights . #% In many ways the enlargement of the European Union is comparable to the tour de France . #% Consideration must also be given to a rescheduling or writing-off of huge foreign debts which rose for Latin America as a whole from $ 83bn in 1975 to $ 627bn in 1996 . #% However , even if only a few are refugees , they must be identified . #% With unemployment approaching 5 million in that country , the swamp is getting bigger and the need for change is very clear . #% To do otherwise is to collude in limiting the availability of products many consumers might choose to purchase . #% The Jukun and Tiv disputes are about land and ancient rivalries , not about religion . #% Firstly , I sense a perception that this whole idea about a multimedia home platform ( MHP ) is somehow a silver bullet , a magic cure that will , in one sweep , create universal accessibility for digital television . #% That , I think , is a factor of very great importance in trying to achieve this focus and this synthesis of ideas . #% People in that area are now desperately anxious to get back to normal life , and we would strongly recommend that there should be no complacency shown when it comes to this directive . #% I wonder if his own MEPs do . #% It is more a stocktaking exercise than one that will encourage a broader transatlantic partnership . #% Whether a director in the boardroom , surgeon in the hospital , part-time care assistant , car mechanic or housewife and mother , a woman has the right to make her own choice . #% GDP is over 100 % of the European average . #% We recognise , of course , that further work needs to be done on this question . #% For more than half a century fusion was to deliver ` tomorrow ' , but the day has never come . #% That is a very real and practical benefit to the people who elected us to serve in this House on their behalf . #% It would be splendid if this report could be adopted by a large majority in Parliament . #% Both Mrs Scallon and I would definitely like to see more training places available if we are to stop this decline . #% I have more than once drawn the attention of this House to the dangers of indiscriminate additions of substances such as antibiotics or other medicaments to animal feed , not to deal with a particular , temporary health problem of an individual animal , but as general prophylactics . #% It is probably the single most important physical link drawing Britain and the continent together . #% Some 36 million people have been flooded , which is more than the population of the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg , Denmark and Ireland put together . #% 
In conclusion , it must be right to emphasize that sustainable trade , investment and economic development can not be achieved in the absence of the development of democracy , the rule of law , civil society and human rights . #% I am grateful to the honourable Member as he points out the consequences of efforts to reach the continent of Europe are often terribly tragic , involving large numbers of casualties and deaths . #% I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime . #% I think there are dangers of overreaction and some Members have referred to that . #% Next time a minister returns home and blames Brussels for interfering , remind him or her that it is national ministers sitting in the Council who have approved the legislation in question in the first place . #% Yet we are now faced with the prospect of harmonising driving licences , and this report makes clear that harmonising penalties for driving offences can not be far behind . #% I presume that this agreement will cover scientific and technological research in the Kaesong Industrial Zone jointly administered by North and South Korea , and in that I am sure the Republic of Korea will welcome our commitment that is currently withheld by Washington . #% We can not support those suggestions in the resolution that would lead to a Financial Perspective higher than agreed at the European Council in December 2005 . #% As for Turkey , there is still much work for it to do by itself , including on the treatment of trade unionists and human rights for the Kurdish and Assyrian minorities before it would be in a political position to join , even if it manages to achieve the economic criteria required of new members . #% I ask this because of the issue of coherence , the subject of this morning ' s discussion . #% Whilst we are subsidising our agriculture , farmers and poorer people in countries all around the world are going under because they are unable to compete . #% Firstly , that it should be made clear that any proposals for a possible mandate extension should not divert attention from the key task of completing trials and moving towards the earliest possible closure . #% Mugabe 's absolute contempt for international opinion was further demonstrated by his defiance towards the EU troika which visited Harare at the end of November . #% This is the second time this year that this session has been arbitrarily cancelled . #% As a Parliament in Europe we believe in promoting good health , helping social integration and recognizing the needs of the disabled . #% What I want to say , is that we need to have more questions asked than this kind of tokenism . #% As an integral part of that , it is crucial to ensure that we have the instruments in place to benchmark and give access ratings to websites , because public comparison and encouragement of best practice will stimulate everybody to move forward . #% I read recently that in the new Member States , as many as 40 % of workers are affected by ill-health or injury related to work . #% The EU and Tony Blair deserve each other . #% You are criticising your own colleagues as well . #% When we hear the phrase ` long gestation periods ' we have tended hitherto to think of elephants . #% We do have to take into account the extensive use , for very young children in particular , of products which have been flavoured and sweetened in this way . #% The committee has therefore sought to make it explicit that the scope of any regulation needs to apply equally to exports , as well as to domestic sale and consumption . #% This measure today , being an internal market directive , is part of the package designed to open up the EU market to competition and enable telecoms and ISPs to operate on a level playing field . #% All of these developments are important and very welcome . #% Can the presidency deliver ? #% It is important that we avoid burying ourselves under the proliferation of packaging consumer society imposes on us . #% European Member States need to collude and pool their separate specialisms and create a system of ` benchmarking ' . #% It went on to say , from a US point of view : `` when it comes to putting the consumer at the center of its economic model , Europe remains stubbornly old-fashioned . '' #% It is unacceptable when Parliament is exercising its responsibility in relation to the budget , and when the Committee on Budgets is following the decision of the Bureau of Parliament , that there should be a demonstration which is being personalized against both the Secretary-General and this Parliament 's rapporteur as in the case with the performance which is going on at the moment . #% As has been mentioned , we are already seeing a shift in production from the European Union to other countries . #% There was disappointment that we are not more fully engaged but a determination that we should be better engaged in the next stage of the process . #% The Fabra Vallés report is an attempt to bring closer together the expertise , the experience and the best practices , not only of the European Union but also of the Member States to replace the present sixteen different and uncoordinated systems . #% However , we have to recognise that changing a system is not easy and that China in many ways is actually a developing country , not a developed country . #% However , there is nothing whatsoever in these proposals that in any way outlaws sustainable or environmentally friendly procurement . #% The ECB proposal would create a third class of Member State with fewer chances of voting and , outrageously , only candidate countries would be in this inferior grouping . #% It is absolute madness to expect anything from a piece of paper signed by Putin , any more than we would from one signed by Adolf Hitler . #% On a slightly different topic , the ALDE Group welcomes Amendment 11 proposing that funding for the operating costs of regional advisory councils should not be restricted to the first five years . #% I am sure that there must be similar operations in Europe that might be termed ` social carriers ' . #% Instead of setting levels now for Member States , we should monitor the concentrations of substances in the sediment and biota with a view to reaching a framework standard . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I speak not on behalf of my group , but as a Member who has seen things he did not wish to see . #% I recognise the Danish Presidency 's enthusiasm for wishing to carve out a road from Copenhagen to Copenhagen , but I want to be clear that Copenhagen is not the end of the process - hopefully it is the beginning of the end of the process . #% I have never been and will not be one who advises members of Lloyd 's -- ` Names ' -- who have suffered financially to pursue a case with no expectation of success . #% My understanding is that Member States are rejecting that approach . #% Everything should be done so that children of separated parents have the best possible chance of contact with both their parents , providing one of the parents is not going to try and abduct them , with the likelihood of a loving and secure upbringing . #% They happen to believe they are right in saying there should be no legislative changes and I am not going to debate that particular point now . #% Money spent by a politician is nearly always wasted . #% As she is good enough to come here at this time , we should finish our debate properly . #% My Group supports the motion because it is a small step in the right direction . #% Mr President , I do not believe the Commission has done enough to address the problems in different Member States . #% Of course that will also be relevant in the application of PVC to medical goods . #% Mr President , I have just returned from a meeting with President Chissano of Mozambique , with whom you and President Prodi met this morning . #% However , we must take small steps . #% The fact is that most of the people of Bulgaria , through all these difficulties and upheavals , have seen little improvement in their own lives and standards of living . #% It is not ideal , but it is suitable to tide us over until the new constitution comes into force , which will introduce a new category of delegated legislation giving us further powers under the terms of the constitution . #% Mr President , I would like to draw your attention to the Agenda . #% The Presidency-in-Office of the Council clearly thought it more important to make a telephone call than to answer our questions . #% The Sudanese government has ignored UN Security Council resolutions on human rights . #% To bury business in yet more red tape would , in his eyes , be completely the wrong approach , notwithstanding the need for efficient scrutiny of how the money is spent and how effective the programme is proving to be . #% Thank you for all the work you did , Commissioner , and may it continue . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner one question in two halves . #% It is set to continue - and why ? #% As the honourable Member will know , the longstanding policy of the Union is to raise the individual cases of Chinese citizens who have been in prison for political offences with the Chinese authorities , particularly in the context of the human rights dialogue , the last meeting of which took place on 25 February this year . #% It gives me very great pleasure to thank and support the Council for everything that it has said today on this complicated issue . #% We are currently 15 Member States , soon to be 25 . #% There are , of course , many risks with equity investments , but there are even greater risks to Europe with stagnant economies . #% 
We all share the view that confident , well-informed consumers , empowered to make choices , are at the foundation of a successful internal market . #% As the Commissioner rightly says , the burden deserves to be shared . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur who is one of the most imaginative Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights . #% That will be the effect and it is the antithesis of what is needed . #% Progress in this area can not be made overnight and , in the meantime , the interests of desperate people , understandably fleeing from conflict , persecution or other hardship , are not well served by pushing them into the hands of the unscrupulous and those seeking to make money out of trafficking people . #% I pay credit to you Mr Prodi , and to your colleagues Mr Patten , Mr Barnier and others , for having succeeded in restoring this poise after the resignation of your predecessors . #% The European Union is often accused of having a democratic deficit . #% But some of the difficulties raised we found difficult to credit . #% This is certainly not the intention of the Commission nor of Parliament . #% The decision to move towards low sulphur diesel across the Union should mean an end to the noisy , smelly , expensive and rather larger diesel engines and other off-road vehicles that disturb our air quality , the peace of our environment and communities . #% Membership for Turkey will be a two-way process . #% Unfortunately , that hope has been dissipated as today we discuss Financial Perspective proposals that reflect lower levels of growth for the Development Cooperation Instrument than is the case for all Europe 's other external actions . #% However , 100 , 000 mines were cleared last year and 2 million new ones laid . #% It would be the worst possible start if this body were sited in an inappropriate place for the worst of reasons . #% There are many interinstitutional agreements that are annexed to the Rules of Procedure without having the optional extra of a particular reference in the Rules of Procedure themselves to the text annexed . #% Whilst I hear what my colleague , Mrs Hardstaff , has said , we hope that our colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will listen to what we say about the need to encourage consumer confidence in foodstuffs , which is also in the interests of the primary producers themselves . #% In this context , the Commission 's proposal looks attractive in that it provides the mechanisms for affording a response to crisis situations . #% We need to know also why it is that many of our projects still do not really recognize the vulnerability of women and are , as the Commission has already said elsewhere , very often gender-blind . #% REACH has been sold to a naive public as a panacea for a better world , ` switch selling ' , I suggest , of the shoddiest kind . #% That is the first thing we need to have clarified . #% Of course that is the one thing that you people do not want , is n't it ? #% I am proud to support such a resolution . #% Thirdly , a question addressed to the Socialist Group - is it Socialist Group policy to support Amendment 25 by Mr Hendrick which is calling for the harmonisation of capital gains tax in Europe ? #% That is hardly surprising , with the alleged massacres of hundreds , and possibly thousands , of civilians perpetuated in Nimba County since the signing of the agreement . #% It underpins our European work on the critical issues of discrimination and social exclusion that continue to hold back so many people in our societies . #% Member States must also cooperate with partner countries to ensure the protection of vulnerable groups and to fight gender discrimination as well as discrimination on grounds of ethnicity , religion , age and disability . #% I hope you will pursue them and I hope the Council will pursue them , too . #% The positive side of all this was the strengthening of our collective belief in the force of community across the globe , with the outpouring of aid and goodwill from governments and individuals alike . #% I do not think it would be helpful to link the question of concessions on bananas at the WTO with other disputes which the European Union has with the USA at the WTO . #% That is to say that I would not be content if the power was vested elsewhere in the EU , because the greatest sensitivity is that we as a country are having trade agreements affecting the UK negotiated and finalised by a third party , which may or may not be entirely in our national interests . #% Notwithstanding this reservation the delegation supports the overall stance of the Vander Taelen report . #% Enlargement is first and foremost a security issue . #% The ISO standards report , the only one that was really up to date , actually said that there was no quantitative link between whole body vibration and lower back pain , but still we brought legislation forward . #% But I would point out to my British colleague that he agreed with the UK government that Article 234 of the Treaty did in fact render this conflict invalid . #% Collateral is required by non-US companies in the United States . #% The only sensible recourse for us to take is to postpone discharge , and we need to have much deeper inquiries into the accounting systems reforms that have been put forward so far . #% In conclusion , I look forward to hearing the views of the European Parliament and those of the Commission on the report itself , and on the various issues that it covers . #% I do not think any blame for the problem lies with you because you do not have many battalions at your disposal ! #% Madam President , I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 179 dealing with relations with the Ombudsman . #% The opinion from the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy on the Schnellhardt report , for which I was the draftsperson , focuses in particular on the need for consistency between food safety practices , which are deemed essential for the domestic sale or supply of foodstuffs , and those practices which cover the sale of such foodstuffs internationally . #% Iraq has the capacity to be the wealthiest nation in the globe per capita with her oil and other resources . #% This is not interference in national responsibilities , but an assertion that the non-discriminatory delivery of these services is a European concern . #% In some cases that particular position could jeopardise security itself . #% As she says , it must not be based on the lowest common denominator ; rather , a system that will gain the most respect and be the least subject to criticism will be based on the highest possible standards , will respect families , and will respect human rights . #% On the test of internal stability , with inflation at less that 2 % and growth higher at 3.1 % in the euro zone than in Britain , the euro is clearly succeeding . #% I was delighted that your approach is to try and avoid putting a brake on innovation by excessively firm controls . #% It is clearly desirable that Member States share information and best practice on how these problems should be addressed and sections of this report do provide some useful ideas . #% These cases demonstrate the need for the World Anti-Doping Agency to harmonise disciplinary procedure that would safeguard the rights of athletes but , at the same time , swiftly punish those who knowingly take drugs and are guilty of taking drugs . #% The agreement is to provide a global advanced purchasing scheme to make sure that life-saving vaccines are commercially produced at affordable prices and that these are produced in ways of which we in this Parliament should all approve and which we should find essential at this time . #% The people who vote for me make these products . #% What will it cost in terms of the social , political and economic dislocation which will inevitably follow ? #% But I , like many others , sadly underestimated the ferocity of the subsequent insurgency and the serious lack of peace planning , post-invasion , by our US allies , in particular their disastrous dismantling of the Iraqi army as a de-Baathification measure , which unleashed disgruntled Sunni officers to lend their expertise to the insurgency . #% And the time has come I think for us to put up our hands and admit that we got it wrong in 2008 . #% Mrs Korhola gave a very nice speech -- it is a pity she has now left the Chamber -- but she did not explain why she has put her name to this very same amendment , which would gut and weaken the very resolution which she claims to support . #% What is important about this report is that they have resisted the temptation to complicate what was basically a simple text proposed by the Commission . #% Whilst Conservative MEPs support anything which enhances cooperation between Member States ' law enforcement agencies , we can not support any prescriptive European measures such as those proposed in this Report . #% Pressure to develop alternatives must now be put on the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries , which use the same tests . #% We would like to see this changed so that we are at least given observer status in EU meetings at such conferences . #% The process , therefore , is clearly unsustainable . #% And what mechanism - I know democracy is not popular with you lot - what mechanism do the peoples of Europe have to remove you ? #% And that is the core of the guidelines we are presenting to you today . #% The Greens and EFA were calling for a complete ban on the production , export and use of depleted uranium weapons and we believe that we have a legal as well as a moral basis for doing so . #% Mr President , I speak for the Socialists from the point of view of Parliament 's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% It has taken you eight and a half years of bullying , of lying , of ignoring democratic referendums . #% My party is not a great party for harmonisation but we are a party for harmony and that is what we have seen in this report and the way it has been dealt with . #% Whilst we expressed some concerns about this , we are prepared to support the idea of discharge on the basis that the new head of the DG for Health will investigate these issues and bring forward a report to the House . #% 
As regards solidarity between the Member States , Parliament wanted binding mechanisms , Council wanted to entrench the voluntary nature of cooperation , and the final language is more neutral , but we do have an external evaluation of the Asylum Support Office to look forward to , which will cover the Support Office 's impact on practical cooperation on asylum . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - May I return to EU-US relations just for a moment to say how pleased that I and my group - my group being a major group in this context - are to hear about the SWIFT agreement progress which we have been very much involved with . #% As a result of petitions , that has been stopped and British Customs and Excise has been told that it must stop confiscating not just the wine , but also the cars of British citizens . #% Only if all parties show restraint that will we prevent further violence , otherwise it is the ordinary citizens , yet again , who will suffer . #% Most of all , I welcome the fact that we now have collective responsibility to protect civilians against genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and all crimes against humanity . #% I have some questions for Mr Solana . #% Firstly , I believe that the industrial waste exporters have mistakenly given an unnecessarily exaggerated and frightening picture of the present situation to the charitable organizations . #% The population of 127 million is likely to grow to over 200 million by 2030 . #% They now have to work in practice . #% There are three things which I would like to emphasise in particular in this Parliament Budget 2001 . #% So we accept that there should be increased expenditure on the new priorities but we also think it was time we looked again at the traditional priorities , so here again , it was another missed opportunity for the European budget . #% It is there not just to revitalise our bodies but also our minds and our souls , and we have to recognise the importance of that fact in European legislation . #% What is known is that these donations were obtained by a man called Will Howard , who was a member of the Communist Party in Great Britain . #% We in Europe can work with you to achieve those aims . #% So what of modernisation ? #% What we require is for the European Council to establish a rendez-vous with a decision in the autumn of 2007 , setting up a fresh conference to renegotiate Part 3 of the Constitution . #% Firstly , those tabled to allow Member States to set their own limits in particular local circumstances . #% It is decentralization which builds the capacity of civil society to monitor and assure norms of democracy , thereby promoting principles of good governance and respect for human rights . #% For my group , this is an essential point . #% In other words , the Commission would ` possibly ' take account of Parliament 's objections and the Commission would ` possibly ' amend its text to take account of our views . #% We can only allow the continued use of certain other substances where there is a genuine threat of smuggling into the Union of other supplies that might be used to continue supporting existing equipment . #% The amendments I have tabled propose ongoing support for farmers in Objective 1 and 5b areas , switching to types of tobacco which will eventually be able to compete on the market without subsidy , and assistance for new types of agriculture or other jobs on a scale never enjoyed by the hundreds of thousands of miners , steel workers , shipbuilders , fishermen and others who have lost their jobs through restructuring over the last two decades . #% . Mr President , you will be very familiar with the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly , having been a very effective and hard-working Vice-President of it in the past . #% Compromise is the whole notion on which the European project was built in the early 1950s and in 1957 . #% I note that on page 34 of the English version it emphasizes fire safety in hotels , and presumably in hostels as well . #% The Commission has got to be fair , but it has to be tough . #% It seems strange to me that she was imprisoned on her way here because she represents the South East of England and was arrested five or six hundred miles further north . #% Since we have failed to keep our side of the bargain , we can not be surprised if other countries ignore our pleas for their disarmament . #% I ask you to support the appropriate amendments . #% Therefore my sympathy , to some extent , is with the rapporteur in being presented with an issue of this complexity . #% Lithuania and Slovakia were specifically mentioned by the Council last week . #% Far too often Parliament passes amendments on important legislation with no consideration for its impact . #% Does he agree with me that it was particularly discreditable for Mr Poettering to bring such pressure to bear on the British Conservatives , given that we were elected on a manifesto commitment to oppose fraud and corruption ? #% When we worked on the issue of industrial noise , we were accused of trying to ban bagpipe playing in Scotland . #% It was awful to see that speed . #% It is important that we get sensible rules that will encourage growth of the Internet and electronic commerce . #% I would also like to thank Mr Karas for all the very hard work he has done on a very difficult report . #% There is much greater transparency in arms controls policies . #% Whatever the reasons for it , it does not help consumer confidence . #% One of our concerns relates to the fact that certain members of the Council say that we should accept that we deduct EUR 0.3 billion for the EU 's 21 overseas countries and territories and that a further EUR 0.9 billion should be deducted to cover administrative costs . #% We would like to see that document . #% My group is determined that the specific legitimacy of the European Parliament to play a part in the constitutional development of the Union should be recognised inside the convention . #% Mr President , I was the shadow rapporteur for the PSE on this . #% At the end of the 19th century , we had the internal combustion engine and the car , which brought great advantages but obviously certain problems such as pollution and congestion . #% Finally , on the scope of the Atalanta mission , we note calls in the resolution for its expansion to be considered . #% Madam President , Mrs Junker says in her report that men must take greater responsibility for social and reproductive behaviour if we are to truly promote the aim of equality for women in developing countries and therefore it is right that the male Members of the European Parliament take part in this debate and support her excellent report to protest against the denial of adequate reproductive health facilities to women across the world . #% The young 14-year old girl raped on a highway in Africa : does she have a choice ? #% I hope that when he publishes the macroeconometric model he will do so in a form which makes it available and easily usable by outside researchers , perhaps on CD-ROM . #% She should be released immediately and unconditionally . #% I have a very simple question . #% Mr President , I should explain that I am the non-executive chairman of a medium-sized regional media group in the United Kingdom . #% Mr President , it becomes clear that the Socialists are shifting ground as we go through this debate . #% I know there are heated discussions in the Council , and many nations have withdrawn their support for now , or are a bit uncertain . #% Mr President , this Summit is scheduled to be , in part at least , a stocktaking exercise on the European Constitution . #% Finally , regarding tourism , I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs , and especially Mrs Torres Marques for her report . #% We should all want to see a high level of social protection and learn from each other via the exchange of best practice at European level but , ultimately , it is national strategies that have to deliver . #% I now come to another request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists , this time to remove the following item , `` Tibet '' . #% I take issue with one or two points in Mr Hoppenstedt 's report , in particular item 5 , which talks about privatization as being necessary in order to liberalize . #% This should be seen as another dimension to the war on terrorism . #% I will pay tribute to the support we have had from the budget rapporteur this year and from the Commission , but the Council is absent this afternoon . #% This means perhaps looking again at all our educational programmes to see that they match the programmes we are particularly enthusiastic about . #% Clearly the cross-border delivery of professional services by people whose qualifications are mutually and unimpeachably recognised , in a manner that addresses the issues of quality and consumer protection raised by a number of my colleagues , is an absolutely indispensable part of that move forward to complete the internal market . #% In 1998 we have witnessed further progress under the CSFP and many of these have been outlined by the President-in-Office , particularly , I would say , the successful launch of the historic enlargement process . #% The debate referred to by Mr Fitzsimons was one that I saw when I was Northern Ireland Minister . #% In the Socialist Group , we particularly support the high priority given to making sure that we include in the Sixth Framework Programme work on the Next Generation Internet , and that we develop a broad-banded infrastructure capability and a new super fast trans-European research network . #% She is right to make that call . #% 
I feel enormous sympathy for people that live in poverty and fear . #% I was very interested in the Commissioner 's response and her definition of languages , which is well known in this House . #% I would advise you now to go forward to the vote . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his concise and clear answer . #% It would appear to us that shipping lines and insurers are quite happy to accept this figure and do nothing about it . #% I particularly hoped for visa facilitation to come before too long , as a practical demonstration of the freedom that Europe means for Bosnians , alongside the hard work it entails . #% We must make sure that candidate countries fulfil the requirements set out by the Commission in its latest annual report . #% Madam President , Burma is a mess and it is now becoming a nasty mess . #% Mr President , I am going to speak on the satellite agencies . #% Those days have now gone . #% It is important , therefore , that all legislation relating to this question should be as clear and accessible as possible . #% For example there are landmine clearance NGOs and ` Article 19 ' - which the Commissioner will be aware of in the UK - who have had problems with lost documents , and with a whole litany of complete chaos . #% That is what it was originally designed to do and we now have the ability to use it and to think about how we are going to develop the telecommunications capability , the ways of using it , the structure that we talked about in our early debate on telecommunications , the idea of virtual centres of excellence . #% After the phrase ` facilitating the access of unemployed young people to their first job ' , we would like to add ` and also the employment/continuance in employment of older people ' . #% We will be supporting Amendments Nos 31 and 38 to allow that back . #% One half of it , the Conservative Party , pretends to be Eurosceptic , whatever that means , while the other half , the Liberal Democratic Party , is unreservedly Europhile . #% Very briefly I should just say to the honourable Member that Valencia does have certain particular problems . #% I would say these are actually two quite shocking statements and , oddly enough , I would also say they back up exactly some of the things that Marta Andreassen , the Commission 's former chief accountant , had been saying . #% There are two further points from that text which I would like to emphasise . #% However , more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so . #% I therefore particularly want to speak in support of Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 8 , 13 and 18 , which have that effect . #% It is with this in mind that in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we have adopted three amendments at second reading , designed to strengthen still further the common position . #% I would to commend to future presidencies the meeting that Mr Henderson held with the bureaux of the joint parliamentary committees as a way forward . #% in writing . - I will vote for this report but I must make the point that certain organisations supported by the Commission , given the responsibility of delivering projects under EU-ACP partnerships , have been mired in corruption and have orchestrated a campaign of discrimination and victimisation against the members of staff who brought the said corruption to light . #% It was not quite as complicated on this occasion . #% Nine years later , more than 600 prisoners of war are unreleased and unaccounted for by Iraq . #% We must get the message across : the European Union is there to negotiate . #% One of the over-riding imperatives of Europe 's economy must be to compete in the global market , and this change is a necessary precondition to that end . #% In brief , what I am saying is this : listen to people ; listen to those who know what they are talking about ; be clear about your objectives ; and then explain yourselves in clear and simple language . #% Disable people should be fully consulted in the development of all proposals affecting them . #% I particularly want to ask about the rights of disabled users and to put a specific question to the Commission on the compromise presidency text . #% A ship with a black box is a safe ship . #% All I could hear was someone shouting down in the courtyard . #% They are still not all that considerable , but we know where the boundaries are . #% I must emphasise that I do not defend managements that behave irresponsibly or take state aids and then do not deliver the jobs . #% The biggest project that is coming forward to all of you is the completion of the internal market for services , and the barriers to companies setting up across the European Union are amply demonstrated by the work the Commission has done . #% Above all , we must change attitudes and encourage people to look at the world in a different way . #% I therefore welcome this report , which urges a further strengthening of provisions to enforce such equality . #% Therefore we continue to urge the Commission President to keep up the pace on reform , and we urge the governments to take heed of the reasons for the failure of the Lisbon Agenda in the first five years . #% What we have tried to ensure is that the agencies come forward with a staffing organigramme . #% Madam President , I am afraid I have to take issue with our rapporteur when he appears to believe that it is more important to have white meat than to raise animals in the most humane way possible . #% Member States : we will be watching you ! #% Meanwhile we will have given a green light to barbarism in any one of a hundred trouble spots currently around the world . #% Mr President , as my Group 's coordinator on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I would like to congratulate the Luxembourg presidency for the outstanding work it has done , not just on moving to close a number of crucial files such as unfair commercial practices , but also in its very strong engagement with the work of our Committee and its very strong commitment to the internal market . #% I think it gives an extraordinarily poor impression of this Parliament . #% It should no longer tolerate excuses for evasion of its sanctions and those sanctions must be toughened and extended . #% Hopefully that fear has been allayed . #% I did refer yesterday to the man or woman dressed as a cigarette packet standing outside this Chamber . #% To give you an example : I represent London and it could mean a problem for Caribbean people getting together to reminisce about life in the Caribbean in the 1950s if some white people were excluded . #% The Turkish authorities in particular have worked hard to obtain a just settlement that offers the prospect of peace and security . #% That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has also proposed a tighter definition of what a self-employed driver actually is in Amendment No 10 . #% The proposed directive sets limits on concentration in surface water of a number of substances including some pesticides , heavy metals and other dangerous chemicals and substances already mentioned by the rapporteur . #% Now that the LTTE have been defeated in the field , the Government and people of Sri Lanka need our sympathetic understanding and , above all , our assistance as they try to set their country once more on the path of recovery and prosperity and prevent any resurgence of terrorism . #% The ELDR has always strongly supported Chinese accession to the WTO but not at the cost of legitimate European interests , which do not always converge with American commercial interests . #% in writing . - As a friend , albeit critical friend , of Bulgaria , I wish to do all I can to assist progress in that country , but not at the expense of my own country 's well-being . #% You appear to have a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation states ; perhaps that is because you come from Belgium , which , of course , is pretty much a non-country . #% Mr President , I would like to address an issue that is of direct concern to my constituents . #% Australia is not a party to Kyoto and is clearly not planning to become one . #% It said that there was no identifiable risk that could lead to a justified ban , that they were safe if they were used according to existing rules . #% Finally , it was remiss of me . #% We will have the bland leading the bland , but I am not celebrating because they will press on with political union and , whilst our leaders may have saved face for the moment for themselves on the international stage , they have all betrayed their national democracies . #% It is much better to have a phased approach to improving standards . #% I call on the Bosnian Prime Minister , Adnan Terzic , to press for their release and for the EU to encourage and support him . #% I can only ask honourable Members to wait until the physical evidence is available . #% Real wages are stagnant . #% Rather than trying to kick the habit , they want to offer pills to the Eastern European countries waiting outside the school gates to get them hooked too . #% 
However , just as with business , in order for this to function efficiently there must be regulations . #% We have to decide , in a new era where physical location has become almost meaningless , where a dispute is eventually litigated , where a dispute is eventually solved . #% I congratulate most warmly my fellow rapporteur , and now the rapporteur , on his final report and on his previous work . #% In view of the shortage of time I am tempted just to say ` yes ' , but I think the honourable Member would like more detail than that . #% She and I worked very hard after the Commission proposed to legislate against sun in the second reading . #% Many honourable Members are familiar with the details and I thank them for their very close interest . #% Let me explain to you that these countries are broke . #% Arbitration has obviously been a failure , but the Commission must try to ensure that the trade can continue until such time as you , in conjunction with the Development and Trade Commissioners , can find a viable way of ensuring that other sources of income can be found for poor farmers in the Windward Islands so that they continue to have a future . #% If we get an agreement in the trialogue tomorrow , we can all celebrate . #% There should be no reason for setting artificial barriers to people 's progress through an organisation . #% How many of the EU 's reluctant citizens know that Europol officers have immunity from prosecution for anything that they do or say in the course of their duties ? #% There are 100 million people working in the EU in the private sector and , of these , 32 million people work in micro-businesses , which is businesses of less than 10 people ; 33 million people work in small to medium enterprises , with less than 249 people . #% Mr Patten has just made reference to this . #% Both of those are of great interest and show clearly that many of the points raised in debate previously have been taken on board . #% The Labour Government is determined to make the Single Market work for British business . #% The Commissioner , when he was here in this Chamber , and I have had many debates with him , was fond of quoting from Shakespeare and other English poets . #% He did not actually answer the question . #% The second - and a view to which I subscribe - is that we are actually allowing the power of cultural activities to cut across people ' s differences and to change people ' s lives . #% The European Commission never wastes a good crisis . #% An effort to develop nuclear energy is symptomatic of that crisis . #% I believe , despite the Commissioner 's assurance , that it was a mistake for the European Union to have agreed to the winding-up of the WTO panel which was established to deal with the objections to the Helms-Burton Act in return for the agreement of 18 May between the European Union and the USA , as it appears to accept an element of the extraterritorial validity of US law . #% Therefore , again , the European Union has a role to play in pushing this forward in a positive way . #% Despite that , in Britain there have been lurid headlines about 320 000 possible deaths and bodies being disposed of in mass graves . #% We should protect the hunter 's right to hunt but we should not guarantee him an unprotected route into retail outlets . #% When the Commissioner reflects on her term in office , she can take particular pride in the role she personally , and her team , played in securing support for the Kyoto Protocol . #% If only we could start to get more aid into that country we might do more to end the civil war there and actually get greater respect for human rights across the whole of that country . #% Nonetheless , they have been important in developing the conversion of defence industries , which is a key factor we have to play . #% The rapporteur has set this all to one side , effectively saying it is irrelevant , claiming that the original directive just did not go far enough . #% It is a fact , of course , that of the 134 members of the WTO , two-thirds are developing countries , with another 32 in a queue waiting to join . #% Such a convention would merely serve to waste time and taxpayers ' money . #% It goes without saying that there needs to be maximum transparency and probity in the allocation of guarantees , to ensure money is spent fairly , effectively and is in no way abused . #% Those are exactly the same principles as apply in the case of satellite broadcasting , which is essentially similar . #% On the night of 13 and 14 June 1941 , 34 260 people were deported from Lithuania , 15 081 from Latvia and 10 205 from Estonia . #% Credit is therefore due to all those who have worked so hard to bring this proposal before us today . #% I may add one other point , and that is that the development of biomass produces a reasonable alternative form of non-food production in the countryside . #% Finally , development . #% The Commission has told us that it accepts with good grace the requirement to supply an assessment of applications within three months . #% In a particularly lurid and ill-informed chapter on the Pentecostal movement , reference was made to the Christian fellowship active within this Parliament in Brussels . #% To my mind the key word is ` reform ' . #% This would help to avoid shipments of POPs in waste from countries that could and should deal with the waste themselves . #% I come from a parliamentary tradition where an elected House of Commons obtained its strength by having the vote on the budget . #% I am very pleased that there seems to be a concern right across the different political groups of this House . #% I also thank the Commissioner and his services for what is an outstanding programme -- the eSafety programme . #% I would like to know now from Mr Byrne how he proposes to validate Community decisions based on scientific advice - as the lifting of the beef ban was - when they are flouted by a Member State . #% It tells him and the other Commissioners that they can accept any amount of hospitality , from anyone , without there being any question of being held to account . #% It is extremely important that the Parliament dealt with this dossier in a mature , reasonable and practicable way . #% We are prepared to back Parliament 's rapporteur and look to the other side of this House to do the same . #% If we can resolve the short-term problems we must increase our efforts to resolve the long-term problems . #% However , Mr Dover and so were also involved . #% We hope that will be taken up . #% I strongly support the new cooperation agreement but this should be conditional on a substantial improvement in human rights . #% We acknowledge that meeting the Millennium Development Goals , which is part of the purpose of this debate , is difficult , but if we can put the money in place -- predictable money -- then we will get every child into school and we will prevent the needless deaths of 30 000 children every day . #% It is only parties that fail to respect our fundamental values that would be in trouble . #% Whilst I condemn the suppression of individual freedoms and rights in China , the Chinese know a few things about running a successful economy . #% It is by its very nature a controversial issue and public opinion could be unduly influenced one way or the other if it were felt that pressure were being exerted from non Member State sources . #% But I am afraid there are none so blind as those that can not see ! #% The way to deal with this and to make the internal market fairer and more of a level playing field is to do away with this tax altogether , but to do it gradually . #% We have been waiting for years for rules on data protection in the third pillar , which we were promised at the end of this year . #% We also need to recognize the need to fight poverty and not merely give unrestricted approval to a neo-liberal model . #% One of the problems we have always had in the common agricultural policy is that the funding has gone to multinationals such as supermarkets and not actually got down to the farmers . #% In France that has manifested itself in a changing government , where the emphasis now will shift to jobs , prosperity and employment and away from the type of budget-cutting that we have seen in the past . #% Market imbalance is not going to come from LDC imports . #% I hesitate to call it the Windows because that produces rather unfortunate competitive issues these days but those of you who are software experts will know what I mean when I use the word `` Linux '' . #% In the UK in particular , British banks have not been particularly sympathetic to small - and medium-sized companies . #% Given a task to do , Mr Blokland has produced a new and revised report that has certainly exceeded anything that we have done before . #% I reject this directive completely . #% 
I know that Commissioner Liikanen is interested in seeing this process streamlined , not only in the fine technical detail , but also by looking at the ways in which the industry itself can be encouraged to develop its own technical regulations within an overall public policy framework and indeed , on crucial issues like safety , to be able to move beyond those and to use its own technical resources to help make better , safer and more environmentally-friendly vehicles for us to use . #% I shall not thank any more people because I will run out of time , given that I have only got one minute . #% As regards public health , an area of competence that was enlarged during the Amsterdam Treaty and is currently undergoing reform , we would hope that the outcome of that reform will be an enlarged programme on public health issues and that the Commission will accept that and find the necessary funding - which inevitably will mean more than they are spending now . #% As for aerial spraying , what is proposed is no less than the use of biological weapons . #% He wants a referendum every five minutes . #% This is a matter of some urgency and I am very grateful to colleagues in this Parliament for agreeing to have today 's debate and for supporting this resolution . #% Research in the UK has indicated that 2.5 million people work longer than the maximum hours stated in the directive , but two thirds of them get paid for the extra hours so would lose out if the opt-out were removed . #% Support in the UK for his party has collapsed recently - a party of course desperate for EU institutions to govern the UK . #% How often have those words been uttered down the centuries ? #% You might ask who is responsible for this . #% Tomorrow we shall vote against the appointment of your Commission . #% In committee , many centre-right and right-wing Members voted against my report in whole or in part . #% Mr Hughes mentioned the importance of business impact assessments and that they should be carried out thoroughly . #% There are two key areas : the first is equal enforcement right through the supply chain to the market . #% They should be imposing smart sanctions that hurt those people in power . #% We are implementing large parts of it with no legal basis . #% The legal advice we have received from the Parliament 's Legal Service is that we can most certainly proceed with the report on Thursday . #% The stakes could not be higher . #% Furthermore , what other resources will be needed to help the Maltese in the long term to treat people with the dignity they deserve ? #% Could we please press other donors to focus on those areas ? #% There is no functional necessity for these posts , rather the reverse . #% Accordingly , the open coordination method must be used as a transition period towards a second stage where asylum is a full legislative agenda item . #% No more no less . #% It took the Eritreans decades and the deaths of tens of thousands of freedom fighters to achieve independence . #% We ought to prepare ourselves therefore to consult national parliaments about their approach to the treaty before we set out detailed prescriptions just on our own , within our own procedures . #% Then , to adopt any significant legislation , the approval of the Council is needed , amongst other things . #% This is because technological change comes with something else : it comes with a huge transformation in the values and norms of our society and a huge transformation of our global economy . #% The answer simply must be ` No ' ! #% You have been warned ! #% So , leaving aside any negative attitudes to enlargement in general that have begun to develop in some countries , what are the substantive obstacles to be overcome by Bulgaria in the next few months ? #% We are talking about travel through US air space . #% I need to stress the importance of resolving the issue of working time in excluded sectors like road transport . #% The European Commission and Council should heed our clear intentions in this respect . #% Firstly , this programme must strike a proper balance . #% It also means boosting the EU 's research and development effort and ensuring lifelong learning . #% Firstly , in terms of agriculture : we do not believe in having a reserve - we already have some money which has already been made available and a letter of amendment on its way , and I feel that it is quite sufficient . #% We need a strategy on how to handle the demands which we will face in the months and years ahead . #% But may I also express my appreciation to the Commissioner and her colleagues who turned this claim around in seven months . #% We need improved competitiveness to maintain our European social model , but that model is a productive factor in itself for achieving competitiveness . #% A brief question to the Commission : will the Commission honour the commitment made several years ago to provide the necessary financial support to the Lesotho Government , so as to enable it to pursue these court cases to their conclusion and thereby guarantee good governance ? #% The president was forced to flee , accused of corruption and stealing the election . #% Consequently , we support actually capping the EU budget contributions by Member States to 1 % Gross National Income . #% The reason why it was lost was because originally it was blocked for reasons I will not bother to go into now . #% Are there things that the Commission , as guardian of the treaties , can think of that could still be done not only to try and make sure that Member States respect their obligations in the future , but how we can still get investigations - including , I very much hope , a proper public inquiry now under the new UK Government - to make sure that we know fully what happened in the past and what went wrong ? #% The matter was raised by the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions at a meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs some time last autumn . #% As I see no justification for European Parliament offices in other countries , I certainly oppose the costly proposal , in paragraph 40 , of a permanent European Parliament official post in Washington DC . #% Now we have an initial road-map ; a reference point for European businesses trading on the Web ; a road-map that has clearly established the country of origin principle while still protecting consumer interest . #% I therefore ask the Commission to make even greater efforts to inform the citizens of Europe . #% Secondly , speaking on behalf of my Group about Mr Ettl 's report , I would like to congratulate him on the work he has done . #% As a school report might say , all in all , so far so good . #% Unfortunately , Labour 's approach to this question is likely to lead to more unemployment , not less . #% in writing . - I take issue with amendment 2 , which criticized the Roman Catholic Church and its leader Pope Benedict for his views on the use of condoms , but wisely the House rejected this amendment . #% The subject of the report this evening by our colleague , Mr Garosci , which is an excellent report , is a matter of profound importance because commerce , retail and wholesale distribution and retail services to the public in general are great creators of jobs , as has been pointed out by a number of other speakers in the debate so far . #% He has earned our praise for the successful establishment of the ECB and the smooth introduction of the euro . #% Human rights organisations and the UN Secretary-General 's Special Representative on Human Rights defenders have expressed regret at the EU position on Colombia taken at the recent donors ' meeting at Cartagena . #% The traditional push towards harmonisation has been the internal market to which we can now add the aspirations of Tampere for a single area of European justice . #% In the immediate aftermath , telephone lines were severed , and some mobile phone services have not resumed . #% We are aware that the gap between rich and poor has become a chasm , that the people of Russia are losing faith in the ideal of democracy and that the infrastructure is crumbling and workers are not paid . #% In my contribution I should like to refer to paragraph 26 of the report , which states explicitly to the Commission , on behalf of this Parliament , that we are not satisfied that development aid is sufficiently focused on poverty eradication and that we need to build on the agreed benchmark system . #% Current signals from Geneva have not been positive , and the Commissioner admitted not so long ago that the negotiations were in dire straits . #% When it agreed to open negotiations with Croatia , I confess I suspected that a rather grubby deal had been done to overcome Austria 's objections to Turkey . #% Like every major incinerator proposal it sends up in smoke not just the waste but the prospect of small recycling centres and the jobs with which they are associated . #% We do want the Commission to carry out its external assistance with greater efficiency and we welcome measures to that effect . #% When President Prodi launched the new fast-track method of negotiation , it radically changed the enlargement negotiations . #% I should be grateful if the statement could be followed by a short debate as provided for under Rule 37 . #% Regarding Mr Grosch 's report , I welcome the directive because it recognises that we now have an opportunity to improve road safety . #% 
So you see the strong Finnish theme in this report continues even with me . #% I will certainly pass it on to a group of charity workers in my constituency who are trying to organize a trip to the European Union . #% This is now an outdated view which has been bypassed by recent events . #% author . - Madam President , what more can we say about Burma that has not already been said , including calling again for the release of political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi who has become a global icon in the struggle for freedom ? #% One issue I wish to take up on the Dublin question is one which is not shown on the Dublin budget accounts : the amount of money that has not been accrued due to exchange rate losses . #% If we receive Parliament 's opinion late , then that , obviously , would put pressure on the time available for the proper consideration of Parliament 's opinion . #% Surely if it is good enough for us and our institutions , it should be good enough for cabin crew members . #% Combining roads with other modes of transport is essential . #% The Environment Committee has taken the logical step that the Commission avoided . #% Financial compensation for rehabilitation is important , but we should remember that you can never buy back innocence . #% Likewise , we - the EU - have been rebuffed for observer status . #% Today is not the time when we say farewell , but it is a moment to appreciate the work that Jacob Söderman has carried out and his efforts on our behalf and very much in the interests of Europe . #% Parliament particularly welcomes the inclusion of a new point in the proposed directive to prohibit all activities exposing workers to asbestos fibres , except demolition work and disposal of waste products resulting from demolition and removal work . #% There will be complaint from the Bosnians that the Serbs did not allow absentee voting etc. , but as their candidate will probably be the first president , these complaints might not be as vocal in the future . #% In view of change , and since much of the money was going into the refugee camps over that period of time , I would like to ask the Commissioner how he sees development in the future and where the financial aid is going to be directed ? #% Nonetheless , we have a text which improves on and consolidates the status quo and delivers to the citizen , within the time frame set in the Amsterdam Treaty , a comprehensive and practical framework for access to the institutions ' documents . #% Are you going to put both propositions to the vote ? #% If your colleagues in DG Environment continue to press the industry to make smaller , lighter cars without any commercial regard for what is going on , then we will be back here again . #% It is not yet obviously affecting humankind . #% Lisbon set far-reaching goals for the next decade - to create the world 's leading knowledge-based economy by 2010 , to create 20 million new jobs across Europe by 2010 and to promote economic and social reform which combine competitiveness and social cohesion , investing in people and raising skill levels . #% For us to deplore human rights abuses in Burma and say that we wish to coordinate actions internationally to make the Burmese regime change its policies and then to eschew the opportunity of using trading opportunities through the WTO in order to coordinate those actions is contradictory . #% On the second issue -- that of prisoners ' rights -- let us remind everyone that the rule of law demands respect for the law on the rights of prisoners . #% A realistic timetable for implementation is five years , any attempt to compress that time will result in spiralling costs . #% We must not let Milosevic win . #% It is already in place for beef , for fish , and for fresh fruit and vegetables . #% That is unacceptable in a partner with whom any state , any government is expected to negotiate . #% To encourage it to do so , the UK Conservative delegation will vote against this report . #% We actually reinforce the argument from eurosceptics and the europhobes that this House means nothing and achieves nothing . #% Finally , Commissioner Patten himself told us in Parliament when he brought forward the 12-month extension that it would not be late again ; he listened to our views and yet the situation has arisen again . #% Mr Brok is right : this is a joint motion from the two committees . #% Thousands of investors have lost money because of the cost of over-bonusing ` with-profit ' life assurance policies . #% This Parliament should also be concerned that there is no consensus either within Parliament or with society outside . #% We encourage the regulators to share best practice with each other to provide a unified price and contract comparison system . #% Sadly , Mr President , even though Mrs De Palacio answered our questions on transport to our satisfaction , and as a group we will no doubt endorse the Commission tomorrow , we must enter a reservation on the candidature of Mrs De Palacio pending the findings of the OLAF and the Spanish authorities ' investigations and because of the way she responded to questioning on this issue at her hearing . #% A badly thought-through expansion of biofuels could result in virgin forests being destroyed and habitats lost . #% I would like to emphasise , as Mr Blokland did - and it came through in our report - that there is a moral dimension to this . #% We need to look at a new role for the countryside . #% Most of these amendments were put down either by members of the technical group of racists or by the EPP on positions that they lost in committee . #% How does the European Union react to this ? #% Speaking on behalf of my group , I find very little ground for difference now after the discussions we had in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection on this issue . #% I am quite sure that the careers services across Europe do not have enough resources to alert students to the opportunities in the single market of Europe . #% But if this Assembly is to begin to behave as a proper review body with any teeth it must begin to ask some fundamental questions about the whole principle behind these agreements . #% Many women that I have met across the United Kingdom working in elderly care centres , etc. , are doing so because they want to earn money in order to send money back to care for their children in the countries where they come from . #% As regards nonylphenol ethoxylate , again we have made substantial progress - progress that I regret can not result in an immediate implementation of complete controls on it . #% But what of the implications for the rest of us ? #% For the time being no ban has been implemented by the Member States in general . #% This is the worst ecological disaster for years and the PPE-DE Group calls for a hearing - pathetic ! #% There have been a number of problems regarding amendments such as the order of the amendments and how they have been grouped together . #% They and their customers are either going out of business completely or are being forced to rely on the corporate feed producers whom they would normally wish to avoid . #% This is right for Europe as a leader and innovator in the field , and it is right for the 3 million people dying of AIDS worldwide to make sure that the money works . #% But we must not forget that this is all part of the total development of the internal market . #% Indeed , I was one of the authors of an amendment in the last Parliament to increase the funding to help the children who are still suffering the consequences of the radioactivity to date . #% We are already India 's biggest trading partner , at some EUR 40 billion annually , and we collaborate now on high-tech projects such as Galileo and ITER , demonstrating the sophistication of India 's 8 % annual growth economy . #% It is likely that the democracies will have to maintain a commitment for many years to come . #% So far that progress has been good , if a little slow . #% At the same time , unemployment will still be rising ; growth will be too weak to bring unemployment down . #% I am particularly struck if you look at Europe in terms of its river systems rather than its political structures . #% We all want to see cleaner vehicles on our roads . #% Will we speak with one voice when we go to events in the future since we now have our single currency about to be born ? #% The terms of imprisonment are burdensome . #% In fact , we adopted our opinion , which echoes what Mr Agnoletto was saying , by 20 votes to 1 . #% I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view . #% Often in this House we have been able to put particular funds on reserve at first reading , but perhaps the conditions for release or the way in which this has been approached have not been sensible or coherent . #% This is a right which does not incur financial consequences . #% Finally , we must consider whether or not we need to increase defence expenditure if we are to meet our ambitions for the CFSP . #% They are to receive huge handouts , which they call ` Community subsidies for organisations working to advance the idea of Europe ' . #% 
Not only were they extended to apply to the self-employed , they had added into them penalties , imprisonment , fines and other condemnations which would have made life difficult for these people . #% Surely it is logical for the European Council to invite formal nominations and to hear candidates , perhaps including Mr Verhofstadt , ahead of the decision . #% There are those , including LTTE apologists , who want to deliver a further blow to the Sri Lankan people by undermining the GSP + preferential trade arrangements with the EU . #% That is daft and I hope if there is any threat of that there will be a swift telephone call from the Vatican to say that St Peter 's Basilica will not stand for such nonsense . #% It is also possible that a manufacturer could move a model up to a class containing larger vehicles simply by adding 15 cm of plastic to the front . #% Therefore we must drop not just two , but all four of those issues . #% We will wait to hear Mr Vitorino , but it is rumoured that the Commission will accept amendments to take these beneficiaries out . #% He certainly achieves cohesion in one respect , because ordinary people in all parts of the continent will be equally confused by his report , and he is equally out of touch with all of them . #% The Commission has to deliver on the areas for which it is responsible , particularly the completion of the internal market . #% I hope now that Commissioner Monti will read the specific questions , will read the inadequacy of his reply as answers to those questions , interesting as it may have been in other regards , and will then answer the questions . #% They have not only shaken off the shackles of Communism but also embraced the free market , low taxation and minimal regulation . #% Mr President , thank you and congratulations to Mr Deva for a very wide-ranging and comprehensive report . #% So I am delighted that these paragraphs have been adopted . #% Madam President , I would like to put on record my disappointment that we will not be able this week to discuss the money-laundering directive . #% I ask Parliament and the Commission to do all they possibly can to secure his release . #% We must address wider issues . #% I continue to support Amendment No 18 , which is designed to reduce the burden on the industry by ensuring that the obligation to provide information applies only when a customer requests it . #% The sharing of statistics and everything else it involves must not be seen as a substitute for moving towards the full communitarisation of a common asylum policy with full involvement for Parliament . #% It is impossible to have good management under the imperfectly centralised regime of the present CFP . #% Could you , Commissioner , therefore propose a directive , budget or whatever is necessary to set up a central information point where the names and telephone numbers of the people responsible in the 25 countries can be reached quickly before criminals escape ? #% In the past seven years the taxpayers of the European Union have paid out EUR 1.4 billion to the governments and elsewhere and , even in the neutral words of the Commission , it is difficult to trace where the money goes . #% Mr President , I also welcome the Commissioner 's statement at the beginning that he wants at least to remain at the 5 % level of finning for the present . #% We as a Parliament want to see rights of children included within the Intergovernmental Conference and as part of the European Treaty . #% If Europe wishes to play a central role in the World Conference Against Racism it has to start seeing itself as others see it rather than as we would like to be . #% She also accused me of not listening to her speech , so I want to make a point of refuting her argument , because she seemed to make the point that we have moved on in one year and a half . #% Late payment often suffocates many credible businesses , particularly small and medium-sized companies . #% One member of my cabinet has specialist responsibility for reform of personnel policy , including whistle-blowing , and others are naturally actively involved in the overall issue . #% We have asked the Commission on more than one occasion to supply information on the practical effects of their proposals , they have not so done . #% Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world . #% But while Cargill is so delighted that its profits will rise while Chinese self-sufficiency in agricultural goods falls , the picture is a good deal less optimistic for the people of China themselves . #% We decided to abstain on Amendment 2 as we believe that military doctrine is a matter for national governments to decide and not in the prerogative of the European Parliament . #% There is also a very practical reason why this should happen . #% The CAP discriminates against farmers in developing nations and penalises our own consumers . #% Mr President , I had the privilege of being a member of the Council of Ministers ' Consultative Committee on Racism and Xenophobia , along with Professor Pelinka . #% I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report , but I can not agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all . #% I believe another one is about to start . #% We therefore know the potential of such courts to help war-torn regions by ending a climate of impunity and moving on . #% I am not complaining because what they said contained some fascinating , important and valuable information . #% With the money I had on me I calculated that I could buy ten Kalashnikovs or three rocket launchers . #% We can not specify requirements that lie beyond our ability to operate in a meaningful way reflecting the best practical means available at the time . #% This gives some comfort to operators and provides a more balanced situation . #% Mr President , the history of ferry safety can only be described as scandal : despite the tragic events in the 1950s , 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , next to nothing was done . #% Of course we condemn torture - it is inexcusable wherever it takes place - but we should also recognise the political exploitation of torture allegations by opponents of the Turkish regime . #% I sympathise with Amendments Nos 11 and 12 by the Green Group , but I can not support them . #% I am pleased that this report contains a sensible and workable approach to vaccination in the future . #% His twenty-eight-year-old son has only been to Italy once when his plane was diverted to Milan airport because of bad weather . #% It is not recklessness it is ruthlessness . #% Bucharest must act on the report 's recommendations if Romania is to succeed in membership of the European Union . #% In 1999 , we had further evidence of particular problems in Spain , Italy and Greece . #% So Member States signing up will have to answer questions like that of one my constituents , Serwa Nouri Yousef , who has refugee status , who is now eight months pregnant and whose husband has been forcibly returned to Iraq and is now missing . #% We think that is an important step in the right direction . #% The people of Zimbabwe are victims of a human rights catastrophe . #% Secondly , such money as is collected will invariably go to the wrong people . #% To pursue other options , such as the regatta formula of starting negotiations with all the applicant states , bar Slovakia , would merely slow down the whole process and encourage unrealistic expectations . #% We welcome the genuine dialogue that we have with the Kazakh Government , parliament , the opposition and the wider community . #% Replacing highly skilled , trained staff with ships ' crew able to load and unload is a recipe for accidents , injury and , possibly , deaths . #% Apart from death and taxes , birth is the only certainty in life . #% It is saying to large-scale organisers : ` You can carry on exploiting the fans ' . #% The thrust behind our question - which is tabled at a timely point in the run-up to the Barcelona Summit - is that the need across the European Union to deliver access to information society services and to encourage the climate in which new services will develop has to be at the foundation of the Lisbon goal to deliver the most competitive knowledge-driven economy in the world . #% Mr President , the previous port services directive was rejected by the last Parliament in the 2003 plenary and , as nothing has changed , why should the Commission expect a different answer this time ? #% The rapporteur lists many sectors where improvements can be made : by public authorities , industry , business and individual consumers . #% We will have the final say on what happens and rest assured it will not be a trade-off as to whether we keep that in or take it out to create the same amount of money in category 2 . #% I would add , to underline that , that the polling stations for the referendum had been opened for at least two weeks before 24 November , which was when the voting took place . #% We have to bring the Turkish Cypriots in from the cold . #% The processes of original design are prototyping , testing and making . #% The Council will be considering other matters too , including the international situation . #% 
Thirdly , in relation to this there is the specific case concerning the Chief Accountant , where we have put a small amount of Commission travel expenses in reserve . #% In addition , we can not support the creation of this new agency as we are opposed to creating new agencies when the case for them has not been made . #% Why should they care about the details of qualified majority voting if they have lost their jobs ? #% As the last staff committee elections were inquorate , we presumably do not have a staff committee and I think the Bureau needs to examine why there are members of staff on sabbatical leave when there is no quorate staff committee . #% Secondly , Mr Lamfalussy has promised that he and his successor are prepared to issue half-yearly reports on the EMI 's preparatory work for EMU . #% All the agricultural improvement programmes ever invented will be useless if the desertification of the Sahel continues . #% I also think that with the age-old problem of stocks in general there is always a conflict between the scientific advice and what the fishermen believe the stocks to be . #% Indeed , research at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi recently calculated the euro ' s value as if it had existed over the last few decades , weighting each predecessor currency 's value to create a synthetic euro . #% Local adoptions have doubled in the last few months and 20 000 children are leaving special schools this week and will be going back into normal schools and normal life . #% Firstly , I have discussed this with Mr. Liikanen and , if we have time to reach it this afternoon , he is certainly prepared to address the subject , if not necessarily the full scope of the question . #% Could this be rectified ? #% There is to be no rewriting of Nice - that has been refused . #% Many speakers have spoken about the problem of a moratorium . #% I wanted to get rid of the word ` eventually ' . #% The amendments that I have just listed are also aimed at ensuring that further single measures of this kind should in future be unnecessary and , therefore , precluded . #% Mr President , I am pleased to follow the honourable gentleman , Mr Mote . #% For these reasons it would make more economic sense to support the affected regions by a comprehensive programme for alternative crops or other activities that could be financed through the Rural Development Programme . #% It is the same with the environment . #% The post of Ombudsman is a crucial post for European democracy . #% In the original working time directive we had agreed way back in 1993 that it would be possible to introduce annualisation of working time for categories of workers , but only where collective agreements allowed that to happen . #% This will be a useful part of the reform process and I thank you very much for your support . #% A few days ago , on 10 December , the former financial secretary , now acting Chief Executive , Donald Tsang , said in a speech in Hong Kong : ` The free flow of information , the freedom to say and do what we want are the very fabric of Hong Kong society ' . #% This is not to assist xenophobic consumers who wish to reject all things foreign - although there is nothing wrong with the desire to support one 's own farmers who are facing unprecedented economic pressures . #% No , Parliament does not want the European Union to provide the minimum possible . #% It became clear that no lasting change could happen before the convention and the intergovernmental conference of 2004 had been concluded . #% Mr Koukiadis ' report directly concerns only the first of what are now three directives on working time . #% Is the impact study being done by the Commission to consider these positive advantages as well as possible costs ? #% It would have meant a huge amount of inconvenience for consumers . #% Secondly , the arrangements for managing the renovation of the Berlaymont were also delayed . #% Similarly the EPLP does not see the need to harmonize speed limits . #% That is something we need to try to exploit together in the most effective way possible . #% Enlargement would have been an opportunity to have started with a clean sheet , but it was missed with Agenda 2000 's so-called reforms ; and it will be missed again . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , may I start by thanking Mr Casini for his work in delivering this interinstitutional agreement . #% Madam President , like the last speaker , I too wonder why we are considering these proposals . #% Does he not believe that the excuse that the organising federation no longer exists is actually a facile one when clearly it is the responsibility of the French Football Federation ? #% As the Commissioner is well aware , in my own country , the United Kingdom , there has been a certain amount of entirely misleading controversy caused in the press about this proposal . #% His quote , ` I want to believe obstinately that neither the French or the Dutch have rejected the Constitutional Treaty ' , will go down in history as being typical of the attitude of the EU 's political elite in the 21st century . #% I also regret the lack of TV monitor screens in the bar and restaurant areas which should be available to members having a coffee break to follow the debates in progress and , if due to speak , to time their entries back into the chamber appropriately . #% If we achieve the appropriate votes tomorrow , that unwillingness becomes an obligation and the Council will have to sit down and negotiate with Parliament . #% We need reform in the sugar sector not only due to WTO pressures but also because we need a competitive EU food industry , to maintain jobs and a viable industry . #% I do not hold to the cosiness of the view that Russia is doing all that it should , or that it is deeply concerned . #% When we look at incineration , when we look at burial and look at the hazards , created by the 1 % of farms that have still been using swill for pigs , we see additional risks on each side . #% Whilst we are tonight seeking to adopt new tyre standards to reduce tyre noise we are not making any progress at all on tyre standards for the grip or adhesion of tyres on the road . #% But they can not be dealt with only through financial aid , though aid is clearly needed ; nor can they be dealt with by legislation , although legislation can of course help in appropriate cases . #% We abide by those same principles but in this instance , after what Parliament has fought for over the years , this revision of the interinstitutional agreement , a revision of the Financial Perspective as outlined in the interinstitutional agreement , is extremely important to Parliament . #% Is that still your opinion ? #% The eco-label should not be associated with mediocrity . #% I think it is very important that we look at the issues and see how far we have come in eighteen months . #% We have probably seen more democracies in West Africa than there have ever been . #% For me , tonight will hopefully be the major culmination of the process . #% Madam President , I am really sorry but there is an abuse going on . #% Politics is certainly an odd business . #% We would applaud the Commissioner 's efforts to try and secure agreement in the Council as soon as possible . #% However , the common position returned to this Parliament offers a number of low common denominators . #% It is very good that we negotiated this transitional period to 1 November 2006 . #% However , to do that it needs a commitment to sustainability in all aspects of its work , and that includes integration of social and environmental factors into its economic and trade policies . #% Within this House , we are looking at our own arrangements for access to documents and access to information . #% They will be able to take their car and its existing insurance cover for a period of up to 12 months , without any problems . #% I am sure Marco Polo will be even more popular in the United Kingdom . #% This follows on from a decade-long conflict , which has cost 11 000 lives . #% We learned this in the 1970s , when higher prices brought more oil fields into production yet did not reduce consumption in the transport sector . #% Time and time again in Holy Scripture we are warned against what is called genetic confusion . #% Mr President , I just wish to support most of what has been said in this debate this afternoon . #% I am proud that , in Geneva , we see that Europe is a champion of human rights and , with the work due to start in June this year , our resolution today says that we should be a champion of further reform of the Human Rights Council itself . #% I notice that the President of the Commission referred to reduction in working time , not adaptation of working time . #% The system envisaged for the staff of the European Union institutions largely replicates the system currently employed in the OECD . #% 
It is important to allow firms to innovate and to invest , and a certain amount of profit generation is necessary to allow that investment . #% This measure will give them some new hope of earlier treatment . #% On a more positive note , the committee 's decision to put back the Commission 's implementation dates was very much welcome . #% Too often by our actions we enhance the credibility and status of terrorists and thereby encourage terrorism . #% Despite concerns from some Members , I believe that we need to foster closer cooperation with these countries as this allows the EU to monitor catches of tuna and other fish that are canned on Papua New Guinea . #% The reality is that we have a process that is safe if used properly . #% The report recommends that Member States take measures to ensure that the most disadvantaged women , especially single parents , are guaranteed a minimum income . #% Just last week a Latsis company -- the Aegean Motorways Group -- was put on a shortlist of for the lucrative Athens to Thessaloniki motorway project . #% In conclusion , you may gather that I doubt the sincerity of this report , which includes the statement : ` recommends that Member States deepen cooperation and exchange of best practice ' . #% There is a lot of commercialisation and privatisation , particularly in transport , and a lot of the responsibility is in the hands of private and semi-public agencies . #% Sometimes , however , employers take advantage of our young workers and force them to work unnecessarily long hours . #% Does the Commission agree that such a strategy must have these three key objectives : to spur the revival of Doha ; to offer an ambitious alternative to restart the process of liberalisation on the widest possible basis if our primary goal fails ; and to counter the proliferation of preferential deals amongst small groups of countries ? #% We should not present that at the end of the Luxembourg summit meeting as the cure-all for our problems . #% There should be no delay in the fulfilment of Europe 's commitments to provide duty-free , quota-free access on a stable and long-term basis to LDCs . #% There are so many regulations , it is unbelievable . #% The EU is neither designed nor equipped to handle such matters from a military standpoint . #% The spirit and reality of the development round is surely called into question if developing countries have the clear perception - and they do now , as Mrs McNally said - that commercial interest is being put before public health . #% In Recital C we say what is the point in democracy and social clauses in our agreements when there appears to be little attempt to monitor and enforce such clauses ? #% We also urge the Commission to make an appropriate response to the Advisory Board 's recommendations to deliver value for money and to protect the interests of the EU taxpayer . #% Individual nations know precisely where help is needed within their own domains and yet the European Union is determined to exert its authority by controlling structural support for what it considers to be impoverished regions . #% Thank you , Commissioner for taking this question . #% That is right and proper . #% This proposal , along with those for monitoring the European Patent Office , sits more conveniently in the context of the Community Patent and how it may be properly administered , which is where this whole matter really belongs . #% There are also some enormous loopholes in the legislation . #% However , there are ways of tackling this crisis which do not risk damaging the local economy . #% I do so as the Labour Party spokesperson on Northern Ireland . #% What is in it ? #% The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better . #% Next , in terms of procedure , we should be a little careful that this Commission , although very active in looking forward to the next financial perspective , could bring us in theory to 2013 , which not only covers the next Commission but also the Commission after that . #% My vote in favour of this report reflects the need for a European standard of rights for bus and coach passengers that ensures their comfort , safety and fair treatment as they travel across Europe . #% The recent unsolved murder of editor-in-chief , Elmar Huseynov , has raised accusations of government involvement and a relative of the exiled former speaker and opposition figure , Rasul Gouliev , the UK citizen Almaz Gouliev , has been arrested on the allegedly trumped-up charge of a pistol being found in her bag , apparently in order to deter Mr Gouliev from returning for the elections . #% Let us see some action . #% I recognise that the step-by-step approach is a realistic one : first all non-domestic consumers then domestic later , as a progressive opening , is a more orderly process . #% Nor should it be . #% I would just like to underline that this is an issue that has the support of all parties in my own country . #% We are a little concerned about the proposals on Member States including chemicals in the PIC procedure and think that everyone should be properly consulted if that is going to happen . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - I agree entirely with that . #% You must resolve those issues inside the Commission before you take steps towards creating a food agency . #% This is a people that have already suffered war , ethnic cleansing , a brutal dictatorship , an illegal invasion and communal violence , and are now seeing borders closing both externally and internally , seeing little chance of resettlement , and seeing a very mixed reception should any of them make it to the European Union . #% We are talking about the procedure and timescale because we all know that as from the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May there will be major concerns about the inability of intellectual property owners to enforce their rights across the enlarged European Union . #% The outbreak farm was so severely infected that it was six months before it was safe to disinfect it . #% My proposed compromise on this point is the same as the Commission 's revised opinion following our first reading . #% And the mobile phone manufacturers of the world have agreed to cooperate to ensure the environmentally sound management of their end-of-life products . #% The full and proper integration of the Roma into mainstream society in Bulgaria requires changes on both sides . #% Research seems to show that our traditions are tending to converge slowly . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Mr Schulz is perfectly correct that this is a week of celebration , solemnly proclaiming the Charter protecting our citizens from abuse of the great power vested inside the Union , and the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon strengthening our capacity to act and improving dramatically the quality of our democracy . #% The targets which it has set itself will fail completely . #% That is why I tabled , and supported , Amendment No 3 that was put forward by the Committee on Culture , restricting our commitment to three years . #% Not for our own sake , necessarily , but certainly for the sake of many workers in developing countries , because the reality is that China 's deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world , pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers ' rights and conditions in their bid to remain competitive at all costs , and forcing ILO conventions on freedom of association and bargaining on China is certainly part of the solution . #% The effects of the restrictions are very damaging to free movement and employment : thousands of jobs are at risk . #% One of the particular concerns is the very high value of the 500-euro note , which is in danger of making the euro the currency of choice for counterfeiters and money launderers , because it is substantially higher in value than any other note in regular circulation in the United States , Japan or the United Kingdom . #% We must not lose sight of our aspiration , which is not simply about completing a political process of European enlargement but about bringing the people of Romania together with all those we represent . #% We have an exercise in subterfuge bogged down in a quagmire of procedure , I would hasten to suggest . #% That is obviously a lesson well-learnt and we applaud the attempts to keep the document which will be discussed in Doha as crisp and brief as possible . #% Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well ? #% Most importantly , it recognizes the differences in the new security situation : the fact that peacekeeping in conflict prevention is now so important . #% The sum of EUR 11.5 million may be a small amount in the grander scheme of things , but it is still a lot of money . #% As one speaker has said , we are all equal but some are more equal than others . #% Although South Africa ' s neighbours have been promised compensation for the cost to them of adjustments in South Africa , it is far from clear how this will work in practice . #% We want to have the increasing antibiotic resistance , which is being demonstrated at the moment in zoonotic organisms , accurately mapped . #% If he will do so we can deal with this report in two minutes . #% We have , of course , the unhappy fact of one death penalty upheld in Turkey at this very moment . #% We look forward in the future to seeing how the fruits of this work are going to bring immediate benefits - long-term benefits , employment benefits and business benefits - to the citizens of the European Union . #% But of course , having done that , it allows the producers of those parts , and particularly tuning and other companies , to have access to the single market with a single approval . #% I mean no disrespect to the rapporteur , and I hope he will forgive me for saying that I can not make the same comments about his own report . #% The mere identification of the third parties is often lengthy and time-consuming . #% 
Access to clean water is a basic human right , so let us make it a major campaign . #% We will return to those details on future occasions . #% Many things will change between now and December : inside the Union we will have reached an IGC settlement that will fully prepare us for further accessions ; in Turkey the AKP administration will have consolidated its legitimacy and a new reform package will have progressed through Parliament ; social and economic circumstances will have improved and advances will hopefully have been made in the practical implementation of reforms ; and Turkey will have continued improving its relations with its neighbours . #% Mr President , I must begin by explaining that I have no association at all with Edinburgh University , but I think that it is important to stress their bona fides . #% Of course , it is of concern if concessions are abused , but there must be measured and proportionate responses . #% But in each of the three programmes tonight we shall need to wrestle with the need to resource their contents properly and sustainably . #% She uses a wheelchair . #% We criticise them frequently for their cost , bureaucracy and secrecy . #% If these proposals go ahead , one can imagine all manner of projects and policies which could be foisted on the UK by the back door . #% That accountability should include scrutiny by elected representatives , independent regulation and the involvement of civil society and NGOs . #% Increasing our young people 's skills has always been one of our priorities and we must continue to support this aim . #% I am disappointed not to have received replies to my letters to the Greek and Italian Foreign Ministers on this subject . #% We have a saying , Commissioner , in the UK , if it is not broke , do n't mend it . #% It is precisely this sort of detailed , petty interference that drives the people served by Europe to distraction . #% Even a full application of the Geneva Convention does not meet all protection needs and that is why many Member States have additional categories . #% The same recommendation applies to the fight against corruption . #% UK Conservative MEPs will continue to resist any amendments to any report at any time which attempt to make similar encroachments into Member State competences . #% I shall be supporting Amendment No 12 . #% Mr President , the history of the package of terms and conditions of Members of this House is not a very glorious one and it does no particular credit to all those who have been involved with it , who seem somehow to be hexed by the subject matter . #% Animal welfare would be compromised as farmers would be reluctant to treat animals therapeutically . #% Secondly , we can not support proposals for the split in funding or criteria in relation to the new Structural Fund regulation . #% I know certain Member States feel that a far longer transition period will be necessary . #% I quite rightly asked DG I to look at the report as it was voted in committee to see if it was legally admissible in the way it set up and called for a committee of inquiry . #% Europe will not work without strong authorities in Brussels . #% I have previously asked about the alleged involvement of the European Union 's own intelligence resources in the management of slush funds in offshore accounts , and I still await a reply . #% Mr President , many of us today have voted for the trade agreement with Pakistan in the belief that this is a sensible and essential step forward to progress the issue of human rights and further democratisation of Pakistan . #% This report correctly contrasts the situation between the world 's largest secular democracy which has devolved structures at all levels - India , including Jammu and Kashmir - and Pakistan , which still lacks full implementation of democracy in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and has yet to take steps towards democracy in Gilgit and Baltistan . #% Parliament was not consulted , despite my earlier questions . #% Sensible arrangements have been made for seasonal agricultural equipment and special equipment such as the diesel engines used to launch lifeboats in the UK , all of which have limited hours of operation every year . #% First , on health impact assessments : in all the relevant literature it is clear there is still a lack of integration of health issues into transport policy at EU level . #% Are we trying to reduce CO2 emissions , or are we trying to reduce energy consumption ? #% Mr President , I am delighted to see that Commissioner Byrne is here this morning because , as Chairman of the European Parliament 's Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals , I was very disappointed to receive a letter from Commissioner Byrne saying he was unable to come and meet our intergroup in the next three , four , five or six months to discuss issues concerning animal welfare , in particular the live transport of animals . #% I am still having problems being able to get into the part-session and being able to get in and out of committee meetings , both here and in Brussels . #% We can not expect to have dynamic economies if we make even greater demands on those who are generating growth and jobs by imposing heavy tax regimes and bureaucratic regulations . #% It will go on its way with our qualified support . #% Pragmatism has its virtues , but we need to know the hard political choices that you will make when the chips are down and the principles that you will not compromise on . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Colom i Naval for his excellent report which several other committees have contributed to . #% If the Parliament wants to be taken seriously , we must stop grandstanding and instead start delivering for the citizens of our Member States . #% Rape and sexual violence by members of the occupying armed forces are still widespread . #% The Israeli Prime Minister says that the lives of Israelis are more important than those of Palestinians . #% The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the resolution on the situation in Lebanon , in particular its focus on the importance of free , democratic and transparent parliamentary elections , the need for a complete and rapid withdrawal of Syrian forces and intelligence , and hopes for reform to spread across the wider Middle East . #% However , what were Mozart 's political views , if any ? #% Lastly , of a political nature , there are a number of networks and non-governmental organisations now which are indeed in favour of world trade and would like to take a responsible part in these negotiations . #% Unemployment in the UK has increased by over a quarter of a million in the last year . #% We have waited many years for this . #% We were against this TDIP committee from the beginning and feel that it is a waste of money which duplicates Senator Marty 's efforts in the Council of Europe . #% Finally , Mr Blair , may I thank you for staying to listen to the debate here today , which you so rarely do in Westminster . #% If it is not being implemented , is it because it is unworkable ? #% These must then be converted into proper legal form in the manner envisaged by the Treaties . #% By the same token , we think that the provision of air traffic services should be open to liberalisation , subject to what each individual country decides is appropriate for itself . #% We should like to see a strengthening of the directive in relation to consultation in the event of restructuring . #% We hope that he will show his leadership by explaining exactly what he meant by his comments the other day that there is more than one view on Europe 's future . #% Its citizens enjoy some of the best healthcare provisions in Asia . #% In conclusion let me say that Mr Wurtz 's contribution was very revealing of the constant agenda of the left which aims to separate the European Union from the United States and would result in depriving Europe of any real influence in the world . #% Madam President , it is very late , there are very few of us here and I guess all of us are very tired this evening , but actually we are striking a blow in this debate for a citizens ' Europe . #% I want to speak about three areas : context , dialogue and democracy . #% This would help the public to know and to understand what information they should expect . #% I hope that Mr Patten is well briefed on the question of the present detention of the chairman of Media-Most , Mr Vladimir Gusinsky . #% It may not be a road frontier , but the 22 miles of sea at its narrowest point does make a great deal of difference . #% I wanted to thank her for being willing to give her personal attention to these matters . #% It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes , which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality , are devolved and repealed . #% We want to see those militias disarmed and disbanded as soon as possible . #% The Commission has , as Mr Spencer outlined , failed to make proposals as it could do under Article J. 8 . #% in writing . - The initial provisions of this report would have left National Health Service hospitals in my region of north-east England and elsewhere in the UK facing massively increased costs for their heating boilers . #% The committee will carry on its work and we are determined to find out what went wrong with Equitable Life so that these problems do not happen in the future . #% This issue is of growing concern both to the public and to this Parliament , and I think the fact that we were able to attract 60 signatures to our oral question on the subject is a clear testimony to that . #% 
That is why I would argue that we need an exchange of ideas in order to promote change . #% We think ` how can Americans insist on executing people , insist on boycotting the International Criminal Court and insist on denying Guantanamo bay detainees a fair trial ? ' #% Many others outside are completely unaware - as are those of us who are here who happen to wish to speak in this debate - that this issue is being considered . #% In effect , we are constantly adding to the burden of European Union legislation on the environment , with the very good intention of improving our environment , but the Member States are signing up to legislation which they are in many cases unable to put in place in the form in which they adopt it . #% This vote is consistent with my attitude and earlier approach on any suggestions of a euro-style tax system . #% This , of course , is unusual because , generally , national parliaments do not have much to do any more , as the EU Institutions have usurped them . #% Only Syria , Cuba and Venezuela rejected the proposal . #% However , he refused to be cowed by the Islamist fanatics who threatened him with death . #% Although you can not always believe what you read in the press , according to a press release you had asked the US trade representative , Susan Schwab , what she would be able to offer if the EU were to give the US everything it wanted on market access . #% I would like the Commission to tell me just how practical it thinks its measures are going to be and how quickly it will be able to change them if they do not work . #% To some extent , the tabling of this motion has already brought some answers . #% Its record in the transportation of dangerous goods is amongst the best . #% There are others , which are much less responsible , more militant in nature and likely to be present in Seattle . #% We expect that to be up and running by the end of next year and we want there to be money for that . #% Mr President , first of all , and most importantly , I should like to add my strong support for both the Commission proposal and particularly Mr Cabrol 's excellent report which is well drafted and pertinent , as his reports always are . #% Madam President , I thank the Commission and Commissioner Kinnock for being available to make this statement following my request earlier in the week . #% The euro has successfully delivered low inflation , rising growth , falling unemployment and protection for the euro zone economies from the ups and downs of the foreign exchanges . #% The amendment does not seek , in any way , to inhibit any of the benefits for those on all sides of this agreement , but merely seeks to review this potential loophole . #% Dialogue between these two key actors is not enough . #% It is impossible to achieve record levels of car output in the United Kingdom with , in many plants , quality and productivity levels that are the best in Europe , without working between managers and the workforce and with dealers and customers . #% Mr President , I should firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his report and for the work he has done in committee . #% The next convention on the disabled should provide the seventh . #% We look forward to a successful second reading in Parliament after the elections . #% I salute particularly those who have been wounded in the campaign and hope , as the UK is about to become a major component of the UN peacekeeping force , that no further casualties will ensue . #% I have raised , as have other colleagues , our fears about the combined contents of the Framework E-Commerce Directive and the revision to the Brussels and Lugano Conventions . #% Secondly , will the Commission itself note and accept a paradox concerning the tobacco regime . #% I hope that is of some reassurance to Mr Dell ' Alba . #% Clearly it is important to make sure that pollution is not generated in the first place . #% There are provisions in this regulation to open up access , to make access available on fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms , again key words we should be thinking about in any context , particularly in media . #% The majority of the committee chose to support amendments by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities , which strengthen the position of women as a social group liable to persecution in some countries , and have included the example of genital mutilation in line with a previous Parliament decision on the issue . #% What we are trying to do is to ensure that the contract operates and whatever proceeds are left at the other end are then dealt with according to the insolvency law of the home State . #% The reasons she gave are quite spurious . #% We need to tackle this issue urgently and swiftly but in a coherent way . #% It is desirable that individual sectors are covered by rules that are genuinely appropriate to their own particular situations . #% But passenger ferries , oil and chemical tankers have all been subject to terrible accidents associated with human error in Britain and the Continent 's coastal waters in recent years . #% Its approval by both a majority in the elected Parliament and by a qualified majority of governments in the Council is proof of its acceptability to a wide range of opinions . #% Considering its size and complexity , India 's stable and vibrant society remains a monumental achievement . #% Certainly in terms of the ACP-EU negotiations , we have a real opportunity to be centre stage and to be offering that equity and fairness . #% I welcome in particular the economic safeguards in relation to the internal market which we have never had before , and also the commitment to have a further progress report six months before the date of accession . #% Last week I found it easier to enter non-EU Slovenia with my parliamentary laissez-passer than to escape from British jurisdiction where such checks are generally effected in triplicate . #% The data protection supervisors are firm that the processing of such data should normally be prohibited . #% Members of this House may think otherwise , but this is a cynical attempt to hijack the Games in order to promote the European agenda . #% However , since I do not consider the proposed Committee of Inquiry will affect me financially , I voted in favour of the inquiry . #% I call upon the Council of Ministers - who , of course , are not here - and also the Commission to remain strong and determined and tackle the problem . #% About the promises we received of how things were going to get better for 2005 - but of course some Members forget that we are actually dealing with the accounts for 2001 and exactly how they were reflected . #% For instance , the number of children under the age of 18 suffering from thyroid cancer is 50 times higher now than before the accident . #% Mr President , we should be clear that already some 17 Jews have already been executed in Iran for charges of espionage , which basically involves no more than contacting anyone in the outside world , certainly anyone in Israel or the United States . #% What is new in this directive is the monitoring of low pathogen avian influenza for the first time in Europe . #% Around 350 million women are still denied access to safe family planning . #% Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation . #% It is time to stub out the unhealthy depressing habit to which too many of our younger citizens will become addicted and from which too many more will die unless we and our national governments succeed . #% I would be interested in your views on that . #% The new amendments , such as the one excluding industry to which the Commissioner referred when he talked about industry 's fears that trading activities might be affected or constrained , are also to be welcomed . #% However , I think this debate today timely , against the background of the situation in Germany , where rail workers , policemen and even protesters against nuclear issues have been irradiated . #% We wholeheartedly support her , and the fact that we did not express it on this occasion is a technical - I could use a ruder word - mistake for which , I am afraid , a number of us probably bear responsibility . #% I say these things to the President-in-Office because we are seen as a European Union that practises double standards : we are seen to ignore every Israeli illegality , but to expect Palestinians to behave like saints . #% There is added complexity because the conflicts with the West have long been bound up with internal disagreements within Iran itself . #% I would have thought there is a need for even more action than he has just spoken about . #% I know that the Netherlands , with its long experience of beating back floodwaters at home , already supports considerable projects in Bangladesh , but I wonder what more can be done in the future . #% What we would like this year - and we have tabled an amendment to this effect with one or two other points - is to have not only a report about what the Commission has done , but also a report showing what has gone wrong with the reforms and what still needs to be done to ensure that there is proper communication - Eurostat is only one example , though a rather high-profile one . #% Therefore in terms of EU reform we are right , as a parliament , to say that we do not wish to see new posts until we know where the posts are going . #% We hope that we will now see some genuine results from our endeavours . #% In the Cambridgeshire Fens , which have been part of the # 50m 5-B Programme across East Anglia , but where 73 % of villages have no food shops , 74 % no daily bus service and not one a bank , these decisions offer hope . #% However , exceptional measures are sometimes necessary to deal with potential threats to national security . #% There are a lot of imponderables . #% We have all had representations from the medical profession and we should respect the ethics of self-advertisement in most self-respecting medical professions throughout the Community . #% 
The threshold of alcohol in the bloodstream has been reduced very substantially in a lot of the Member States to deal with this matter . #% My group has considered it very carefully and we conclude that it is a technical putting into effect of the agreement that the Parliament has signed on parliamentary immunity , and privileges will not be removed without due process . #% Mr President , on a point of order , can we assume from that intervention that all the other Members of the British Labour Delegation believe in socialist principles ? #% Mr President , naturally I join in the chorus of praise for the efforts of the rapporteur . #% They have not created real ease of access to justice . #% I should like to make one further suggestion . #% The EU 's Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument must fill this void and work closely with the UN system to take advantage of our pooled resources and see to it that when our friends need us we come to their aid . #% Of course I will do what he says . #% Every kilogram of smuggled meat in the EU food chain poses a real threat not only of animal diseases , but also human ones , such as Ebola . #% I would like to hear the presidency give us its observations about where we go from here in the conference , because it can be a major force . #% Hamas ' decision to swap bullets for ballots potentially marks a strategic shift that could lead to talks with Israel . #% . Mr President , the common fisheries policy affects the UK more than many other Member States . #% Secondly , but more fundamentally , bread is a commodity that is regulated nationally under many specific regulations . #% I have visited in Germany CHP schemes based on waste incineration which are to be commended . #% If he retains his power , we can not be sure in the future that he will not once more go back to spending three-quarters of his gross national product on weapons , 15 , 16 , 17 billion dollars ' worth of new weapons in the region year on year . #% Like Mr Stevenson we welcome the Commission 's proposals to allocate the financial compensation to measures which promote institutional development , marine surveillance , research , training and quality control . #% The motivation behind my question is the gap between rhetoric and reality . #% I also believe that , in order to take account of the wider considerations and in view of the relatively small role which farming has in our economy these days , we also need to look at preventive vaccination as a long-term solution to difficulties of this kind . #% When we talk about disability and development , we are not talking about charity but about basic human rights . #% We must be careful not to set a level of lead so low that it will effectively prohibit the use of batteries containing even trace elements of lead for important purposes , notably in hearing aids . #% I think we need to know and I think it shows the strength of feeling across this Parliament that we have been able to come together on a broad compromise , even though we may have slight differences and nuances here , to agree on a common text . #% In all of them high rates of illiteracy , grinding poverty and the crushing burden of international debt were endemic , as those of us who have visited the area have seen . #% The celebrations in Independence Square in Kiev on Boxing Day evening , welcoming the rebirth of democracy in Ukraine , were an inspiration . #% I thank the rapporteur and all those who helped with this . #% To quote briefly from the article , `` In its assessment of countries , the Commission will tell France that , like Germany , it must reduce ` fiscal pressure ' on labour and reduce the ` administrative burden on companies ' . '' #% Mr President , it is not often that I completely agree with my colleague in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , Mr von Boetticher , but this time I agree with him that we need a national choice regime to allow opt-out on e-mails and I am speaking against the socialist amendments . #% There is no easy way forward . #% They have decided that they want their faces to be up on the global stage , not somebody from the European Union , and so we have got appointed a couple of political pygmies . #% The first question : firstly , in the memorandum of understanding signed by the Belgian Minister Mr Rik Dams and me on behalf of the Commission on 17 July 2001 , it was anticipated that the negotiations on the Berlaymont should be concluded by the end of December 2001 . #% Without interfering in the politics of Spain , there is a saying in the United Kingdom which suggests that you put your own house in order first . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , this goes beyond Ireland . #% Mr President , it is clearly important for the European Parliament that we have this debate . #% What we do not want is a complete mixing of decoupling . #% This is an important and forward-looking proposal because gaseous fuels are increasingly being used - and I refer for example to things like liquefied natural gas and petroleum gas - and there is also the prospect of hydrogen becoming a fuel in the future . #% The assertion that Bulgaria is the only accession country that lacks implementation mechanisms in the field of gender equality is frankly not correct . #% I hear my opponents say : there is Lord Inglewood representing the forces of reaction , flying in the face of the Community ' s honourable tradition of consumer protection and arguing at variance with the detailed terms of existing European Community consumer protection legislation . #% I wish it well and again congratulate our rapporteur . #% We hope the industry in general will heed these proposals . #% I know that as a new Member three years ago I had great difficulty in Brussels and Strasbourg even in finding rooms . #% While thanking Mr Patijn for that answer one wonders about his commitment to assisting the IGC to be an open and transparent process . #% It is absurd to claim that US peacekeepers would run the gauntlet of anti-American prejudice . #% Only last week , the Environmental Justice Foundation published a report on illegal fishing in Guinea and its links to the European Union . #% I very much agree with all of that . #% Well , what a reference standard to have ! #% Then they borrow , and they borrow , and - worse - they then print money , because politicians and their central banks have a machine which prints money . #% On behalf of my own country , we appreciate that the United Kingdom is the biggest beneficiary of this programme : some ECU 2.7 bn - over # 2bn . #% Mr President , my amendment , which has now been accepted , was to be added to paragraph 16 . #% Common , Europe-wide standards will inevitably create a more balanced distribution of asylum claims throughout the EU . #% At a time when the EU is demanding more and more visa controls from third country nationals , it seems a bit ironic that we then ask other countries to drop their visa requirements . #% That was the sole purpose of the letter . #% Iran needs regional stability , and this has been recognised by the Iranian leadership . #% But , if only the science and technology base was stronger , climate change could also be an opportunity for Africa . #% It is important for us to recognise that under the Rules of Procedure of Parliament the information acquired inside a temporary Committee of Inquiry is to remain secret only if it contributes to the writing of the inquiry report . #% Nothing else will solve the problems or lessen the human rights abuses . #% The process of having quotas for fish and throwing healthy fish overboard over the years has also contributed greatly to the position we are in . #% The new regime would apply from the 2001/2002 marketing year which , as the honourable Member will know , begins on 1 November 2001 . #% Mr Cornelissen speaks from both the head and from the heart in terms of his commitment to road safety . #% They provide essential rights for consumers but they will allow a sector that is changing very fast to thrive and develop in the future without unnecessary and complex interference . #% Again and again the EU assumes illegitimately the role and characteristics of a political state . #% Either of those would create a new Asian bloc that , along with the European Union and NAFTA , would produce a tri-polar world with all its inherent instabilities . #% Would the President-in-Office undertake to investigate this and try to conserve the stocks of fish , many of which are destroyed in their infancy ? #% When they came for the Jews , I did not speak out because I was not a Jew . #% Only one amendment was not adopted - that concerned cabin baggage - and it will be resubmitted to Parliament . #% Vessels must be crewed by seafarers who possess the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge . #% In Japan there has been a Diet Members ' League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty since 1993 . #% The exact cost of these financing instruments is still unknown , despite the best efforts of my colleagues yesterday and first thing this morning . #% 
Many Members may be interested to hear what is actually happening at the moment and to note that nearly a quarter of a million cattle under the 30 months scheme have been slaughtered since the scheme began , a quarter of a million cattle , and they are still moving at the rate of 30 000 per week . #% However , as you know - and you drew attention to this in your speech - there is concern in Parliament about giving respect to the institutional triangle . #% In view of the recent EU-wide publicity and concerns expressed about DU shells and the hazards posed by the dust in particular if inhaled by soldiers and civilians , particularly children playing in the vicinity of where there has been bomb damage , have the Commissioner 's views changed since then ? #% It is about business-to-business , risk and the spread of that risk by the insurance industry . #% It does not get the grant from Europe because at NUTS II it is classified with Hampshire . #% Nevertheless , perhaps we can finish before the dinner break . #% This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources . #% That record was last broken in 1972 . #% Finally , I would like to thank Mr Lange and Mrs Corbey for making me see sense , and Mr Davies for finally coming round to our way of thinking . #% What is being proposed is to try to make some headway towards resolving those factors . #% With regard to Turkey , there remain many concerns over human rights , the ongoing blockade of Armenia , religious freedoms and the refusal to admit Cypriot ships to Turkish ports . #% In Europe we spend EUR 2.5 billion each year on olives , we spent less than EUR 2 billion over six years on the Socrates Programme . #% But it points out where responsibility rests and it will be for Member States to spell that out in detail so there is no uncertainty . #% This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region . #% It is important that transparent judgments are made which will then be universally applied . #% I would like to thank Commissioner Patten personally for his total and transparent collaboration with the working group on scrutiny of EU funds to the Palestinian authority which is now up and running and will reach its conclusion by next year . #% It has been discussed in the Committee on Petitions , all sorts of promises have been made and we are due to debate it again this week , but so far we have seen precious little action . #% But we must be aware that , while it is correct to have global aspirations , we have serious work to do in our own back yard . #% Can I take it that the Commission is giving an assurance that trade negotiations can go ahead , irrespective of the US position on the Helms-Burton Act , and that it will be protecting European companies ? #% Finally , a lot of sensitive information may emerge as a result of this process . #% Madam President , I should like to say at the outset that I agree with those who have said that we have to look to the future . #% We are quite pleased with that as well . #% Finally , my Group looks forward to receiving from the Commission its new proposals regarding slot-allocation , even though they have been a long time in coming . #% This can be done because it is very self-contained , it is tax on a particular product . #% Most of Parliament 's committees are regularly attended by representatives of the Council . #% It is vital that there are common policies , agreements and understandings between the 15 Member States . #% Perhaps - although that is more debatable - there is no functional necessity to have a larger College of Quaestors . #% Can we have an assurance that this total of 141 personnel will not be exceeded ? #% I am not sure that I share the Commission 's idea that we should be looking at enlargement as the sole focus of our energies . #% We have therefore abstained on the final vote in order to reflect our support for the fight against fraud within the EU , whilst protecting our position on the European Public Prosecutor . #% I have always taken the line that the deepening of the Union is as important , if not more important , than its widening . #% The amendments by Mr Nassauer may bring some reassurances to his group and other MEPs who are concerned that some private information may get into the public domain . #% I am very conscious of the heavy burden you bear , Commissioner . #% We are sadly far behind the United States and , if tomorrow we support the amendments proposed by Mrs Wallis , we will stay far behind the United States . #% I hope that in the vote tomorrow we achieve what we intend , as I have set it out this evening . #% My group has tabled two amendments again for plenary . #% That is the key to delivery of this Lisbon Agenda . #% We have a situation where the financial perspective has great problems with heading 3 , heading 4 and certainly heading 5 . #% I would like to tackle some of the issues that were raised , in the couple of minutes I have been afforded . #% A lot of the work is done behind closed doors ; it is invisible . #% It is a problem that arose in Mr Nisticò 's report on blood . #% He proposed a five point plan to reverse that failure and a push by world leaders to restart and complete the trade talks . #% I share the rapporteur 's concern that the movement of young animals , which must present at least some element of risk , should be subject to the same constraints as that of other categories . #% This is a chance to make Europe relevant to people and not just to markets . #% Last weekend the London published Mr Blair 's next speech in Brussels , which included the words : ` here you breathe the sweet smell of Belgium 's unique brand of corruption , which it has generously bestowed on the rest of Europe ' . #% It has had several meetings with me asking whether I can get further support for my amendments in that respect . #% Mr President , Commissioner , may I start by declaring an interest , or two interests , in this issue . #% Finally , the voluntary donation of blood - which is an important principle for us in Britain in particular - has the added benefit of ensuring the highest possible voluntary screening-out of the health risk associated with blood transfusion . #% It is far from clear what these consequences will be . #% I wish to begin by thanking Mr Bowis for his report , which reflects his own very strong personal commitment not only to the JPA but also to development . #% He has done an excellent job here and is quite rightly using very specific language about some of the shortcomings of Member States . #% We want to stamp out this appalling abuse . #% This is an area where Europe has so much to offer , but the whole engagement needs to be stepped up and integrated with an overall development policy . #% . Mr President , it is a little difficult to give an opinion on this when half my colleagues seem to believe that there is no point in giving an opinion because we can not alter the Convention text . #% I am intrigued by your replies , Commissioner . #% I am of course convinced that what I say is correct , but if I am proved wrong then I am more than happy to accept that . #% Mr Gargani asked for the lower volume vehicle limit to be raised and a compromise has been reached to raise that to a thousand vehicles for simplified type approval , a major benefit for the smaller serious producers . #% He is a man so important that he is beyond criticism , beyond reproach ; he is the king of the modern political class . #% It would be perverse to reward them for this progress by denying them the resources and support to maintain their pro-Western trajectory , simply on the basis that the Southern Dimension has more acute need of the EU 's attentions now . #% Kendal was the first Fair Trade borough and now Lancashire Council has pledged to become the first Fair Trade county . #% Folic acid is an example . #% That is why the Commission proposal is so welcome . #% It is important for Parliament to vote against this report , because very recently we adopted the tobacco directive , which , as we all know , took various public health measures to reduce smoking . #% Will there really be equality of enforcement in European waters ? #% No one underestimates the value and importance of these substances : they are very effective flame retardants and they save lives . #% Most of the money will go into administration , allocation and assessment , and precious little to getting results . #% 
As well as demanding a complete reassessment of the trade model , it is clear that we also urgently need to redouble our efforts to ensure that international trade is based on a platform of minimum social and environmental standards . #% Mr Haarder , take the message back to the Council : no more blocking , delay , subsidiarity or hiding behind the IMO - action is what we demand ! #% Secondly , why do we always have to debate this on Fridays ? #% The Kyoto Protocol created certain expectations and the impression of the European Parliament is that things have been allowed to go to sleep for far too long after the negotiations on that protocol were concluded . #% We in the United Kingdom are especially proud to celebrate figures that have helped our nation progress in the field of women 's rights : women such as Emily Pankhurst , leader of the British Suffragettes , which won women the right to vote , Shirin Ebadi , winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for her efforts in promoting human rights , especially for women , and Margaret Thatcher , the first British woman Prime Minister , elected in 1979 . #% I also wish to take this opportunity to salute the courage , fortitude and peaceful resistance of the Tibetan people whose example is an inspiration to us all . #% Paragraph 12 of the joint resolution calls for closer cooperation and dialogue between Ukraine and the European Parliament on energy-related matters . #% The purpose of this proposal for a Council directive on which your opinion is requested is to provide protection as regards supplementary pension schemes for the pension rights of workers and members of their families who move from one Member State of the European Union to another . #% I asked if you would seek to increase funding directly to Colombian human rights organizations . #% Is no account taken of the fact that unlike other states the United States has not attempted to reach an agreement on compensation for properties which were nationalized ? #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , on behalf of my group , I would like to thank my colleague , Andreas Schwab , for handling a very complex dossier very skilfully . #% If they speak to any of the residents in that locality , they will see what a silly amendment that is . #% However , inclusion of those people who are not mobile workers but in sedentary employment in offices serving people who are mobile , is to correct what was thought to be a mistake in the previous working time directive when they were excluded . #% I am especially concerned about the effects on the whole marine eco-system of the North Sea of the intense industrial fishing mainly by Danish boats . #% I just wish it had been made consistently on both communities over the last five years . #% We have been told by two of our own senior people that they do not have the right to pursue such issues . #% The question is asked - the opinion of the Council about federalism - about surrendering sovereignty to majority voting . #% I hope that it would be possible , since officials of the Polish parliament and Polish ministries will have to deal with this Parliament and assist , in the course of time , Polish Members of this Parliament , that the training could also involve links with Parliament and , indeed , Members of Parliament . #% I am disappointed that the outcome document for the working group on the review omits any independent trigger for special sessions , that there is no requirement for member countries to justify failure to respond to recommendations , and that there is no provision at all for addressing specific country situations . #% European Union and US farmers are subsidy junkies and although the agreement does not spell an end to this transatlantic addiction , it may be a step in the right direction . #% I believe that we have to look much more carefully at this question , to tackle those countries that behave disgracefully ; the so-called fingernail-pulling governments need to be taken to task , and the European Parliament must be the institution that takes the lead in making sure that human rights are top of our agenda . #% That will be the right time to ensure that we give re-use the priority it deserves . #% I am mindful that audits are not very popular in the European Commission and that auditors -- if they do their job properly -- get fired , but nonetheless here goes : #% The remedy is very simple : to change the Council 's rules of procedure , as Mr Hammerstein Mintz makes clear in his report . #% We supported the Socialist Group amendments to remove beneficiaries of subsidiary protection in the light of the Commissioner 's pledge to bring forward a proposal covering them as well as beneficiaries of temporary protection . #% These are things that will really mean something to all consumers and users of electronic communication services . #% As regards the proposal of the PPE-DE and PSE Groups that the Governing Council should decide by a double majority system , giving more weight to the members from the big Member States , we beg to differ . #% Sharia has recently been introduced in parts of Nigeria as part of a process of Islamicisation . #% So let us hope that the funding reaches some of those people who need it . #% Could I get some kind of feeling from the Council that they consider this as important as the Commission does ? #% Commissioner , you , in effect , have said the same thing but in a more eloquent way . #% The European Court of Justice is not a court of justice , it is an engine of political integration for the European Union . #% The Thai Government , too , could help . #% The progress of this Green Paper through the European Parliament has been accompanied by detailed conferences and major debates . #% If we look at the European Union 's cheque stubs we discover that 40 % of our expenditure goes on agriculture for less than 5 % of the population . #% What we want , President-in-Office , are not solemn declarations from the Council . #% However , the EU remains concerned about the human rights situation in Tunisia , particularly in relation to freedom of expression and assembly and the independence of the judiciary . #% We are not protectionists , but we want good common sense . #% It is , therefore , the work of many hands and if this debate today is considered , calm and , I hope , rational it is because of the extent to which the three sides in the triangle of forces have attempted to come to an agreed conclusion by the time of this second reading debate , in order to expedite the introduction of the new authority itself . #% For those who are interested , the details are on the website . #% Already many are suspicious of the genuineness of Pakistan 's commitments in its war against terrorism and the disappearance of the records of Pakistan 's relations with North Korea is worrying . #% in writing . - History is littered with wars over access to land and oil , but I fear they will pale into insignificance when compared to likely future conflicts over access to water . #% Commissioner , thank you for that full substantive answer , which I fully support . #% That is one of the main reasons we use the opt-out . #% As it is , this debate has been remarkable for the chorus of Greens , Liberal Democrats and Socialists hymning the prospects of GM foods subject to safeguards . #% A visit to Managua should be made . #% Firstly , with regard to separator trawls or nets with sorting grids used in shrimp fisheries ; secondly , the revision of minimum sizes for a number of bivalve molluscs and crustaceans ; and thirdly , with respect to the establishment of a closed area for fishing for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland . #% In the Holy Koran there are clear statements of respect for other faiths . #% The European Union has an important role to play in identifying the similarities and the differences in the way the Member States react to these changes . #% Yet I have a warning : this should not be used by the unsavoury regimes around the world as an excuse to evade EU sanctions -- smart or otherwise . #% However , the cost of all this is really about EU taxation for a centralised Europe and funding a satellite , is it not ? #% You gave us a list of initiatives the Commission would take , but they are already in progress , or should be priorities in any case . #% This , however , is the worst possible means of seeking to achieve that . #% Just because it may produce a big player or a big corporation it is not necessarily wrong for the market or anti-competitive . #% If Turkey has been granted candidate status , surely a country like Ukraine has just as much , if not more , of a claim to be a candidate for the European family of nations in an enlarged , wider and looser European Union . #% Firstly , when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal . #% Mr President , I take issue with most of my colleagues who have spoken in the debate so far , as regards their desire to rush into some form of undefined new directive or regulation on so-called concentration and media ownership . #% The fundamentals of our situation remain unchanged : the EU is heavily dependent on oil and heavily dependent on imports of oil . #% The adoption of the GSM standard has meant that the European Union has a tremendous advantage . #% Having read the legislation we all know that the non-OECD countries have been written to at least three times asking if they wish to accept waste textiles on the green list of waste of the Basle Convention . #% However , the AKP 's mildly Islamist leanings also give rise to concern in the views of some , and the party 's popularity tends to indicate a fundamental paradigm shift in the nature of Turkish society . #% I would like to welcome the President-in-Office 's response to my colleague 's question but pick up the part about venture capital . #% Romania is an integral part of that process and social change in the last few months has been rapid . #% That is referred to quite clearly in the text . #% That was in North Aceh . #% This directive will ban the production of all new barometers . #% 
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident ? #% Will you clarify , President-in-Office , whether you will be offering additional funds for the EPA negotiations , or whether you expect such funding to come from the ACP 's tenth EDF ? #% However , just as their faith in the Maginot Line failed them in 1940 , once again the enemies of free , independent states are coming in around the side and engulfing all . #% Specifically we welcome the references to equal opportunities including the old as well as the young unemployed and for the need to promote employment of the disabled . #% This is the kind of thing that could be monitored through our ACP relationship with 78 countries . #% It should be emphasized again and again that no scientist has yet been able to establish a conclusive link between BSE and the new variant of CJD . #% Firstly , would he agree that it would be desirable for the proposed directive on the internal market for services to cover gambling in this way ? #% If we slow down , some of the accession countries - for example , Hungary - will turn elsewhere , perhaps towards the United States rather than the European Union . #% It would be very interesting for all of us to have the opinion of the Commission specifically on those . #% many of our members support the death penalty , moreover decisions on this matter should be a national responsibility ; #% Furthermore , it would destroy public confidence in the very high quality of European poultry meat . #% It is not just our health , but the health of our staff and the many visitors in this House that is at risk . #% If we are to succeed in our ambitions at a price we can afford , we have to ensure that we get better value for money out of defence and , in particular , defence industries . #% I reiterate that the EU must have a consistent approach and should not extradite individuals to countries where they may be at risk of incurring the death penalty . #% It was far too weak when we introduced it . #% We know a recommendation , alas , is simply not worth the paper it is written on . #% Now is perhaps the time , he said , for Plan B - something , I hasten to add , that the Committee on International Trade has been looking for for a long time . #% I do support many of the measures promoted in the report and in the Green 's amendments , particularly around the Green New Deal , the end of national rebates and Own Resources for the EU , and am mindful that part of the above-inflation increase is needed to meet obligations under the Lisbon Treaty . #% This raises the point of your 500 non-permanent posts , which we are going to have to examine in detail . #% Too many times in the past the nuclear industry has got its sums wrong and then come begging for financial assistance . #% It will be a flexible instrument and one which we have been in need of for some time . #% Mr President , may I thank Mr Watson on behalf of our committee for bringing this report to plenary . #% So , let us call it the Commission 's little red book , no , let us call it the Commission 's big green book , albeit one with a few black spots on its pages . #% Every single rapporteur at least had the decency to say that these proposals should be rejected until the Lisbon Treaty was legally in force . #% It is also true that we take the pressure off the roads . #% It appears to me that the Commission is attempting progressively to break down the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe into bite-sized chunks , aided and abetted , in this case , by our own government . #% Finally , I wish to speak particularly for my constituents in East Anglia , many of whom have not drawn on the common agricultural policy because they grow crops which have never been subsidised by this Union . #% It ought not to be necessary really but given the inefficiency of some of the airlines it might help . #% This organization was catching , landing and processing herring and mackerel for major multiples . #% Secondly , I would put to him that there is a major interest in the accession countries . #% I thank everybody for their support and I hope this will go forward with great vigour . #% Now there is much that we can do here and much that the Commission and the various Member States ' governments could do . #% She and I come from quite different points on the political spectrum but , in the Committee on Petitions , we all find that we share a common interest , regardless of nationality or politics , in protecting the rights of the individual citizen . #% The prime aim of the private sector companies , which are trying to get the EU to allow them to cream off the profitable parts of the postal service , is to make a good profit for their shareholders . #% In particular , it extends Article 3 of Directive 93/43 which introduces what are know as the HACCP principles . #% I hope the fact that I have been invited to speak second , not fifth , is clear recognition of the true significance and importance of this proposal . #% In Germany , skin cancer among agricultural workers has risen by between 15 % and 20 % over the last decade alone . #% Hopefully , in November we may get something more positive . #% This place is the problem , it is not the solution . #% Mr President , I also welcome the progress made in this report on the Fiscalis programme for the next five years . #% Now with the Helms-Burton Bill , we even have the American Government taking non-American companies to court over trading with Cuba . #% As a strong supporter of the transatlantic relationship , I would have voted in favour . #% To me , Lisbon is all about creating a Europe of highly-paid , highly-skilled , high-value-added jobs . #% I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt ' s report brings us . #% This is our opportunity to reunite Europe , to build a whole continent built on the principles of peace , stability and prosperity . #% She did , after all , withdraw many of her initial amendments , tabling new ones which move closer to , or back to , the common position on a number of elements including key action and exposure limit values . #% The JPC noted the need to closely monitor progress with the SAPARD , Phare and Ispra programmes and to ensure that Lithuania is fully prepared to exploit the structural and rural funding possibilities after accession . #% In 2001 James Baker proposed a five-year period of autonomy within Morocco before holding the referendum , but Polisario rejected it , particularly on the issue of who would be allowed to vote . #% Colleagues from the South Essex Rape and Incest Crisis Line tell me that posters in shops , public houses and at bus-stops enabled the issue of violence against women to be discussed in the open and validated the private experiences of many women for the very first time . #% Secondly , is the Commissioner aware that President Mandela has urged the West not to demonize Mr Kabila in Kinshasa and impressed on us that it would be suicidal for us to suggest that political parties , for instance , should be formed in Zaire at this time ? #% The Commission is at present implementing , or preparing legal grounds for implementing , the different actions set out in the White Paper on reforming the Commission . #% I hope that it will also be embraced with equal fervour by the Commission and the full Council . #% We must not allow ourselves to be side-tracked by debates and possible disagreement over the details of the mechanics of how this process of technical transposition is to be put into effect , because if we do that it gets in the way of achieving the necessary political agreement . #% Cooperation would cease and national security would be put at risk . #% The greatest benefits of the new Constitution are that , on the one hand , it constrains the EU , but on the other , it liberates it . #% Firstly , we remind the Commission that achieving Lisbon Strategy objectives is , and must remain , the major priority . #% However , as Eurocontrol predicts , EU air traffic movements are set to more than double by 2020 compared to 2003 . #% By 2020 , Europe will be 90 % dependent on Russia for oil . #% But our main concern is the attempt by the Council and the big groups to confer broad powers to require telecommunications companies and Internet service providers to keep data which map people 's daily lives and contacts , that is traffic , billing , location data and so on for possible access by law enforcement agencies . #% I particularly want to speak about doctors in training . #% Mr President , the reason I and many Conservative , or European Democrat , colleagues abstained on the vote overall is that there is an unacceptable reference in Paragraph 37 to the UK/Spanish talks on the future of Gibraltar which in no way takes into consideration the views of the 30,000 Gibraltarians who clearly wish to retain their sovereign link with Britain . #% That is why I am very happy to commend the rapporteur on this and to congratulate the Commissioner for bringing it forward . #% ' It is good news that Milosovic and Rugova will meet face to face on Friday . #% Insofar as the primary area is concerned , we are talking about exclusion and risk factors , e.g. smoking and drinking and too much exposure to sunshine , and the secondary area deals with early detection which is where the whole question about routine examinations and checkups comes in . #% in writing . - I consider the role of Parliament to be only effective if it can sustain the effect of legislation . #% The people will reject the idea of a Europe based only on austerity . #% 
Some Members of this Parliament feel it was irresponsible . #% Financial control ' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate . #% Our Member States and the institutions of the European Union then need to support them by reducing the burdens they face . #% Currently much of Community production is either destroyed or offloaded on poor countries at below production cost , to add to their health problems . #% We will have a number of more difficult cases to assess for employers between those two extremes that I have given as an example . #% I support references strengthening cooperation between Member States in addressing wage discrimination for equal jobs and action protecting women and men against all forms of violence , including human trafficking and female genital mutilation , but we also need to see strong steps towards empowerment of women through increasing confidence in their abilities , through education and through moves to create an environment which encourages choice . #% That decision will certainly lead to public discontent . #% If that is the experience of a directive already passed into European law , can the President-in-Office please ensure that the interests of the consumers and of small businesses come first when you deliberate on this subject ? #% Many of these parents have now decided to petition this Parliament . #% The seriousness of the issue demands that we give it a prominent position on the agenda . #% It will all be downhill from here . #% That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock . #% In addition , some parts of the text are potentially ambiguous with areas of legal confusion e.g. paragraph nine on indirect sanctions to be applied to Member States ( paragraph nine ) and the call to extend the powers of the European Court of Justice in its rulings over instruments decided outside the sphere of the EU . #% But it is not just words we need , it is actions , it is deeds , and we can not rely on Member States to do this alone . #% We have to find a way of simplifying things for citizens themselves and for the administrators of these systems . #% We know that anti-retroviral prices are an increasingly serious public health hazard -- that is a statement by the WHO . #% There is no evidence to suggest that the UK derogation affects or skews the internal European market . #% Its economy remains undiversified - sadly - relying mainly on tourism and one aluminium smelter . #% That is an historic step forward and one that I believe they will not regret . #% As I said in my opening remarks , in the aftermath of the Enron collapse in the United States , this proposal is timely because it is highly unlikely that such a debacle could have occurred under this approach to accounting standards , which is purposive or teleological as opposed to prescriptive . #% I hope that , if possible , we will get a statement from the Council at that meeting , with the assistance of the Commission . #% I also welcome the White Paper . #% These are going to be the organizations which are going to grow . #% Bulgaria should have no difficulty with that and I hope that Romania will meet that target as well , but I would not like to think that Bulgaria 's aspirations would in any way be held back by slower progress on the part of her northern neighbour . #% The point that we continually try to make in our representations is that regardless of the precise numbers there is a principle of humanity to be followed , and we want to see it applied without any further delay . #% So far as I am concerned , the whole shark fin regulation has always been too weak . #% But in the Socialist Group we also place great emphasis on full respect for Article 105 of the Treaty which means that when price stability has been achieved the Central Bank helps in the broader objectives of the European Union , in particular in job creation and growth . #% It codifies the procedure for the approval process , the organisation of the hearings , the questions , the issues of transparency and the decision-making process of each committee . #% We can encourage producers to move away from seeing animals as just units of production and set high standards of animal welfare and veterinary care on the farm and in transit . #% It will help millions of European old people to retire in the sun . #% The impact of growth in Asia on energy supply is phenomenal . #% In the offshore sector , Amendment No 6 - we have looked long and hard to try to come up with a formulation that will make sure that we get a collective agreement leading to the maximum flexibility available under the directive , that is annualisation of working time . #% I will be supporting this report which reinforces our agreement with the Republic of Korea on scientific and technological cooperation . #% Of all the many words in this communication , just one short paragraph is devoted to this issue . #% Furthermore , the imposition of a special administrative penalty and , in particular , of fines set at a flat rate on the basis of the sole criterion of the cubic capacity of the vehicle -- with no account being taken of the age of that vehicle -- as well as of an increased duty , which , in some cases , can amount to up to ten times the taxes in question , is -- not only in my opinion , but in the opinion of the Commission -- incompatible with the Community principle of proportionality . #% This House should support the agreement but demand that the human rights situation is kept under close attention . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , this is an important debate tonight with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , to demonstrate that the Services Directive - into which we put so much effort in the last Parliament under Evelyne Gebhardt 's leadership , with many colleagues , including myself , being involved - is absolutely indispensable to the creation of future growth and jobs in the European economy . #% We need to know why certain Member States have not correctly implemented these directives . #% This would mean that I could catch the 6 p.m. flight , assuming of course it still exists , to City Airport . #% We do not want to disrupt that process . #% It is believed that he will do whatever is necessary to achieve the magic figure of 77 % . #% We needed to see that openness and transparency did not prevent democracy from flourishing , but actually improved it . #% He has certainly gained a reputation in committee for having an extremely good technical understanding of the subject matters involved . #% I can not say anything about German hooligans but I can talk about English football hooligans - I can not say ` fans ' and even the word ` hooligan ' is not strong enough for them . #% Soon , we will at last have audit power for Eurostat , all the more important now because it is the key that can make other plans about economic surveillance effective . #% It is not enough for any Member State to work alone in combating crime . #% I thought it was a joke when I first read it . #% This was a great shame , because so many people had travelled to Durban with the serious intent to tell the world of real daily suffering . #% I am also surprised that you are surprised that this is the sort of thing that happens when you tear down all the border controls . #% There should be no retreat from that position whatsoever . #% It is energy consumption that we should be focusing on . #% By allocating money to research these illnesses , the EU would be seen to be working for real causes that affect real people 's lives . #% On the contrary , I said we fully understood those reasons , and that she has our every sympathy . #% The EU and Saudi Arabia have shared vital foreign policy interests , such as supporting the Middle Eastern peace process , encouraging the Saudis as Sunni Muslims to contain expansionist Shia Iran and supporting the Saudi fight against al-Qa ` ida , many of whose adherents , unfortunately , come from Saudi Arabia originally . #% Without the Constitution , things will not work properly and the quality of policy flowing from Brussels and Strasbourg will begin to decline . #% There are still problems for people who are in marriages or partnerships with non-EU nationals . #% I am really delighted that she has taken on this role . #% This is vital because Russia has left us in little doubt as to its own designs on the Arctic , famously planting a Russian flag on the seabed of the North Pole in 2007 . #% We all know that if the Council had not given in then Parliament itself would have conceded rather than lose either directive . #% We see nothing wrong with his Amendment No 1 , but we actually think it is better placed within the first reading . #% In our amendments , we are also proposing that , as a priority , poultry farmers be offered common , seasonal influenza vaccination , in order to reduce the chances of recombination between human and avian influenza viruses at one of the most important potential interfaces , as Mr Trakatellis has said . #% This will probably be his last plenary session -- I am breaking news here . #% Second , there is an urgent need for a Europe-wide harmonised system of operations by way of an EU-ops . #% Competition is excellent - we agree with the internal market - in that it is a way of raising standards generally and can also be a way of raising standards in the services concerned , but not for its own sake . #% We have seen a degree of restraint that we have to welcome . #% Member States need to be much more proactive in recognising the special needs of the disabled , and we hope that they will very much take on board the thrust as well as some of the specific ideas in this report . #% 
Everything but arms represents significant progress . #% We would all be interested to know how the educational systems achieve competence in two modern languages in addition to the mother tongue . #% There has been a lot of discussion tonight about issues , particularly involving sustainability and ecological procurement . #% Most EU States , except for Austria , Greece and Luxembourg , now produce their own annual reports , albeit with a huge variance in the quality of information provided . #% Everyone 's interests would be served - in particular Parliament 's interests - if it were possible for Parliament to arrive at its opinion this year , simply because that would then facilitate consideration of any revisions that Parliament proposed or any opinions that it presented . #% Mr Vitorino said politely what many of us in Parliament are saying rather more rudely , that the Council and Member States need to get their act together on asylum and immigration . #% I congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur . #% We on this side of the House are not prepared to let that happen . #% What is needed is the political will to make it happen . #% Five countries , including Britain , France and the United States , have been in material breach of this particular article of international law for over three decades . #% I would hope that you could ensure that guarantee extends to everybody . #% One only has to look at paragraphs 15 to 18 to see how serious we are about the buildings policy . #% The Commission needs to encourage what I call a toolkit for digital authors . #% In addition , a dialogue to prepare the MEDA-funded projects related to migration has been established . #% Such agreements have to be in the public domain , whether multilateral or bilateral , and this Parliament has yet to receive documents promised by the Italian authorities after our visit to Lampedusa . #% That , of course , is true . #% Furthermore , the precise composition and quantities of such products should be clearly stated on the label . #% If our democratic role in monitoring is to be effective , Article 202 of the Treaty must reflect codecision over implementing committees , otherwise there will be always be a bias in this House against the delegation of powers that are necessary to deal with some extremely technical matters . #% In conclusion , we believe the rapporteur - and indeed the Commission - deserve our support in improving aviation in the European Union and beyond because we believe their proposals will ensure fair competition , they will be good for the consumer and they will be good for competitive airlines . #% On specifics , there is one comment I would like to make about agriculture . #% I always appreciate his words and certainly acknowledge the good relations between his department and the Committee on Petitions . #% I want to name two people who have been very much involved . #% If we dare to believe that animals are sentient beings , it is also the case that we have added to the sum of animal happiness as well . #% We could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package . #% It is only adding an EU dimension . #% It found no evidence of any payments that were not authorised . #% That certainly is a call to action . #% Some , such as Mr Farage , want to listen only to some of the people , those who voted ` No ' in France and the Netherlands . #% The OSCE 's field missions in countries like Georgia and Moldova are contributing significantly to stabilising societies traumatised by recent disputes and frozen conflicts . #% I would very much appreciate your advice on how we can support the original Amendment No 394 . #% Mr President , as Commissioner Mandelson knows , increased trade and prosperity go together . #% However , the fact that MEPs ' involvement in the Cotonou Agreement is limited to the assent procedure is frustrating , especially as we take on new areas of scrutiny under the Development Cooperation Instrument . #% A report by Anti-Slavery International found that 95 % of the child domestics were girls . #% I congratulate the Commissioner for making that clear and destroying some of the myths that have been bandied about . #% I deal with many of their problems . #% Progress here has been relatively swift ; the Commission proposal submitted 15 months ago has now gone through every stage , with all of the three parts which make up the triangle of forces involved now having made their own distinctive contributions . #% We will be able to act more decisively to manage our borders and immigration and to tackle serious crime , as our citizens want us to do . #% There are daily troubles in Zimbabwe , food and fuel are increasingly in short supply , inflation is running at 50 % a month , and consumer prices will rise by 300 % at least in the next few months . #% Mr Zapatero seems keen to cosy up to Castro , aided and abetted -- shamefully -- by the British , Italian and French Governments , which have decided to try to change the tough policy of ostracising the Castro regime and regularly inviting Cuban dissidents to EU embassy functions . #% You have talked much in recent times about Africa and I know you are very proud of the fact that the aid that will be going to Africa is going up in value . #% This question was submitted by me on behalf of Parliament 's Committee on Transport and Tourism , as Members had become very concerned over the summer months by the collapse of SkyEurope airline , and approached me to take this initiative on their behalf . #% Sometimes it is by withdrawing action , by sunset clauses , by reviews , and it is always by checking the small print of the proposals . #% So as we move to a vote I am sure that this House will do what it always does and rubber-stamp the decision already made by the committee . #% I am very pleased that the compromise text requires electricity and gas customers to be provided with individual meters that accurately reflect their actual energy consumption and give information on the time of use . #% The EU has a key responsibility , for example , in promoting access to education for all , especially girls . #% Instead of accepting that ` no ' means ` no ' , the political elite have deluded themselves that the French and Dutch people did not base their ` no ' votes on sensible and educated grounds . #% The CAP is as unreformed as ever and rules , regulations and directives have increased , not decreased . #% In terms of her work , I should like to stress the importance of 3G companies and technologies being soundly managed and well run . #% The case for the EU to do less and do it better has never been clearer or more pressing . #% I want to see our cap tightened . #% Finally , in his speech last Friday in Barbados , the President of St Lucia said : ' bananas are to the Caribbean what cars are to Detroit ' . #% Mr President , I should just like to say - and I am sure in this respect I speak on behalf of all members of the committee who asked questions today - that whilst we might all agree with Commissioner Monti that he gave a comprehensive reply , it was a reply to almost everything except the specific questions that Members asked . #% However , as Mrs Guy-Quint mentioned , the House should take account of the fact - as a table I am also circulating today demonstrates - that recent proposals made by institutions other than the Commission would have the effect of significantly increasing the forecast rates of growth of expenditure on personnel and administration under Heading 5 . #% So , let us have a cost-benefit assessment by all means , but let us take all of the costs and all of the benefits into account , not just narrow financial ones . #% The three institutions must develop laws that are easy to understand and enforce and achieve their stated objectives without detrimental side effects . #% Secondly , however , I was concerned not to hear the President-in-Office say that , as part of resolving this situation , we have to guarantee the rights of Serbs who live in Kosovo . #% Of course my view -- our view in UKIP and most of us here on this side of the House -- is that we would much rather see a common market . #% I would like to advise the House that the Commission can not accept the two amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets for two reasons . #% How far do you intervene politically in issues of media concentration in areas that , as the Commissioner pointed out very clearly , cut across a whole range of other weapons the Commission has at its disposal to regulate monopoly power , a word that has been freely bandied around this Chamber this evening ? #% Mr President , I welcome the report by Mr Rod and I agree with him that the renewal of the framework agreement governing cooperation between the EU and ACP States is best considered against the backdrop of the challenges posed by globalisation , economic liberalisation and the European Commission 's reform of external assistance . #% LIFE + will take this forward and this report will help that process . #% I mean no disrespect whatsoever to Commissioner Monti , but Commissioner Byrne has been the honest broker in this terrible dispute from day one . #% We do not seem to understand how it works . #% It is true to say that in the past the airlines have been woefully neglecting passengers ' health . #% Lead is toxic when ingested as a compound , but no one would suggest that it is risky to be in a room which has PVC windows , this is an inert substance . #% I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign ? #% 
The big question for the European Commission was whether it should have absorbed the revised STCW Convention lock , stock and barrel , or whether it should pick , piecemeal , the best revised elements . #% But having said that , while my Group can live with the directive on mobile air-conditioning -- although in our view it is still too weak -- we can not accept the results of the conciliation on the regulation on F-gases , in spite of Mrs Doyle 's good offices to try to get a better deal , but which ultimately failed . #% · while we strongly support a ban on the horrendous exploitation and abuse of children as child soldiers , we can not support a ban on the recruitment of soldiers aged under 18 in our own countries ( paragraph 183 ) ; #% Those posts will be merged into a single position . #% However , at the end of our discussions in committee , I felt that despite these qualities he really did not have anything new to say about the euro . #% Baroness Ashton was chosen through a back-room deal among Europe 's socialist parties , an afterthought by the British Prime Minister . #% We fundamentally support the idea of issuer choice . #% What are the real needs of the Commission ? #% Herbal remedies are bought and trusted by millions and by many of us here . #% In addition , and crucially , he has reneged on a promise to the British people not to undermine their budget rebate , a promise that perhaps he should not have made . #% That is particularly important , especially given recent criticism by the UNHCR of certain parties in my own Member State for their encouragement of such negative views or their failure to challenge them - criticism which is fully justified in my view . #% Finally Mr President , the Icelandic volcano highlighted one major thing : it has strengthened the argument for a Single European Sky better than any politician could have done . #% As for the rest of his rantings , they were as incomprehensible to me as they were to everybody else , and I notice that he has not bothered to stay for the rest of the debate . #% I , and I am sure my colleagues , in particular the rapporteur , consider this is a quite unacceptable way of planning our business as a serious parliament on this most important subject . #% Most of the matters relating to the post have already been laid down in Council Regulation ( EC ) No 45/2001 and published in the Official Journal . #% It must be sensible to allow those who wish to work , train or acquire an education to do so . #% We are conscious of the difference of opportunity that exists between our ACP colleagues and ourselves . #% We should not be encouraging this approach . #% As I previously emphasised to the House , and Mr Harbour has repeatedly and in my view rightly emphasised too , the Commission is aware of the need to sustain the momentum of change , not only in the interests of the institution but also in the interests of our personnel and of the public which we serve . #% We have looked at the implementation figures and we will continue to look at them in the future and use them for future amendments to the budget . #% It should not be any surprise to outside observers , or those in the system , that as Parliament has become more authoritative in ensuring the democratic accountability of the institutions , it will not be simply fobbed off with a lack of reply to questions which have been asked , however far they go back into the past . #% But , above all , they said : we look to the European Union to confront the USA on Third World issues . #% I thank all of you for the excellent work done here . #% I say to Commissioner Byrne : be careful . #% This essentially is an elaborate democratic fig-leaf and we are all part of a charade . #% Perhaps we need to refine our act for next time . #% I can not resist pointing out , Mr President , that we do not yet have computers or Internet access in this splendid building . #% They seem to be spread like confetti around the Member States , more to ensure that each Member State has an agency on its territory than with a view to the need and benefits of having a separate EU agency to deal with the matter in question . #% It will produce a single document with recommendations , not just listing every single option that anybody can think of . #% Mr President , like my colleague , Mr Hallam , I should to thank Mr Gillis for his report and welcome the fact that we are making this decision on the level of set-aside for certain crops well in advance . #% We therefore need a sounder basis for globalisation . #% I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth : the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity , innovation enterprise , the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens . #% We took a while to persuade him to act . #% Now is the time for delivery . #% His programme Dolls , based on Britain 's Spitting Image , satirises the President , something which supposedly causes him great irritation . #% That the other Member States agreed to this in Copenhagen was hard to believe , but for this now to be endorsed in the Treaty is just a step too far . #% The role of the rapporteur will be enhanced : the rapporteur will present the committee 's report which is in response to the Commission 's legislative proposal , immediately stating what the Parliament thinks of the Commission proposal , and will wrap up the debate at the end , perhaps answering the points that different Members have made in the way that I attempted to do just now in our previous debate . #% In those circumstances , how much longer can we continue with this state of affairs in which there is real uncertainty for all concerned ? #% It is up to you to make sure that the exit doors are all closed . #% By making it easier to prosecute people for racist offences , religious and racist intolerance could be significantly diminished . #% Madame President , our purposes are to write a charter that is so good that Member States will find it shameful to refuse to accept it within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice . #% At this stage the European Union should not be self-interested , trying to promote some role for itself , but balanced , positive and constructive . #% In December 2002 , the Scientific Committee on Food , in cooperation with the French and British food authorities , concluded that there is no reason to adjust the approval of aspartame in any way . #% But for quick and easy reference , I draw his attention to the set of tables that he will have in his office today or at the very latest tomorrow - I suspect that they are there today - which will give him complete and up-to-date details on each of the aspects of reform relating to the establishment , development and operation , for instance , of the internal audit service . #% But , as has been said before by many speakers , we must understand the way in which the interinstitutional crisis of the last few months has altered in some fundamental way the relationship between our two institutions . #% More disturbing , however , are the atrocious conditions that these immigrants suffer on their journey on trucks and lorries . #% Quite rightly so , because this legislation , along with the other points mentioned in this debate , provides us with a tremendous opportunity to lead the world in the regulation and authorisations of chemicals , and to influence what goes on not only within the European Union , but also beyond our borders with other chemical producers across the world . #% I can guarantee to every Member in this House that the negative effects will be mirrored in other Member States as well . #% I have asked the Commission to address this situation . #% He is right , but with the addition of ten or twelve more countries in the pipeline , I shudder to think of the possibilities in this area if we do not act and do not succeed in getting legislation that works - legislation that will make the European Union safe and secure for all its citizens , children and parents alike . #% Will it be changed and when ? #% It should be stated here that the Council 's Legal Service has confirmed the principle of using Article 235 to achieve Treaty objectives where there is no specific legal base . #% It must take its neighbours with it . #% This is the very least it should be expected to do . #% Likewise , continued practice in Europe 's protectionist systems will mean defeat in the most competitive matches played away on hostile , global playing fields . #% The fear that we have to combat , for those of us intent on seeing Turkey join the European Union , is the misplaced fear amongst some of the majority population that , in a multi-ethnic country , what we call minority rights are a threat to the unity of the state . #% It must be easy and user-friendly for SMEs ; it must give them a badge of honour to conduct their business under this optional contract and there must be no detriment to national law . #% Well , hot off the press , folks : Aer Lingus have laid people off today and Intel , the people who put EUR 400 000 into the ` yes ' campaign , have laid off 300 people today . #% What we felt at the G90 meeting this morning -- and Commissioner Mandelson will confirm this -- was a terrific sense of anger and , indeed , of betrayal . #% Our challenge is to encourage reformists and moderate interlocutors amongst the Palestinians . #% Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić are still renegades from justice and must be handed in . #% The EU has a human rights duty and competence to make all different , all equal , a reality . #% Mr President , this is a very useful and important revision of the 1976 Directive . #% It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster . #% The pact applies to all EU Member States but the legal penalties are only applicable to those states in the euro zone : that is at the heart of our reservations about this report . #% -- Mr President , from the interpretation which came through , you were in fact reading out the Socialist amendment rather than the PPE-DE one . #% 
If that is not achieved now , these victims of social exclusion will be left out altogether for all time . #% I particularly want to draw attention to some things that are in the compromise and some things that , quite properly , are no longer there . #% Will it lead to corpus juris ? #% We should not , however , lose sight of the fact that there is a huge convergence of international opinion as violence increases , which we need to build on . #% It seems to have been designed by the Albanian leadership that they join the OIC in order to attract Middle Eastern money , rather than based on any strong religious convictions , but , of course , this could all change in the future . #% You are using the crisis as a massive power grab to take us towards fiscal union . #% We must act more strongly against the various third countries that irresponsibly encourage those activities . #% Mr President , I welcome the proposals to ban the production of mechanically recovered meat from all ruminant bones of all ages . #% The guarantees offered by the Commission have been built up over time and they now mean procedural arrangements , which ensure registration of the complaint , strict confidentiality and information for complainants who may make their views known before any decision is taken to close the case . #% The amendments before the House allow for the flexibility required to pursue the exciting new medium of technology , as does the text . #% Now those women who have been successful will sit in a boardroom and people will look across that boardroom and say , are you a token woman or did you get there because you know your business ? #% Therefore Mr Miranda ' s interpretation of what we should vote on is absolutely correct and I totally support him , but this is not a question of a further amendment . #% I am all for us having the opportunity to work in each other 's countries , but to have an open-door immigration policy between countries with differing GDPs is madness . #% Similarly , the doubtful observation that percentage rates of public expenditure were unacceptably too high , was only half-heartedly qualified by Mr Lamfalussy when he came under fire in Parliament 's Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs recently . #% I finish by thanking all those who have contributed to the communication and to the publication of this report and have worked so hard to take EU health policies to this stage from where we can look forward confidently to the road ahead . #% However , there are a number of people in the EU - not least the three million people in the UK who currently take advantage of the opt-out - who will be looking for a commitment from him that , during an economic downturn , his Commission does not want to make it harder for people to work . #% I am interested in them , because as we develop areas in which the Court of Justice will have competence , we have to look at it in the relationship that it bears to the courts of the nation states in Europe and the competences that they carry in particular areas as well . #% That can not be good for democracy and it undermines the trust we need from the people to carry out our responsibilities . #% My question is , what can do ? #% The Commissioner may shake his head and smile , but does he want to have to explain to a government agency or some other agency why he has chosen to opt in ? #% For example , non-governmental organisations are themselves not immune from criticism . #% Madam President , the argument that the anti-terrorism measures and the European arrest warrant do not skimp on fundamental rights , is only sustainable if the protection system of the European Convention on Human Rights for defendants is adhered to in practice . #% Not to take such an approach would be short-sighted , as others have already pointed out . #% I have asked the British Foreign Secretary and President-in-Office of the Council , Jack Straw , to urge President Mbeki , who is at Gleneagles today , to condemn Mugabe and to use every means at his disposal to bring about change for the better in Zimbabwe . #% There are very convincing rumours coming from Burma that 2 , 000 of the thugs who beat up the car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in last weekend are planning to storm her compound and the house where she lives this weekend . #% Furthermore , no layman , nor many MEPs , really understand how the whole thing works . #% We hope it will be of high quality - even if we could not quite get that into the final text - and help engender a sense of mutual confidence and support . #% Part of the problem - I say this particularly to the Commissioner because I know he is sympathetic to this - is that despite the fact that the single market is at the centre of economic reform of the Lisbon goals , when a simple proposal for reform is put forward we are in the extraordinary position that a significant number of Member States oppose it and , indeed , Members seek to change and dilute it . #% I have visited many countries to see what is going on . #% Well , the whole of the European common foreign policy and the planned European army is not worth the bones of one single British serviceman or woman . #% We no longer live in a post-war Europe where food security was a legitimate concern . #% Would you please carry that concern back to the Presidency of Parliament . #% The process must be evidence-based , impact-assessed and with full parliamentary involvement , and on that basis , as I have said , the time for talking is over and we need to move forward . #% Even in Iran , there has been no stoning for almost two years now , with the most senior judge recently declaring the punishment illegal . #% Under Article 276 ( 2 ) , the EC Treaty requires the Commission to submit to Parliament any necessary information on the execution of expenditure and operation of the financial control systems . #% We have this triptych here neatly from Ms Evans : replacement , reduction and scaling down . #% We must get these points across and make sure that we have multilateral discussions with EU involvement . #% Instead of threatening the United Kingdom rebate , what we ought to be concentrating all our efforts on doing is mitigating the necessity for the United Kingdom to have such a rebate . #% Therefore we thoroughly endorse the involvement of regional advisory councils in decisions on technical measures and we hope for the speedy establishment of such councils . #% We must support the Commissioner in his determined attempts to protest and , if necessary , retaliate - but carefully . #% It therefore seems to me that an early review is going to be extremely necessary . #% The problem is that , as amended , the proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs does not achieve the sort of flexibility that its advocates , the Commission and the rapporteur , were claiming . #% I commend the work that Commissioner Vitorino has been doing in moving towards a common European policy on asylum . #% The excuses have to end . #% A number of proposals are put forward but for me the problem with this report is its main thesis that congestion can just be solved with the liberalisation of the air traffic management and control system . #% I understand that in some of the national action plans that were presented this year equality of opportunity for women was given a lower priority than the other three pillars . #% Perhaps there is a need to go a little further in establishing the points you have made . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , Commissioner Malmström was , of course , herself a good friend of Taiwan in her MEP days . #% If those are the principles of socialism and liberalism , they are deeply undesirable in this place . #% We welcome the wider access recommended for all forms of healthcare , particularly psychological support for victims of torture and others who have undergone severe trauma . #% It is alarming to see the Bush Administration pursuing its anti-ICC campaign to such lengths as to cut off military assistance to its allies in the war against terrorism . #% Only today we have heard that the Commission has declared that what seems to be an eminently sensible arrangement in Scotland concerning quotas , is not compatible with common market rules . #% We do not allow people to drink and drive because their coordination is gone . #% Therefore , with 25 Member States from 1 May , 21 languages , no post-2006 financial perspective in view until 2005 at the earliest , and doubts about whether a Constitutional Treaty will be agreed and ratified , the most sensible thing would be to say that there is real uncertainty in the Union 's current political situation , and to be extremely cautious before giving Turkey the green light at this stage . #% The advantage of this system is not only that it will help save lives but also that it will reduce congestion time and contribute to the efficiency of road transportation in Europe with a reduction of external costs . #% The real challenge for this presidency , of course , is to deliver enlargement , and the difficulties that remain should not be underestimated . #% Why did it do that ? #% They take a European law and when they transpose it into national law , they add things which have been sitting in a drawer in a ministry . #% If that were to happen , the European Union could move much further forward without necessarily having any of the grand plans that some people have outlined in this debate . #% In response to these approaches , I should like to make the following points . #% In this multi-million euro budget , Miss Gill has sought to frustrate this modest and comparatively inexpensive scheme at every opportunity . #% It talks of the importance of health and safety at work , of the need to strengthen the prevention culture and to secure a better application of existing law . #% It has added modestly to the sum total of human happiness as well . #% These new technologies need to make use of radio spectrum , but the quantity of radio spectrum will always be limited simply by the laws of physics , so we have to find ways of making sure that this precious resource is used as efficiently as possible . #% Following on from that , I think the reason my colleague said what she did was because the UK Presidency seems to view this as a security and stability issue rather than a human rights issue . #% I believed this would be replaced by democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law . #%
