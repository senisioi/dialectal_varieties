The one thing we have agreed upon is that we are not going back down the route of prophylactic vaccination . #% So most of these questions are very much in their embryonic stages and have not reached the stage where the Council has considered them . #% I say this to them as a passionate `` yes '' voter , because they are causing more damage with the post-Nice referendum signals they are sending than with any pre-Nice referendum signals they sent in Ireland . #% We have to remind all the peoples of Europe that our best self-interest , as well as our best collective interest , lies in understanding our interdependency , not only in relation to single market economics , but also to our human responsibilities to each other across the European continent . #% Despite the complexity of the problem let us keep in mind the whole time what we want at the end . #% As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development I fully support the scheme , both now and in the future . #% I would suggest that we need to take the notion of ` intelligence ' in its broadest sense . #% We need to find a pragmatic way of moving forward to ensure that we get clarity and an assertion of the principle you have outlined here today : that when it comes to a conflict between the right of the citizen to public services and the market , that is set down in legislation . #% Here too the new Commission - and in particular , Commissioner Patten - deserve to be congratulated , first of all for revealing to us the extent of the horror that much of the policy had become . #% While I strongly support China 's admission to the WTO , we should give China a dose of its own medicine . #% Given the globalisation of industry and services , international labour standards are the basis for guaranteeing that the growth of the global economy can benefit all . #% The examples cited by many speakers here are very relevant and it is important for us to remember that we must give real meaning to vocational training , that is to give people the skills they require to be able to take up the new opportunities that arise . #% I suggest that we should consider appointing a political envoy from the European Union to Iraq to see if we can broker some sort of peace , between the United Nations and Iraq , because the sanctions are genocidal in their effect . #% This is the EU that we will work towards . #% Can Council confirm that this is so and , if not , what proposals does it have to include children in Maastricht Two as a matter of urgency , so that there is a basis for common action ? #% We now need to work in earnest to begin the programme of reform for 1999 . #% I do not want to point the finger at any particular country , but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom . #% Yes , Saddam Hussein has ruled Iraq with an iron fist , he is an evil dictator . #% Such permitted assistance as there is in that response , is for many regions , particularly in the United Kingdom , likely to be more theoretical than real because of national governments ' resistance to match funding or any form of state aid . #% On Friday we received the very tragic news that he had been executed . #% There has been empirical evidence to prove that reducing business taxation , reducing the cost of labour , increases employment opportunities , increases real jobs with real incomes and also can lead to greater social benefits because of increased taxation delivery . #% Let us give credit where credit is due : Mr Barroso has moved , he has brought forward new initiatives and new policies . #% This is only correct and proper in the light of the fact that 11 countries out of the 15 are participating within a common , single European currency regime . #% We must also ask for effective coordination between the GÃ¡rdai , the revenue commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare . #% in writing . - In this era of commercialisation and professionalism , agents are unavoidable aspects of the sporting landscape . #% This was the case in the seventies and eighties but it is no longer with our screening and sterilisation process . #% That said , however , we believe that the exercise just completed has been a positive and valuable exercise . #% The collapse of the market and the collapse of consumer confidence due to BSE has caused a huge income drop for farmers . #% I do not think anything the Irish presidency did halted efforts to make the European Union a military superpower or to stop the widening of the gap between rich and poor , which is the likely outcome of EMU . #% We must put pressure on these governments to make sure that they do not allow this to happen . #% REACH can provide that guarantee and information , but we must be careful not to destroy these industries as well . #% My group supports the resolution . #% I hope that has now changed . #% We would urge the UK authorities to take on board all of our recommendations : apologise , yes , but also compensate those who were so severely affected . #% Electronic business is now one of the more significant drivers of both successful business development and national economic development . #% Hopefully , in the days ahead , we can redouble our political and diplomatic efforts in order to ensure the restoration of a balanced and fair competitive situation . #% That is something that will live with me for a long time . #% My Group will vote for censure . #% We must remember , as Europe integrates more closely , that it is very important that we seek to protect and promote our different cultural and linguistic diversities within the EU itself . #% Political lessons should be learnt from this , but they must take second place to Europe offering whatever aid is needed and whatever aid is requested by the United States to assist the people concerned . #% I am concerned that it could be used by some of the scientists and others as an opportunity to curb TACs and quotas when there is disagreement between fishermen and the scientists . #% -- Commissioner , could you address the issue of caged beds in Romania ? #% Thank you for all the work you have done on our behalf . #% I hope that the ratification of the Nice Treaty proceeds successfully , and that when we revisit the issue in Ireland , we will have a different result . #% One has to really ask the question : who is the American Government really out to save ? #% There is a good home rating scheme developed in my own constituency which should be far more widespread . #% Pro-democracy campaigners and political activists are often detained without charge and , in some cases , charged with inciting subversion . #% The Kyoto Protocol is off life support because the Russian Federation ratified it . #% I believe that this will have an impact on the convergence objectives of the funds . #% Over-regulation , however , leads to unnecessary stifling of the sector , resulting in a lack of variety , and ignores the indigenous range of high-quality regional and national food products . #% For example , subject to overall budget constraints , we believe taxation on the lower paid should be reduced . #% If there had been a check with cards , maybe we could have avoided the problem of having a head count . #% Mr President , about 20 years ago I was talking to an elderly gentleman about the generation gap . #% While I do not agree with the policy of the US - a policy of no aid without trade - it is essential that we remain rigorous and firm with our policy of no aid without linkage to democracy , human rights and freedom . #% We in this Parliament support your efforts to restore credibility to the peace process and indeed to the political process . #% This must change ! #% I support the Environment Committee 's rejection of the proposed quality category being ` sufficient ' rather than proper . #% They also have concerns , which I would share , about the very severe penalties which Member States might impose on them for breaches of the regulations that are not deliberate . #% We , in the Parliament , must follow this issue along with Mr Lamy and other Commissioners until we get something that is appropriate to the age which we are moving into . #% It is our duty as one human being to another , but what we must absolutely insist on in all our immigration policies , not just in the context of mass displacements of people in the event of civil war , is that we must have a much better thought-out , much more humane and generous , and , above all , merciful policy towards those who come to us for help in these tragic situations . #% I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety , Mr Byrne . #% Unfortunately , surveys show that at this stage more than half of European citizens are opposed to the release and marketing of genetically modified foods . #% However , I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right , this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge , a quota per household for drinking , cooking and sanitation . #% We have had freedom of movement for the Irish soccer team as regards Britain for a long number of years now . #% Such drove me to vote against the resolution . #% The general took over in a coup . #% 
New mechanisms might need to be put into place . #% Congratulations again to both rapporteurs . #% Finally , an important element of this debate should be the future of EU production . #% If I may say so , the Irish cinema is 100 years old this year and our recent experience has been very beneficial . #% Nowhere is there the same positive commitment to environmental management as in my own country . #% Not only does this cause problems for commuters and tourists in reaching the west and north-west , it also makes it very difficult to access those regions . #% Parliament essentially exercises its competences in the policy domain at three levels : determination of political priorities -- which means codecision at policy-setting level , monitoring implementation , and budgetary powers . #% Discussions were based on the debate about what happened in the North Sea . #% However , I want to concentrate on just one area where we can act , and that is the low-level presence of unauthorised GMOs in feed imports and its impact on the EU feed industry , because this is an over-arching issue . #% The Commission is consulted and the Council must agree to the statute . #% In most respects the European Union has lived up to the ideals and aspirations of Europe 's founding fathers . #% However , taxation is solely a national interest issue . #% Quite obviously the profitable areas are needed to support the non-profitable areas , otherwise the postal system , as we know it , collapses . #% The third area concerns the impact that conflict situations have on women and children , leading to tragic consequences on a regular basis . #% Finally my main question , Commissioner , is : who decides ? #% To introduce degressivity to support - at least in Ireland 's case - a new dairy com ( i.e. common organisation of market ) , i.e. coupled payments for the milk sector , is illogical , given the gospel of decoupling underpinning the mid-term review . #% . Mr President , I would simply like to point out that my report is the last report from the Committee on Fisheries to this House during the present mandate . #% The old saying ` give a man a fish , you feed him for a day ; teach a man to fish , you feed him for life ' is a very wise one . #% There was no way out of it ; we had to face reality . #% I take it from the Commissioner 's response that basically , if letters of formal notice have been sent out and no subsequent legal action has been taken , citizens in Ireland who want copies of letters sent to the Irish Government can in fact get them . #% I do not agree with a harmonised tax system or with - as Mr Berthu said - many of the harmonisations that are going on within the EU . #% In particular : the patenting of the human genome ; human cloning in its various forms ; the manipulation and modification of the human germ line - which is a particular concern - and the creation and use of human embryos in research . #% As most Members will know , when Sweden privatized and introduced competition before their entry into the European Union , it allowed the previous state monopoly to undercut the new competitors and then buy them out . #% The composition of the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur has maintained this balance between rightholders and users effectively . #% It is our duty to put citizens ' interests first and not the interests of industry or chemicals companies . #% The Nice Treaty makes no change to the emerging Irish and European security architecture but it is the crucial next step to heal the historic divisions of Europe caused by war and destruction . #% In terms of the cohesion report , I would like to point to the need for an ongoing evaluation of how other Community policies are supporting the objective of economic and social cohesion . #% I hope that the presidency will bring it to the attention of his colleague , the Irish minister for public enterprise , Mary O'Rourke , and to try to force her to take the needs of disabled people into account in all EU funds expenditure . #% Mr President , I totally disagree with Mr Schulz with regard to what Commissioner McCreevy did or did not say , because if you read the 16 different press reports on the incident in Sweden , none of it was related to the Swedish social model . #% They should also have the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law , have access to legal representation and have the right either to be charged or released . #% in writing . - As a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and a committed environmental campaigner , I expected a Dess report which would represent a CAP for the carbon era - one based upon environmental incentives , resource management , and a strong investment in the wider environmental issues facing the EU . #% I would point out that , in the past , the individual states and kingdoms which now compose the European Union persecuted and tried to stamp out these minorities , but the European Union now supports them and gives them practical assistance in the form of a budget and , in the case of Ireland , a minority language office in Dublin . #% Can I ask Mr Prodi whether in principle , subject to Parliament and the Commission being able to formalise appropriate arrangements , it would be possible to do this regularly ? #% Mr President , I wish to draw your attention to what I term a silent invasion of Europe by an alien species , , otherwise known as the American grey squirrel . #% If the Council insists there is a limit , we have to insist that it is 1.27 % . #% However , it must not get bogged down debating institutional points concerning relationships , for example between NATO/WEU , and the national idiosyncrasies of some Member States relating to their security obligations . #% Why is it always too little , too late ? #% I would like to conclude by saying that I condemn the recent and ongoing violence in the Middle East and any acts of anti-Semitism which have been and are being committed in Europe or elsewhere in the world . #% There seems to be remarkable consensus in the House today but I would like to make a few points . #% If someone from another planet saw us acting as if we had known that , they would think we were stupid . #% The Vienna Summit will review the claims of other applicant states . #% Please ensure that aid from the EU , and indeed American aid , is used as it should be used , not to increase the attacks by the militia against the peace communities in the name of trying to take out the guerrillas . #% The full definition of the Prodi project properly should await the new parliamentary mandate and the nomination of the new Commission . #% Its approach - to state ` this far and no further ' - moves it closer to the British position on Europe , which places more emphasis on a free trade area rather than pursuing political union . #% We got into the mess we are in because people were on automatic . #% Goods do flow freely from these territories , goods produced in Israeli settlements in the occupied territories . #% The dissemination of information about the range of marine pollution threats - hydrocarbons , radioactive substances and other harmful substances - will serve to ensure that the best possible mitigation measures are in place and have the full public trust and confidence of the public . #% I very much welcome the proposal on the table today for common rules in the field of civil aviation . #% It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner . #% It is our job to respond and ensure that our legislative framework in the EU can deliver competition and consumer benefits . #% A lasting solution must be a political one . #% I am particularly supportive of paragraph 13 of Mrs Smet 's report which urges that refugee status be given to those women who are threatened with the kind of violence that has already been outlined here . #% Although it has always maintained that it only provided the Khmer Rouge with technical expertise in agriculture , the Cambodian documentation centre recently unearthed evidence to show that it was directly involved in the setting up of the interrogation and torture centre in Phnom Penh where thousands of Cambodians died . #% As others have already mentioned , it is not a perfect solution , but it is necessary at this time . #% The model for decision-making within the Union dates back , in part , to when the European Economic Community was a six-Member organisation in the late 1950s . #% There is a pressing need , in my view , for the introduction of international legislation to bring the perpetrators of child sex abuse to justice . #% I would have preferred to hear the Commissioner plan for what consumption will be for the next three or four years and take immediate measures to reduce production . #% Mrs Rothe and Mrs Graenitz are quite right to point out that many other policies are taken up by renewable energy , and there is a whole list : environment , agriculture , regional , transport , etcetera . #% However , this should only be the first step to deal with it , both at European and international level . #% I hope it is defeated because then in the longer term you will come back with a proposal that represents the common sense view of everyone in this European Union , and not just those with purist ideals who do not have to face the consequences of imposing their ideals on others . #% Unemployment still remains at over 9 % within the European Union which is unacceptably high . #% The British Presidency proposal does not make adequate provision for the enlargement of Romania and Bulgaria and we can only hope that the talks will change that situation . #% I have three points to make in this debate . #% Mr President , yesterday we heard the presidency of the European Union fudge on the issue of Iraq and Turkey . #% With citizens seeking less Europe , this House and our guest today arrogantly demand more Europe , more EU competences , more majority voting , more centralisation , more and more and more ! #% This is the future direction that Pakistan needs to take . #% 
I hope that the Council of Ministers is intending to act rationally . #% Under this regulation , for example , the trimmings on collars will be labelled clearly and separately from the rest of the garment , allowing consumers to make an informed choice about the clothes they buy . #% I believe that the guidelines offer the flexibility that Member States need in order to draw up those programmes . #% As a public representative for the east coast of Ireland , I am at all times conscious of the threat posed to my constituents and our environment from nuclear installations on the other side of the Irish Sea , in particular the outdated , decrepit and accident-prone Sellafield plant in Cumbria . #% Mr President , before I start I should like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council , Minister Fitzgerald , to the House . #% Nobody ever thought that the poor old cows or sows or whatever were really being taken seriously . #% Disclosing exact percentages for animal feedingstuffs goes beyond the equivalent provisions applicable to food for human consumption . #% in writing . - Mr Hegyi 's own-initiative report emphasises the importance of the protection of wilderness areas in Europe in the application of existing Directives , proposing a definition of ` wilderness ' as still untouched areas as well as ` areas where human activities are minimal ' . #% I believe that the utmost respect must be paid to the need for social , economic , regional cohesion , and that the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of regions highly dependent on fisheries . #% We are being misled at the moment on the whole question of the size of the budget . #% In particular , the respect for diversity that will be required in the European Union of the 21st century is encompassed by the portfolio that Commissioner Orban will have , and I call on all colleagues to be as generous as possible towards him , and to all the Commissioners , but in particular to be helpful towards him in suggesting new ways in which that diversity can be protected within the European Union . #% It is important that the voice of the people 's branch of the European Union is heard on such an important topic . #% We should condemn these sort of acts outside the European Union as well as inside . #% Mr President , my group supports the Commission 's proposals . #% Any proposal that corporate tax be paid by SEs and could go into EU coffers is totally unacceptable . #% I welcome the fact that the present regional aid guidelines , as they affect my constituency of Northern Ireland , are a marked improvement from earlier drafts , and that the Commission has listened to representations from myself and others . #% It is very important that this day should not go by without our acknowledging this initiative . #% As friends , we should be allowed to ask questions . #% I have been taken aback by the willingness of fellow MEPs , at times , to give other institutions carte blanche in this important area , so long as some little interest of theirs or influence was not lost . #% However , the most important area which has been outlined during the Austrian Presidency has been one of realism , of doing things that are achievable , of not ignoring problems that are there and trying to build a consensus to try and solve them , as well as taking the sensible attitude that this can not be solved just in six months . #% The good news is that it used to be 34 000 . #% We must place emphasis on overall economic growth , but our priority must be to promote employment , more and better jobs in our European Union . #% There has to be two sides , Unita and MPLA , implementing the Lusaka Accords to have a solution in Angola and the tension in the region . #% The promises made must be kept . #% Perhaps that is something that our local authorities should look at : whether or not forestry schemes should require planning approval . #% The temporary committee and the report focus mainly on the threat to European industrial competition and the threat posed by industrial espionage . #% As far as research is concerned , and after very many long discussions with Mr Bourlanges , I am interested to know what he intends to do . #% The head of the company was supposed to be arrested and a warrant was issued for his arrest . #% Mr President , I welcome these reports today and their recommendations . #% I call upon the Irish Government to make this a priority for its presidency of the European Union . #% The conclusions on unemployment which are outlined in part 3 of the presidency 's document are more an overview of what is being done at present than a new set of initiatives . #% We must include enablement in all our approaches to development in developing countries . #% The new Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Alaa has international credibility as he is one of the Palestinian negotiators of the 1993 Oslo Accord . #% Despite around half a century of commercial operation of nuclear reactors , the solution to the long-term management of nuclear waste remains unsolved . #% Mr President , I too welcome the McCartney family here this afternoon and offer them my support in their efforts to get justice in the appalling murder of Robert . #% I therefore welcome this report , which should go some way to tackling this problem . #% We have that opportunity through the regional consultation process . #% Because of the failure to establish agreement on the new European Constitution during the previous presidency , their first main task is to reach that agreement . #% I look forward to welcoming him as a member of our group next week . #% The war has always been about controlling oil and in my view little or nothing to do with Kuwait . #% For some time Parliament , the Commission and Member States have sought the introduction of common EU-wide rules to deal with the problems of TSEs such as BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep . #% I would ask you , Mr President , to make the strongest possible protest to the Council to ensure that my question and the other Members ' questions are restored and in fact replied to ; and to make it clear that neither this Council nor any other council is entitled to treat this House with such contempt . #% The other point I want to make is that rail internally , both on the continent of Europe and in Ireland , is important as a public service . #% In my own country of Ireland we have been able to silence the gun and bring communities together that we never thought imaginable . #% Secondly , I welcome what the Commissioner had to say on Cyprus and Kaliningrad . #% The Fund has committed in excess of # 400 million which has triggered an investment of # 1.2 billion creating 38 000 jobs for 150 projects right across the border countries and Northern Ireland . #% May I also take issue with the report 's paragraph 2 : peat is not a wood substitute , it is a fuel/fertiliser in its own right . #% It is a first modest and cautious step in an EU-wide commitment to fight counterfeiting and piracy . #% In committee we tabled an amendment on the increasing problem of fishing vessels flying flags of convenience , which was very narrowly defeated . #% There are minimum standards but it is possible for a Member State to go beyond those standards individually . #% The consumer can not be bound to lose his right to go to court by contracts , as inserted in the report that is before us from the Legal Affairs Committee . #% But I will move on as time is too precious to waste . #% I hope that this great wrong which has been done to Northern Ireland will be put right . #% But the core question is : who is responsible ? #% Mr President , I compliment Mr Bowe on his work in this area . #% What consistency is there at the heart of this policy followed by the Commission ? #% The Council of Ministers has been less helpful , if not obdurate , in its approach . #% However , whilst there is a strong international commitment to revise the Basel framework , it is crucially important that such revision strikes the right balance between various business models , investment and traditional retail banking , different legal forms and predominant financing of the corporate sector through bank lending in Europe . #% It must be asked where did Saddam Hussein get the weapons from before the Gulf War and where is he supposed to be getting them from now ? #% I do not want English-speaking people who look at this amendment to think for one second that I voted for that . #% I want to focus on improving better regulation for the internal market and ensuring that we achieve a sense of purpose in our law-making for consumers in the internal market . #% To come back to the issue of dumping vessels discarded within the European Union on other countries , we have to be very careful that we are not dumping unsafe and ecologically unsound vessels on countries at cheap prices . #% This particularly applies to islands , where it is not simple or easy to get the kind of technology or the kind of expertise that linking up with the nearest major hospital - with a consultant at one end and the local doctor or nurse at the other end - can provide . #% It is just not acceptable to turn a blind eye to the others because of pressure from industry . #% Without his strength and his vision we could never have arrived at where we are today . #% I do not think it has done , and I do not think it did in the past what this Parliament asked it to do in 1990 . #% 
I do not want to oppose the Commission proposal , referred to in the Langenhagen report , to allow industrial fishing to continue in this particular case . #% I am also sorry that the Committee on Budgets did not approve moving the training of the nuclear inspectorate in the former Soviet Union from the external policy to the energy line where that training could be done far more efficiently . #% In fact , these two are the same priority . #% But let us celebrate what has been achieved so far . #% I certainly support every part of the resolution from all the groups concerned . #% I can certainly recommend to the House that the application must take Maltese opinion fully into account . #% Without longterm guarantees I am not sure it is sensible to talk , as the proposal does , of further adapting agriculture to the marketplace because this usually means lower prices and increased costs for the people in rural areas . #% The new regulations being proposed will be a significant step forward . #% I do not question the genuineness of it , but I do question the genuineness of the way in which this Parliament acts on such concerns . #% The use of medicated feed for prophylactic or growth-promotion reasons can not continue to feature in management , as is the case in some feeding systems and in some Member States at present . #% We are supposed to respect the precautionary principle in Europe , especially when we are talking about putting genetically-modified organisms into the environment , considering that , with GM , any resulting adverse effects may be irreversible . #% In the UK it is commonplace that consumers can and do benefit from sales promotions , for example coupon vouchers . #% They should think carefully about the effects on their own electorates who are watching with increasing disenchantment the distant and cumbersome European superstructure . #% The role of legislators and their enactment and enforcement of food and public health regulations are also central to a safe food industry . #% Radioactivity poses grave dangers to health and the environment . #% There is a lot of hypocrisy here . #% This House must support freedom of speech and freedom of media expression . #% However it , together with any new constitutional treaty , will be the Treaty of the EU . #% I should also like to be a little bit nationalistic and say that I am extremely happy that it was during the Irish presidency that the importance of the issue that we are discussing today finally impacted on the political agenda under President Norah Owen , who was the President-in-Office at the time . #% We should encourage further development of this area , in particular for those who are disadvantaged . #% And the chief executives and managers of the multinationals who make the important decisions displaying the callous disregard for the consequences would face the proposal of not only seeing their businesses maybe in some cases closed down because of heavy fines and seizure of assets and so on , but they themselves could face imprisonment . #% Madam President , it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here ! #% The area under afforestation is the size of England and Scotland . #% The Irish Government has already expressed its sentiments in this regard and will be taking appropriate action . #% It is a crucial issue and it will decide whether or not we grow beet this year -- perhaps the last season for beet growing in Ireland . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to congratulate Mr Lechner in the preparation and presentation of his report which my group can support in principle . #% While I welcome the recent undertaking by Monsanto not to commercialise the ` seed termination technology ' , this matter is far too serious to leave to those who are directly involved and who would have acted otherwise in the absence of consumer vigilance . #% In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount . #% Is he aware that his colleague , Mr Cunningham , gave an undertaking to Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that he was prepared to have the matter re-examined ? #% There is one paper recycler , little plastics recycling , no metal recyclers and the only glass recycler in the country has recently closed down . #% The Mitchell principles have clearly laid down the broad parameters for an overall peace agreement . #% Fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve long-term growth . #% This would have jeopardised timetables and led to potential delays for future European programmes . #% As has been said , Ireland relies very heavily on landfill - I think only Greece is more reliant . #% Question Time is this Parliament 's one opportunity to put the Commission in the dock and put questions on issues that affect our constituents . #% We also agree with the rapporteur 's amendments seeking to restrict the derogation for safety to vessels less than 12 metres in length and we would like to thank her for retabling these important amendments . #% It is not enough to agree on a set of rules . #% Could the Commission confirm that the same security standards that are now deemed necessary in Cap de la Hague - that is protection with fighter planes and ground-to-air missiles and a no-fly zone - are in place in Sellafield ? #% What I would suggest is that if we as a Community decide that nets may not be used , then the people who are prevented from engaging in the legitimate practice of catching tuna fish with nets should get compensation . #% In Ireland we seem to think that all the so-called ` better jobs ' are the future and unwisely we starve out family farming . #% However , I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper . #% It was only with great difficulty that diabetes was mentioned in the Sixth Framework Programme . #% Is it ECU 40m , ECU 24m or , as some of my colleagues believe , is it a smaller amount ? #% This directive will have major implications for waste disposal throughout the EU and especially in Ireland where waste management has tended to focus exclusively on landfill . #% I would argue , in total contrast to what Mrs Foster says , that an EU coastguard could effectively police EU waters : it could clamp down on illegal dumping , enforce the common fisheries policy , assist with emergency rescue services and restrict illegal trafficking . #% While registration should generally be on a first-come , first-served principle , we have nonetheless proposed that rightholders , who have prior rights in law and public policy , should have the opportunity to pre-register . #% This , I hope , will have a particular impact on emerging cooperatives in the accession countries and serve also to strengthen the European social model throughout the enlarged Union . #% We talk about action plans for the Third World , especially with regard to children , but we never hear of any detailed plans or exact initiatives in this area . #% The draft revision of the Treaties which was presented to the Dublin Summit by the Intergovernmental Conference represents a solid basis from which to proceed to the final and most controversial stage of the negotiations on a new Treaty . #% This issue should be addressed as a matter of urgency particularly if , as we would all wish , the European Union is to deal with this problem affecting citizens of the Union , and if the required credibility of the Union in the eyes of the people of the Member States is to be won back . #% I have no daylight in my office and it is an appalling insult ! #% Mr President , it is now over fifteen years since the disease we all now know as AIDS came into the public domain . #% With regard to enlargement , it is most important that the European Union and the applicant countries get down to negotiating the more difficult chapters , which to date have remained closed . #% I have one or two concerns that perhaps represent my own views rather than those of my political group . #% In this latter regard , I welcome the fact that since the Israeli forces left southern Lebanon , the region has been very peaceful . #% As the previous speaker said , the British Government has had these implemented perfectly from day one , as it always does , while everybody else lags behind . #% They are showing contempt for the wish and will of the international community as regards the right of people to live in peace , the right of people not to be oppressed , the right of people not to be killed with weapons made by western countries . #% However , greater focus should be placed on solar , wind and water energy , as this can also contribute a great deal towards a final energy plan . #% However , the Environment Committee did give the ferrets a knock and that is where it stands subject to perhaps investigating what my colleague Mr Whitehead has said . #% The challenge for all of us now is to demonstrate to consumers that the British Government has finally become serious about the eradication of BSE and it must now go about the task with commitment and determination . #% A lot has already been said about ` to vaccinate or not to vaccinate ' , be it prophylactic vaccination , ring vaccination , emergency vaccination or contingency vaccination . #% If we have a common European corporate tax regime , we will lose one of the greatest factors in maintaining our economic independence and our current state of prosperity . #% I wish to note also that the Irish Labour Party does not support a CCCTB . #% I should like to refer very briefly to some of the points highlighted . #% Not enough European small and medium-sized enterprises grow into world-beaters . #% As a Catholic , I do not happen to share some of his very strong fundamental views on that matter , but we can agree to differ . #% 
Human rights continue to be abused , political activity is suppressed and , according to Amnesty International , there were more State executions in China last year than in all other countries combined . #% The underlying cause for a large proportion of these crimes is drug dependency and the abuse of illegal drugs . #% Mr President , I should like to comment on the Commission recommendation concerning staging posts when live animals are being transported from one Member State to another within the Union . #% I think this is wrong , it totally runs against the Lisbon Agenda and it is the type of thing we do badly in Europe . #% Mr President , one of the problems with this report and with the idea that the European Parliament and Members of Parliament and political parties should draw up an electoral system is that they are going to have the interests of the political parties themselves rather than the interests of citizens to the fore . #% In relation to the question that the honourable Member has asked , as she will be aware , a joint action is an enabling statutory procedure under the Treaties , specifically the second and third pillars as provided for in the Treaty on European Union . #% Of particular interest are the extension of Community competence in areas of security and safety , and the impact on the sector of Community initiatives such as the Single European Sky and the Air Traffic Management System . #% It is not good enough . #% Clearly the development of renewables is linked to environmental objectives as well as issues of employment , regional development and the promotion of local initiatives . #% Mr President , this is a very worthy report that has been a long time coming through the system . #% In the past , as you know , Parliament and the Council have both essentially duplicated each other 's work to a certain extent by producing similar reports . #% Though there are now 25 Member States , the UK this year will contribute one eighth ( 12.4 % ) of the total budget revenue of # 83 billion required to fund the EU in 2006 . #% Madam President , I have a point of order on the aviation industry in Europe , and in particular the national airline in Ireland which will be bankrupt within a matter of weeks unless the Commission relaxes its guidelines on state aid for the airline industries . #% Parliament does not have legislative powers in the area of criminal law , which is best decided at national level . #% I believe that Mr Jacques Santer is a decent man . #% But there is no equity or fairness when a logbook offence in one country leads to a fine of only EUR 96 , whereas in another country this could lead to the confiscation of boat , catch and gear . #% When the Budgetary Control Committee interviewed Mr Wessberg on 24 May 2011 , MEPs praised his past performance in both the private and public sectors . #% Finally , I ask the media to examine their conscience and ask : why now , why not then ? #% Coming from a small country with a lesser spoken language , I should also like to recognize that , in this context , the small publishers of minority languages are indeed the true heroes of the publishing world . #% My last point is that our legal services have drafted an opinion for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market with regard to the ability of using Article 95 . #% Bearing in mind that we in this House support the peace process , and that together with our international partners we have committed four and half billion dollars to underpin it , and also remembering the importance of bi-partisanship in the Irish peace process , I would ask you , Mr President , to urge the two main parties in Sri Lanka , together with the Tamil Tigers , to support the re-opening of negotiations to ensure that permanent peace is brought to that troubled country . #% On reform , human rights , religious freedom , Cyprus , Armenia we have obtained nothing , but in return we have wasted , and will continue to waste , millions on pre-accession aid . #% The observers from the United States and Australia all concluded that there was no evidence against the men . #% Commissioner Rehn reported this evening that it has succeeded in reducing the cost of doing business by 22 % in some areas and will continue to concentrate on this initiative . #% Madam President , I was here in Parliament when the Chernobyl explosion took place . #% Our hearings also will be fair . #% These reservations aside , I am very glad to be able to say that on this occasion also I recommend a very positive assessment of the Maltese application . #% If this happens Europe will stagnate and eventually fall apart as Member States pursue their own individual aspirations , no longer having a common goal . #% I trust neither national government nor Commission will be found wanting in financially contributing to the great success that venture can be . #% 14 , 000 people live on the nearby island , and if there were to be a major accident , their only point of exit would be a bridge which is only 300 metres from the new plant . #% US Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , is proclaiming that Iraq is giving refuge to al-Qa ` ida terrorists . #% It is clear that the only way of breaking the current deadlock is through the intervention of a third party . #% And of course in the not-so-distant past there was Chernobyl , the memory of which still haunts us . #% I would further like to point out that the derogation for Ireland , Northern Ireland , Greece and Luxembourg only covers those elements of the package where implementation would serve no real and practical purpose . #% I do not believe - and I have to disagree with my colleague - that an intervention shaped in this way will actually increase security . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I thank the rapporteurs for the tremendous amount of work they have done on these reports , coming , as we said in an earlier debate , at a very important time when people are looking for answers and looking for ideas on how to move forward . #% Our resolve and courage at these enlargement negotiations must match those which the candidate countries themselves are showing in enacting wide-ranging new laws as they prepare to join the European Union as full members . #% Women are still portrayed stereotypically even if a few new stereotypes have been added . #% On this count I welcome the maintenance of a clear separation between the two existing regimes for the recognition of professional qualifications : the sectoral regime covering seven regulated professions and a general regime . #% I wish during this debate to take the opportunity of addressing economic growth , in particular in my own country of Ireland . #% In Europe , we are only 23 % self-sufficient in proteins . #% The way forward for rural development is one of vision and confidence ; above all , we must look to the future ! #% That is particularly apparent when we look at the current difficulties concerning the recognition of the euro and the eurozone economy within the United States and in the Far East , and at the constant questioning concerning the enforcement of the rules concerning the Stability and Growth Pact in those areas . #% This is a proposal which is strongly supported by the artisanal fishermen in Senegal . #% Concerns still exist but I believe that Council , Commission and Parliament have struck the right balance between the need to protect public policy and consumers and at the same time promote and support the growth of e-business . #% Our committee , the Industry Committee , questioned three Commissioners and sent delegations to three others . #% I have tabled this question because the new guidelines of the IAEA appear to be designed specifically to accommodate the air transport of MOX fuel and this has not been defined as low-leakage or low-dispersal material , as the Commission itself has stated . #% It is an important European initiative and I hope the College will go for it , notwithstanding some of the sequencing difficulties to do with other negotiations which may arise . #% I welcome the outcome of the conciliation talks and I should particularly like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Corbey , for her excellent work and understanding of the issues . #% Since we have been able to control our fertility , women can now choose to have one child , no children or ten children . #% I would like the Commissioner to address that particular point . #% The fact that it has not been possible to deliver humanitarian aid in any structured manner to people in the Kosovo region does not reflect very well on us in this House . #% We have to thank the Commissioner himself , who has demonstrated commitment and dedication to this issue , and the Council and the Presidency again , which have made all this happen . #% Despite the high profile case of novelist Elif Shafak , which was thrown out of court last week , self-censorship will continue to be forced upon the press until Article 301 is done away with entirely . #% The report refers to the forthcoming impact assessment on the proposed Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base . #% I would commend to the House that we put an end to this matter and recognise and salute the integrity of Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar , his committee and his services . #% Madam President , on a point of order , did you expend the full 20 minutes on oral questions to Commissioner Fischer Boel ? #% It would impose unnecessary bureaucracy on an already highly competitive and successful UK ports market . #% The report has not dealt with serious concerns such as ethics in biotechnology , public health , consumers ' concerns regarding food , and indeed the effects on the environment . #% I would appeal to Members of this House not to pull the plug on an important measure of economic reform . #% The plain truth is also that the EU has failed the textile industry . #% I would like to thank you and join with all our colleagues in expressing our great joy and support for John Hume and David Trimble in the work they are doing in Northern Ireland . #% On our chaotic health system ? #% The danger is that when the EU bureaucracy and red tape get to work , the system that emerges could be unwieldy , excessively burdensome and very expensive . #% We must not forget that the money and the profits that are being made by these companies are coming back into Europe . #% The ordinary people of Colombia live and suffer in an environment of oppression caused not only by these paramilitary and guerrilla groups , but often at the hands of a government which is either unwilling or unable to protect them . #% 
I believe , however , that what is necessary is a simplification of regional policy and the bringing about of economic and social cohesion . #% I am not in a position to comment on the last proposal put forward by the honourable Member , but may I say that the Council of Ministers has been preoccupied not with expelling or allowing countries to leave the Union but with the 12 countries which are knocking on the door wishing to join , so attractive does the Union seem to them . #% Those are the reasons for my question . #% Why do I link that with the budget debate ? #% When we look at what the Council agreed upon in Lisbon and the new European initiative in particular and consider utilising the advantages which would accrue to Europe from the telecommunications revolution , we can see that there are many great opportunities out there to be grasped , but they require proper order , proper rules and proper regulation to ensure their use for the benefit of all . #% It is a question of who represents the law : the drug barons and the murder squads or the police and the justice department or the politicians . #% The one area where I have a slight disagreement with Terry Wynn is over the whole question of export refunds , where I think he went a little bit astray . #% Their livelihood has , up until now , depended on the historic claim his local community held on its coast 's fishing rights . #% We finally got some movement from the Commission on the matter . #% People are losing sight of the point here and putting the cart before the horse . #% As well as that , there is a need for transparency , because commercial confidentiality means this subject will remain secret . #% Madam President , I am deeply appalled by the latest , dangerous escalation of violence in the Middle East which must be ended . #% I would stress the importance of identifying gaps in knowledge and ensuring that any initiatives necessary to fill such gaps are well thought out and capable of delivering the required outcomes . #% in writing . - The EU can not claim to be a single market if obstacles to trade still exist . #% The proper forum for dealing with this issue is the WTO , where the EU must ensure that there is a level playing field . #% Some will have to stay with their boats tied up watching fishermen from other nationalities fish their very shores . #% We are all concerned that civilian populations must be shielded from the attacks which are taking place in Afghanistan at this time and , in a war situation , there is nothing more sickening than one hearing commentators refer to civilian deaths as ` collateral damage ' . #% In that regard , I just want to read out a letter from the State Prosecutor in Belgium : ' In reply to your letter of 10 June 1997 , 020211 , I hereby inform you that a criminal investigation is under way into matters , including the possible misappropriation of funds belonging to Belgian public works contractors which took part in the construction of the European Parliament 's property complex in Brussels D1 , D2 and D3 buildings . #% This presents us with two challenges . #% Mr President , the WTO negotiations on agriculture , combined with the Commission 's proposals for CAP reform , represent fundamental change for European agriculture and the welfare of farm families . #% A European Union-wide identification system for cattle is long overdue . #% He has committed himself to that and I hope he will . #% In particular , I congratulate her and her Government on their tenacity and willingness to be involved in what were considered to be many difficult issues . #% I would ask the Presidency of Parliament to intervene on behalf of these people . #% The EU faces charges of protectionism . #% Finally , without anticipating the future too much , my own group feels sufficiently strongly about this participation that if Parliament was inappropriately excluded or diminished in its institutional role we would consider recommending that it should not give any opinion on an Intergovernmental Conference . #% I thank the Commission and the authorities concerned for including for the first time a protocol in an FMD contingency plan for a non-susceptible species . #% Mr President , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice . #% Unfortunately , other Member States have not yet fully implemented the European legislation . #% Finally , I know that time is up but I wish to make two short points . #% The unanimity requirement for tax changes remains the order of the day within the Union . #% The German presidency can take solace from the fact that the spending parameters for the budget for the Union for the period 2000-2006 commands the confidence and the good will of all the Member States of the European Union . #% I would like to give the honourable Member the assurance that we will do everything in our power to ensure that the question he raises is addressed and that this problem is examined well in advance . #% It is really only Appendix I and Appendix II that require the sanction of the Conference of the Parties in this area . #% Citizens really worry about these issues . #% Mr President , from the spin of today one would think that much had been achieved at Hampton Court , but as we have already heard , the verdict of the informed EU press was almost universally negative . #% We should point out that it gave a statement of assurance in relation to revenue and administration . #% We do need to especially bear that in mind at this moment . #% It will in fact do damage from a health education point of view , as nutrient profiles are solely based on the composition of a food or food category and do not take into consideration the consumption of the food or food category or consumers ' individual habits . #% Mr President , you rightly say that the question of language should be dealt with by the Council with regard to what is and is not appropriate . #% It was quite unfair that , of all people , John Tomlinson should have been singled out . #% Yet , because it is so expensive it is not growing at all , any more than it is in western Europe . #% We debate the difference between commitments and appropriations and all sorts of technical details that mean nothing to the European public . #% The numbers of displaced people are increasing , with the UN reporting an additional 150 000 left homeless last month alone . #% I conclude my presentation by underlining that it is our fishermen and women who will have a central role in deciding the future of the European fishing industry . #% If the boats get faster and if the nets get bigger and more powerful , it is only natural that we should use all the modern technology available to us . #% This report will enhance our role as legislators . #% Certainly , as rapporteur last year , I saw a huge amount of duplication between the report produced by Parliament and the one the Council produced . #% The Irish presidency must guard against short-term solutions to the problem of funding the trans-European networks which involve diverting money from either the CAP or the structural funds , both of which must be maintained at their present level . #% We must ensure that we not only pay lip service to the disabled this year , but also give particular emphasis to those who can not speak for themselves , and mostly that means the elderly disabled . #% I am not that keen to get into this issue , but I simply want to say that the legal and justice provisions in the Republic of Ireland are already under way . #% It is the great drug barons whom we seem to tolerate . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , I will deal with just one of your four key priorities : stronger policies to promote job creation and demand for labour . #% The basic objective of the 6 to 12 miles coastal zone regime was to protect fishery resources by reserving access to small scale coastal fishery activities . #% UN forces led by the EU must ensure that United Nations Resolution 1701 is enforced and that , through cooperation with Lebanese troops and political leaders , Hizbollah can be disarmed . #% I have known you for some 20 years now and I know you to be a man of honour who has always been opposed to terrorism . #% We must be very careful with regard to that issue . #% I welcome President Santer 's statement today , but since 1989 the European Commission has been slow to recognize the seriousness of this disease and it failed to supervise the British response . #% I welcome President Santer 's initiative on territorial , regional and local employment pacts . #% I accept his reassurance that there is no link whatsoever between the terms of one appointment and those of any other . #% Even MEPs and representatives of the European Commission reportedly experienced intimidation and verbal aggression . #% I hope that the Council will not give in to this . #% In order to ensure food safety , the whole food chain must be flawless and its supervision comprehensive . #% I would hate anyone to misunderstand or misinterpret the decision of the Irish electorate not to approve the Treaty of Nice , because the Irish population in general , even those who oppose the adoption of the Treaty of Nice , is in favour of enlargement . #% This legislation governing the issue of civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and accidents in Europe will ensure that the rights of the 370 million consumers in Europe will be enhanced in the case of accidents taking place within any of the territories of the European Union . #% The American Government has to realise that it must comply with the rule of law and well-established international conventions and practices in its effort to defeat international terrorism . #% 
As such , they recommended that the product was suitable for release . #% Mr President , in the last Parliament MEPs voted overwhelmingly in support of the EU appointing an Aids ambassador/envoy . #% Of the three topics we are discussing , this is by far the worst and probably the most recurring , as speakers have said . #% They will have seen the efforts made by groups to work in partnership , to rebuild communities . #% This appalling saga has already gone on for far too long . #% These are questions that Members have already touched on . #% We also call on the non-nuclear weapons members of the NPT to fulfil their treaty commitments , i.e. not to receive , manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . #% Estonia , with its growth economy , well illustrates the point , as does the experience of the Republic of Ireland . #% It takes place at an important watershed with the reform of the structural and regional policies and the Agenda 2000 package . #% To maximise the potential of our work in this crucial area , we look forward to its extension to the countries of central and eastern Europe . #% We can see that with Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom there is no border in the new Europe between Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland . #% The motion clearly sets out what we believe the government of Nigeria must do , in accordance with its international obligations and the requirements of its own federal constitution . #% How we handle it and how it is detected is absolutely critical . #% In conclusion , the four-year consumer protection programme for 1999-2003 is worth over # 91m and if requests are made for further increases in this budget , I am confident that Parliament would support such recommendations in the future . #% Mrs President , on a point of order , every single month I find myself left out of Question Time , even though I am in the first 12 or 13 questions . #% Commissioner Flynn is to be congratulated for coming forward with a draft directive on worker consultation in firms with more than 50 employees . #% In no way does this over-bureaucratic and over-regulatory proposal appear to improve road safety records and therefore I consider it to be another unnecessary and unjustifiable piece of legislation . #% Perhaps , as Commissioner Rehn has outlined , we will resolve all these problems by October 2006 , but these two countries must accede . #% Mr President , this is an extremely interesting debate . #% If the Commission is not going to make a statement about this week , why not ? #% This can not happen without additional physical capacity , in the form of trans-European energy networks , to connect us all to a European grid . #% the status of religious organisations and #% Principle number two is to have institutions to do that . #% Why , therefore , is it necessary for this groundwater directive also to deal with nitrates ? #% There is an urgent need to comprehensively address the multiple problems in the inshore fishing sector in the European Union . #% Cod amounts to about 10 % of the value of all fish annually landed in Northern Ireland . #% It is essential that these concepts should not be enshrined in the Directive as it would open the way for abuses of all kind , and I feel the same applies to speeding up asylum procedures which could also downgrade the quality of the procedure . #% Finally , are we going to get a European framework for investment in R&D , in education , in lifelong learning , so that we can create a genuine engine for growth in Europe ? #% Madam President , I wish to join with the others in complimenting all involved , particularly on bringing this through conciliation successfully . #% I appeal to the Commissioner to come to Ireland , both North and South , hear the fisherman at first hand and act for them and the future of this industry . #% We ought to redouble all our efforts so as to be sure that next year 's world summit is up to the challenge of ensuring that development takes place in a sustained manner and also in a manner which protects existing communities . #% in writing . - Europe 's objective is a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East with a two-state solution at its heart . #% I remind the honourable Member that what I said is that the Asia-Oceania Working Group is examining the issue in the light of discussions held by the ministers at the General Affairs Council earlier this week . #% The one thing we can be sure of is not whether there is another outbreak of an exotic disease in the EU , but when . #% There is a clear demand for better computer resources in Irish schools . #% However , what is happening with legal bases ? #% I have personal experience of this in Ireland where prices on the housing market have simply exploded . #% I would like to see a democratic , stable assembly in Northern Ireland , where we make our own decisions for our own people and are able to make those decisions work . #% The retention of staging posts is important and the question of density also has an impact on the economics of transport . #% The inescapable truth is that Sinn FÃ©in , which masquerades as a democratic party and has two shameless Members in this House , is largely funded by organised criminal activity . #% I feel that the time has now come for the Commission and the EU Member States ' governments to come together and collectively do something urgently about this . #% I believe that will happen with this one as well , and quarry owners are not happy about that . #% We should copy that too . #% We have always been outspoken about condemning nuclear tests . #% So that is terribly important . #% We had a very good ferry service set up between Ballycastle and the south of Scotland which was forced to close recently because of lack of support and bureaucracy . #% I would like to see this situation immediately eased and I have made representations to the relevant minister in this regard . #% So , by the end of the year , I hope that we will see real progress on issues such as the maintenance of stability in stage 3 , the exchangerate relationship between the Euro and the pre-in currencies and , especially , on the technical preparatory work for the legal framework of the Euro . #% A key requirement in rural regions is access to information technology : to IT training and broadband . #% In addition , we should certainly be researching into restrictions on the marketing and use on the European market of dangerous substances to which newborn babies , children , pregnant women , elderly persons , workers and other high-risk sections of the population are heavily exposed . #% Over the past twelve months , in relation to the conduct of affairs with this House , Jacques Santer , unerringly if unwittingly , led his Commission to last week 's crisis-in-the-making . #% It is also quite interesting when looked at in another way : of all the scientists and inventors that have ever existed , 92 % are living today . #% It is ironic that those same people voted against our amendment in committee in relation to the fact that fragrances are included in baby products . #% We need now to look for some degree of legislative creativity , so that there is no sclerotic dysfunction : wanting to do the right thing , but by chance arriving at another dispute . #% What they see is a penny-pinching attitude , driven by an accountancy approach to politics , rather than the statecraft our citizens are crying out for . #% Setting the threshold at 150 GWP does not exclude the further refinement of CO2 technology , but it would allow our car manufacturers to maintain market penetration in all areas of the world . #% It is also important that when we decide to bring in new programmes , we ensure that the voluntary sector and the non-governmental organisations who are working at the coalface , who are there with women 's and children 's refuges to help them , are brought in at the very earliest stage to advise us of what is the most effective way of utilising funding . #% Could you confirm , however , that there will be an opportunity for those two commissioners to report to us on the important negotiations at Doha and whether the EU 's views were accepted or not . #% We need a system whereby those who have been convicted of paedophile offences are registered both nationally and internationally , with access only available to legal officers or those considering offering employment with privileged access to children . #% Whether we like it or not , that is what we are facing , plus the fact that aquaculture is an extremely dangerous industry in the impact it has on the environment . #% The arms embargo should remain in place until we can see a justification for lifting it . #% I suppose the fact that the opinions of these committees are sought is some consolation , but in a general way this decision needs some sort of explanation . #% Furthermore , the proposed price cuts without full compensation would have a devastating impact on Irish farming in particular and the Irish economy in general . #% The Commissioner 's relationship with our Parliament and its committees has always been constructive and positive and it should remain so . #% The priorities of the current presidency are environment , jobs and crime . #% The vast majority of European citizens do not want their money used to subsidise the inhumane transport of animals , which causes untold and unnecessary suffering . #% 
After more than 40 years of terrorism , violence and conflict all parties are now working towards a lasting peace in Ireland . #% It is an absolute disgrace the way that the RUC , the British army , the British Government and the Orange Order have decided that they are definitely going to make the six counties in the north-east of Ireland a Protestant State , an Orange State , for an Orange people , and forget about the human and civil rights of the nationalists and Catholics who are living there . #% Commissioner , thank you for your response . #% We must not stand on the sidelines in a disjointed and idle fashion and allow Slobodan Milosevic to run rings around the 15 Member States as he has done in the past . #% I hope that the Members of this Parliament will not be swayed by this simplistic rubbish . #% The direct payments being proposed by the Commission are not adequate and must be addressed before we can agree . #% In seeking to reinstate Parliament 's original amendments , the rapporteur has moved to strengthen the position of the citizen . #% Another called it a summit of impasse with a facade of forced smiles . #% Mr President , I welcome this opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate and to open with the comment that an early and satisfactory resolution of the controversy surrounding food safety is of paramount importance to consumers , to our farmers and indeed to the food industry . #% All of the EU fishermen involved in this project need to be applauded for their dedication , which removes waste permanently from the sea , benefiting the fishing industry , wildlife and the environment . #% As for reducing journey times and stocking densities , I urge that we be guided by science and not emotion , because this debate has been too much guided by emotion . #% It will fall to Commissioner Bolkestein to try to find the solution . #% I doubt very much that they could . #% Let me conclude by saying I welcome the speculation that the Feira Council will endorse the concept of a rapid reaction police force which would swing into action after completion of military tasks . #% But for us to agree to that , and for our representatives in the Convention to go along that line would require some faith from our point of view that we would be given more powers and consulted on a wider basis by the Commission and the Council when they look at these issues in the future . #% In this House on Tuesday , I listened carefully to one speaker after another talking about ` respecting the dignity of difference , respecting the right of Members to hold different opinions and showing tolerance to those opinions ' . #% The solution to the suffering and repression in Burma is not primarily about aid , although aid is required to relieve suffering . #% Many of them have lost their children for ever . #% Any family with more than three children , or families with grandparents or other household members , are dependent on bigger cars like people carriers and therefore will be forced to pay the consequences . #% The kind of detailed work that is involved in this kind of directive is never adequately appreciated outside of this House . #% Thank you for your response and also for giving us a few more moments . #% As drugs are part of the international terrorism network can you tell us what precisely you agreed at the G7 conference ? #% This is absolute nonsense . #% The Exchequer has collected EUR 3.5 million since March this year . #% A learner 's permit in one country may be equivalent to a full licence in another . #% The responsibilities of the European Union are based on the principle that there are some things we can do more efficiently at European level . #% I would say to the Commissioner , please accept our amendments in relation to this area . #% I have to say that the Caribbean ambassadors were utterly devastated by this decision . #% The region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world . #% Unelected diplomats should not be allowed to withdraw behind closed doors to dismantle the good work of the Convention . #% Madam President , I wish to speak on this report because it is necessary for the European Union to find a more effective way to ensure that Member States who make commitments in relation to matters of life and death actually comply with those commitments . #% The child often loses with the potential parents saying either ` no , thank you , ' or ` not yet ' . #% As an Irish Member , I believe we have benefited from what has been known as ` the Irish amendment ' . #% Will the office located in the small bedroom or the attic of the self-employed driver 's home be defined as his work station , and who will police and enforce the legislation ? #% We would like this mid-term review to consider the impact of EU fishing on both the fish stocks and the artisanal fishing community . #% The Union can not become the most knowledge-based economy in the world unless it takes full advantage of the new and evolving information technologies . #% The Commission proposes an extension of the excise tax regime on hydrocarbons to a much more comprehensive tax base , including sectors that have heretofore been excluded in some or all of the Member States - sectors such as coal , gas , electricity and home-heating oil . #% We want them to be more equitable , less environmentally and socially damaging and consistent with other Community policies . #% This is why we need an active cohesion policy orientated towards employment and growth . #% However , a recommendation to produce higher-quality data can not itself include inaccurate data . #% How is it that 117 or 118 new items not foreseen were added ? #% One of the issues that must be looked at most carefully relates to the regulatory framework in Europe -- we need less regulation in Europe , not more . #% This is not a trivial matter . #% I did not support amendments which failed to recognise the positive developments in relation to care for older people . #% Madam President , I do think it is probably incumbent upon this House to produce up-to-date reports but I would also insist that the statistics are checked not only by national or regional indicators , but with Eurostat , to make sure that we have the latest , up-to-date figures and not figures which some Members may wish to insert to make their case look worse in terms of their structural funds . #% Mr President , I want to say to the Commission that , in my view , any talk of imposition of sanctions on the peoples of the Indian sub-continent in response to the recent testing of nuclear weapons would be wrong . #% The only way to guarantee that is by involving the people more directly in open fora and in communication , etc. . #% Obviously , some people still feel upset that there is movement within Parliament . #% This figure , however , masks the higher energy import dependency of peripheral and geographically isolated energy markets such as the Baltics , Ireland and other island communities . #% Yet when a EU Member State re-introduces internment without trial and abolishes the right to judicial review , we remain silent and condone the kind of treatment that undermines civil liberties and totally ignores the European Convention on Human Rights . #% This simply means that the international community must now fully re-evaluate how best it can put in place security measures to defeat these acts of blatant and premeditated terrorism . #% For example , during the present global fight against terrorism we have , on occasions , turned a blind eye to the shortcomings of the undemocratic regimes we have enlisted to support us . #% Mr President , I have campaigned long and hard for the establishment of a European coastguard , and in the light of numerous maritime accidents and incidents that have occurred in recent years , the case for such a maritime force has never been stronger . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for his response . #% The pharmaceutical industry wants a total exemption from the directive . #% The intention was that we would use those powers , and I urge you to think very carefully before you reject this constructive measure . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office for a very comprehensive reply , and it seems to me that everything is going to be perfect after this Association Agreement is concluded . #% In Ireland we are obliged to have a referendum . #% You , Commissioner , talked of the political efforts that you are making , but do we deserve this praise ? #% Groundwater is a major national resource . #% Many of them are children who simply disappear and are murdered and are never found again . #% It was very important for us to have an opportunity to say whether nuclear weapons play a role of any kind in the future of the common , foreign and security policy . #% As European consumers it is our right to be able to buy bananas from those areas which represent good value for money and which reflect the democratic rights and good social standards that we expect and promote in those countries . #% in writing . - I voted to support the 2007 discharge for the European Commission , but I did so with some reservations . #% Too many people still live in unacceptable conditions in Romania 's institutions . #% With improving job opportunities outside agriculture I am worried about the continuity of family farming . #% 
Mr President , it is now clear that a new draft EU Treaty will be presented to our EU leaders in Thessaloniki . #% On the day when heads of state and government signed the Constitution in Rome , I happened to be in Bratislava , Slovakia , where I was privileged to participate in the opening of the House of Europe . #% There must also be respect for the Members of this House in their work and for the style in which they work . #% This gives greater protection to local fishermen , who are quite capable of exploiting every resource within that limit . #% The Israelis and Palestinians must resume the search for peace and the two sides must act together and they must act in tandem . #% Our big problem lies primarily with countries that have religious courts - but not exclusively . #% Such a defeat would be a victory for the eurosceptics . #% The nominee for president intends , health permitting , to serve at least until the switch-over from national notes and coins to euros has been achieved . #% Going back to the previous question , it was based on the other article , which relates to agricultural products . #% While I welcome the proven success of the Erasmus initiative , I would recall that there is certainly room for improvement in the manner in which this scheme is administered now within the European Union . #% Every day on the Internet , cross-border sales and business are alive and thriving , using the principle of mutual recognition . #% The commitment in the Amsterdam Treaty to preventing human illness and disease goes even further than the present Treaty and is therefore to be welcomed . #% I would like to reassure them . #% It is all too easy to import a problem , but it is very difficult to tackle a problem once it is within our borders . #% Each Member State has signed up to the European Convention of Human Rights which puts in place specific provisions for each individual . #% We must all ensure that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars at the design stage . #% We are calling on the Palestinian Authority in particular to work for his release as an absolute priority and on the Council and Commission to maximise their efforts to that end . #% This will help to guarantee that all air passengers in Europe are kept fully informed as to their legal rights with regard to air travel . #% It is unfortunate that the European Parliament is being forced to divide on such a fundamentally important issue for Spain . #% I like his phrase ` lean and clean ' . #% As a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , I am used to investing time and effort in an issue now in order to benefit future generations . #% If we can only have answers from the Commissioners who are available on the day -- Mr Monti and Mr Nielson in this case -- then why invite questions to any Commissioner ? #% Clearly , more than any other time , there is a need for financial institutions to pause and reassess their approach . #% I remain deeply concerned that the United States continues to choose to tackle the climate change issue through unilateral activities . #% Where exactly in the Treaty are the written permissions for these state aids ? #% Finally , I would like to ask the Commission to look at ensuring that these single points of delivery , these one-stop-shops that are so vital to delivering , monitoring and supervising the kind of services we want . #% There are instances where junior doctors in training are working 120 hours a week . #% We need to have some latitude at the level of individual installations to temporarily opt out of the scheme for the pilot phase only . #% I am , therefore , going to speak personally . #% The common fisheries policy has failed . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , this legislation is very necessary as the current legislation on residue control has led to a serious decrease in the availability of authorised veterinary medicines , creating adverse effects for public and animal health and welfare . #% The proposals on lifelong learning are an emerging response to this deficit , but only an emerging one . #% In the year of disabilities , it is not enough to say we are going to do a lot and then at the end of this year forget all about it and go along as normal . #% The students taking part in these activities are not just increasing their own knowledge and abilities to deal with the ever-changing nature and shape of the world in which we live , they also represent the future building-blocks for a new society and a new understanding and tolerance of the cultural diversity within the European Union . #% If the worst were to happen , and this package were rejected , another 20 years of negotiations would take place , resulting in a similar package and resulting in the same reservations that have been expressed . #% On the matter of the vote , you have given the correct interpretation . #% President-in-Office , I would like to join Mr McCartin in extending a very warm welcome to you . #% Recently a Socialist colleague of my own was banned from China . #% No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again . #% I fully commend you , Taoiseach , and the Minister for Foreign Affairs , Mr Brian Cowen , for all your work on this . #% From children to pensioners , from the corporate sector to small business , each will be exposed to this significant milestone in European administration . #% Mr President , the forthcoming Stockholm Summit will address many of the European Union 's key social and employment problems . #% We have some concern about whether enough reflection has been given by Parliament - and certainly not enough in our own group - to say that we want to see majority voting in Council also for the area of direct taxation . #% I went around the cities of Europe with Mr Colom i Naval and others and we asked them to sanction expansion of the budget by the 1.27 % - we needed at the time . #% It seems to me quite appalling that we have a situation in Europe where people are so desperate that they have to put themselves into the hands of criminals in order to try and find a new life in Europe . #% On a European level I welcome the Commission 's recent stakeholder consultation and hope that we can make our voice heard at the forthcoming COP 10 conference in which I will be delighted to participate . #% Only through slow and painful negotiations with compromises can that occur , only then can the Israelis and Palestinians be secure in their own states . #% Mr President , the assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and the seven other Palestinians was a clear breach of international law . #% In terms of implants for purely cosmetic reasons , we need to look at what the advertising industry is doing in relation to coercing people into something that they may regret in later years . #% Firstly , there is clearly good will among European Union leaders to secure an agreement for a new European Union Treaty , and I would like to commend the efforts of the President of the Council , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for the very positive role he has played in moving these negotiations forward in recent times . #% We can restore peace and confidence which was beginning to emerge . #% SMEs very much fall on both sides of the argument , some wanting to protect their ideas and inventions and others fearing a patents minefield with the proposed common position . #% How many of them had such lovely offices as we have here - and we are only here for four days a week . #% One small word of caution : let us not overplay our role and move into an area where we might be overlapping the negotiating mandate of the Commission . #% The current agreement provides little in the way of serious targeted measures and contains no provisions to ensure their transparent implementation or any assessment of the result . #% There are cases where it is necessary on health grounds , but it also needs to be - as the rapporteur has said - very well tracked , and information must be made available to patients . #% This matter of the eggs is one of hygiene and is not a consumer issue . #% Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very , very shoddy grounds ? #% I can assure this House that we have really tried very hard . #% Now that the war in Iraq has ended , the emphasis shifts to rebuilding and reconstruction . #% I most certainly hope and believe that it is against every objective and principle of the Commissioner 's directive that a Member State should be allowed to manipulate what is essentially an EU social benefit in this way . #% We can make common cause in this matter , and we must do so . ' #% Mr President , the next round of World Trade talks begins in Mexico next week . #% Of course he is a German politician , but the German Government is empowered and in a position to speak for Germany . #% So we must do all we can to break down the barriers that are in that particular region . #% I was in Colombia last year with NGOs and I can tell you that the situation there is really grave . #% 
It shows how little understanding this group has of the basic tenets of the rule of law in a democratic state . #% It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards . #% I am very happy to support Mr Pimenta 's report . #% There is a need for a new approach to foreign policy and indeed not only to foreign and development policy , but in all aspects of our dealings with third countries . #% My concluding comment is : get this money into the system fast ; intensify our efforts to restore consumer confidence in beef as a quality food product , which is what it is ; and assist in every way possible to develop third country markets as a profitable outlet for European beef . #% If these things can happen -- and they have happened -- with these countries supposedly adhering to the European Convention on Human Rights , then moving the coordination from the Council of Europe to the European Commission will contribute nothing to the effective guarantee of individual rights in real terms . #% When the euro is launched it will be necessary to exchange money held in present currencies for the new currency . #% This resolution seeks to encourage initiatives and action and ask the Commission to help perhaps with financial mechanisms to support the re-settlement of these people . #% I join my colleagues in supporting calls for Europe to make a real offer of financing to the developing world to help it fight climate change in order to break the deadlock in the current negotiations . #% I think it is very timely . #% Plan Colombia will result in USD 1.3 billion from the US being allocated for mainly military purposes . #% I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Wallis , for her persistence . #% Mr President , the advent of competition in the air transport sector has certainly resulted in the lowering of prices of air travel for the 370 million consumers of the European Union . #% I therefore today in the votes in the Parliament opposed any further reduction in stocking density as such will inevitably severely affect the economics of broiler chicken production within Europe . #% Much of this is due to the continued industrialisation of the sector , developing even larger vessels which require fewer people . #% We in this Parliament decided to terminate our parliamentary relationship with Pakistan . #% Another saying we have at home is ` at least no one died ' , but this is no longer true : people are dying . #% They have been experienced in Ireland , Britain , Spain and other European countries : that is why we share and understand the pain of those who have suffered . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate you on your election to your new post and I wish you well . #% We note the assurances given by the Turkish authorities that they intend to pursue the process of constitutional and legislative reform , and we are continuing to press them to go down that road . #% We have a duty not just to pontificate about rights , but to actively encourage access to education , training , employment and opportunity . #% It is time that we realised that we must count the cost of processing the waste from these nuclear facilities as an intrinsic part of the cost . #% Coming from Ireland , I can confirm tragically that threats to children come traditionally from within institutions where they are supposed to be safe , within certain families and within certain areas of the Catholic Church . #% Durban was not a failure , nor was it indeed a great success ; but it re-emphasised the imperative to make racism a crime , something I have called for many times in this House . #% in writing . - The draft regulation is intended to ensure that third-country nationals who are legally resident within the EU and are in a cross-border situation concerning at least two Member States are subject to the same rules for coordinating social security entitlements as EU nationals under the abovementioned regulations . #% I am not satisfied - and this was confirmed to me by the Commissioner 's remarks - that EU Governments are serious about this issue . #% It is completely unacceptable that , in relation to fisheries agreements , EU fishing vessels take priority over the rights of people in other countries . #% This must include the fishermen , national authorities and scientists , and the Figueiredo report later today will deal with that . #% This would give the local fishing interests a wider scope and a more solid basis on which to plan their investments . #% I note what the honourable Member has said in his contribution . #% We must make every effort to protect and save them for the possibility of future use . #% Lest this should get out of hand , my appeal would be for a calm assessment of the matter , to make an evaluation and find a way forward . #% We need to address this . #% All too often when there is one abduction there is a re-abduction by the other parent . #% The first half was the worst in the history of the world : two world wars and 50 million human beings slaughtered . #% Acts such as these serve simply to confuse , without serving any real purpose . #% If the overall social , human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be achieved then strict standards for reducing air pollution must be an imperative . #% It is quite clear that what you are doing here is militarizing the EU , turning it into a military alliance , the main purpose of which is to protect its selfish interests and get easy access to global resources . #% The question of the changes which will take place over the next few years concerning the age profile in the European Union and the effect that will have is something which is concentrating all of our minds , not only because of the purely economic aspects - how we can pay the old age pension for people who are over 65 years of age , how we can have a new breed of workers entering the labour market to ensure that they pay enough social security etcetera - but there is also the great question of how we care for those who are elderly . #% Equally we can not continue to mortgage our children 's health and heritage . #% Regrettably the take-up and use of these funds by the Member States is still deplorably low . #% The Union should allocate resources from its annual budget to intercept smugglers as the drugs are introduced to the Union , to control the distribution of substances used in the manufacture of drugs within the Union and to investigate the money-laundering activities of the drug barons . #% As far as Hong Kong is concerned , I welcome the fact that the handover has taken place without many of our worst fears having been realised . #% We conducted hearings on how these funds work . #% I would like to thank the leader of our delegation , Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo , and all colleagues for making it that . #% My problems began this morning at a very early point when my flight from Belfast to London was cancelled . #% That is why I voted against recital 25 . #% I suppose , very much like motherhood and apple pie , everybody in the European Union , the Member States , all the political groupings , rhetorically at least , share a commitment to social solidarity , social justice , social cohesion . #% At the present time , there are about 800 million people in the world who do not have enough food and this includes 300 million children . #% The Irish presidency and members of governments generally find themselves in this category . #% Recently there have been reports in British newspapers which point out that European leaders have ordered police and intelligence agencies to coordinate their efforts to identify and track anti-capitalist demonstrators . #% In fact , one must welcome the recent position of the Internal Affairs Council of Ministers ' meeting , at which it was agreed that the procedural red-tape would be cut , to allow the European Commission to demand reasonable action by Member States to unblock roads or ports within days of blockades being set up as a result of strikes , or face action in the European Court of Justice . #% Ireland in no way supports the use of nuclear energy . #% If you look at the fact that we gave approximately EUR 900 million to Ethiopia between 2002 and 2005 , we do not seem to be getting any respect for human rights in that country . #% Jerusalem is the key issue and it needs to be looked at in a new light . #% I want to know whether a proposal in the annex overrules the earlier vote on the draft Statute , namely not to have a transitional period . #% I hope Minister Noel Tracy takes this up urgently and all Member States ensure smooth administration of arrangements for finalising the PEACE 11 funding , and guarantee continuing funding for a PEACE 111 programme for 2007-2013 . #% Will it interfere with the rights of people who are unhappy with the status quo and want to change things ? #% That is why I fully support the recommendation in this report that at least EUR 300 million be put aside under the 7th Research Framework Programme ( 2007-2012 ) to promote a higher standard of health within the European Union . #% This year - 2003 - is the year of the disabled . #% Lastly , in giving my support to this report and the accession process , I also wish to see the accession countries , national parliaments and governments having the same voting rights at the European Convention as the existing Member States of the Union . #% Developing countries ' perception of our good faith , good will and sincerity towards them will be tested by our attitude to these two issues . #% I would urge Commissioner KovÃ¡cs , in relation to taxation , that ` if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ' and above all ` do n't break it ' ! #% We are investing heavily in the implementation of food safety measures and have banned the use of growth promoters . #% There is no doubt that we need interoperability between our air traffic control systems ; we need better integration and better and more common equipment and training of staff . #% That was to keep pressure on companies to decrease their emissions . #% 
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Nicholson for his report , and for the speed with which he researched and did the work . #% According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force , whereas Parliament 's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years . #% I was accredited with not being present in this House to record my vote when , in actual fact , I was here but my card was faulty . #% As I see it , we have a good piece of legislation : the framework directive requesting employers to mitigate health risks for employees . #% This should also be the case with Equatorial Guinea . #% Mr President , I should also like to congratulate Mr Macartney on his report . #% If we are to expect that suddenly action will be taken because of the horrific gunning-down of Anna Politkovskaya in recent days , I think we are like ostriches sticking our heads in the sand . #% Could I also suggest that they might consider using the Treaty of Nice provision which allows for decisions of this nature to be taken by QMV rather than unanimity . #% Indeed , I agree with Mr Hatzidakis that they have all run a marathon . #% This financing must be new and additional ( the existing promises of 0.7 % should not be touched ) and it must be adequate enough to allow developing countries to fight climate change , with the necessary mitigation and adaptation measures . #% Many people have quoted Irish poets over the past few days in the big speeches that have been made , Seamus Heaney in particular , and his line that hope chimes with history . #% It is important that we all follow suit - from the technical end to us as parliamentarians - as we express ourselves . #% In that opinion , it states that your role will be confined to what is set out in the Treaty on the European Union and also on the decisions taken at the European Council meeting in Cologne . #% Cohesion policies are vital to delivering a citizen 's Europe and giving tangible support to regions and communities , to open up access to the opportunities of the single market for jobs and training . #% Mr President , I should first like to thank Mr Rehder for his work . #% The tenor of his remarks is to condemn reprocessing as a sinister activity . #% I would also agree with Mrs Hermange who rightly pointed out that , up to very recently , children could not even be mentioned in this House . #% This is on the IGC agenda as well , but so far all we have heard about is a European Commission action plan for enterprise -- which received a very lukewarm reception indeed and was accused of lacking focus and tangible recommendations . #% It is unfortunate that the EPO has granted it a patent : this is an example of bad EPO practice . #% With this practical caveat , I give my full support to the proposal . #% Mr President , we have come to depend in the 21st century on what we call a knowledge based economy and the information society . #% Nothing could be further from the truth , and I have therefore voted against this report . #% It is incumbent upon us to find a better way rather than witness the senseless slaughter we have recently seen . #% Irish farmers are worried that beef and dairy will be sacrificed next , in an effort to get trade concessions in services . #% The Sixth Framework Programme is the first implementation of the European Research Area , which itself is a consequence of the Lisbon Summit and its wish for us to have a successful knowledge-based economy , because of the strong correlation between research and development and economic success - inadequate in most EU countries outside Scandinavia , I should say . #% I would reiterate in conclusion my support for the use of OIE provisions to have an internationally recognised basis for classification , a basis supported by 150 countries in resolving world trade disputes and recognised by the WTO . #% Given the cross-border dimension of this issue , I would urge the Commission to carve out an effective and strong role for itself in order to protect minors and halt the trafficking of players . #% The more we shout about fraud and corruption , the less seriously we will be taken unless it is absolutely necessary and unless we know exactly what we are talking about . #% May I say in reply to the question posed by the honourable Member that I am very well aware of the difficulties faced by sheep farmers , not just in Ireland , but in Europe generally . #% They could not do this for other fishermen , but only for their own . #% It is extraordinary that while we know that 20 % of the weapons that the United States sells fall into the wrong hands , we have no statistics whatsoever on the quantity of arms exports from the European Union that fall into the wrong hands . #% There is a balance to be struck between the rights of the individual and the rights of the common good . #% This directive is part of an overall package which is being implemented by the European Union at this time to comply with the obligations under the Kyoto Accord . #% We all know , and it has been said already , that the Yemen has made great progress recently in democratization and in respect for basic human rights . #% European leaders and European Union institutions can equally point to the fact that an internal market has been put in place , allowing free movement of goods , persons , services and capital , as well as the creation of a new single currency regime which commands so much influence within the European Union itself . #% I voted for the Bakopoulos report to ensure our seas are safe and that ship pollution is prevented . #% The reason I gave so much information - like you I had access to this information - was that it could be an attempt by a private company or by groups of private companies to distort the market before the full impact of European Union law becomes legal and to interfere so that no action can be taken afterwards . #% It is up to the 15 Member States of the European Union to implement the provisions of this recommendation . #% If BNFL has problems in discharging radioactive products such as technetium 99 , it should store such waste materials on land in Britain as opposed to dumping them in the Irish Sea . #% I would be pleased to hear whether you accept that we ought to drop the push for investment to be included . #% I would also like to thank Mr Cohn-Bendit for devoting so much attention to me , as always . #% Whether we are talking about Potsdam , Hungary , GdaÅsk , Siberia , Spain , Portugal or Ireland , those who have tried to impose their will on others have always failed , because the very essence of our humanity is the desire to be free to ensure that we can live and interact with others . #% Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has outlined to us in detail the importance of the multi-functional role of the EU fisheries . #% The Council wishes to maintain and deepen relations with Albania . #% Mr President , at this moment of the emergence of a draft Treaty on the IGC , are we to find once again that , contrary to assurances we have heard this morning on citizenship and democracy , a review of the Euratom Treaty has been neglected ? #% I am certainly taken aback by the President-in-Office 's response . #% Restricting pornography that uses or targets children should not be seen as an affront to true freedom . #% As we have seen with the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease , Newcastle disease and other animal diseases , a policy aimed at slaughtering animals is the only sure way of killing off the disease . #% The other issue I should like to address is the contamination of gene transfer . #% Hong Kong failed to make any substantial headway on the liberalisation of the international trade in services or non-agricultural market access . #% We are also sending soldiers to stop the fighting there despite the fact that most of the fighting is taking place with weapons supplied by countries within the European Union . #% We already had all the knowledge necessary . #% This has to be exercised complementing the activities carried out in the Member States - Article 164 of the EC Treaty - and always in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity - Article 5 of the EC Treaty - and respecting the national identities of its Member States - Article 6 of the EU Treaty . #% I would also like to express my great regret that six years after those heinous crimes were exposed , this man has still not been brought to justice . #% His comments are summed up in his last letter to me some weeks ago : `` the process is clearly designed to discourage small inventors and favours large business equipped with legal and patent expertise to navigate its treacherous bureaucracy . '' #% Mr President , firstly I welcome the opportunity of congratulating the United Kingdom presidency on its success on behalf of all of us in the European Union . #% In the case of Ireland this means wiping out the sugar industry and making way for corporate farmers from other countries . #% I speak in particular of people with disabilities , those who have hearing difficulties who could have text messages brought to them , or those who are blind who should have access to voice-activated messages . #% We need to ensure the introduction of a 100 % whole baggage screening process at all airports in Europe . #% Who knew of the difficulties in Equitable Life and when ? #% The committee is also going to need more time to carry out a comprehensive , comparative analysis into the operation of similar life assurance markets in Germany and in Ireland . #% The public must always be given a choice when it comes to news dissemination . #% What must also concern us is the escalation of the conflict beyond Kosovo and into Albania . #% Unless we are willing to cooperate with each other and learn from the best practices available , we can not hope to resolve these difficulties . #% In the process European farmers - the people on whom we rely to produce our food requirements - are in serious financial difficulty , so much so that many of them , even with compensation , will be forced out of business . #% As far as the environment and jobs are concerned , renewable energy is extremely relevant - I am not so sure about crime ! #% 
However , some people at the EU Convention are rushing ahead with extensive reform in all matters connected with the day-to-day operation of the Union . #% Does that mean that we are to expect a modified regulation or simply a modified proposal on the performance reserve ? #% I understand now that all the political groups have agreed to this being removed . #% We had gone from a worthy ambition of seven last August to up to three , plus of course Penta BDE , the Norwegian proposal , which might be a fourth one . #% It is a figure drawn from thin air which somehow gives the impression that pesticide use is inherently bad . #% We have the great privilege in this House to be the representatives of the people of Europe . #% For example , certain fish stocks , EU experts told us , would become extinct in the Irish Sea unless their proposals were carried through . #% We have made clear our view that further reforms are necessary in such areas as human rights , freedom of expression and democratic freedoms and we will continue to do so . #% Nonetheless , given the large uncertainties and the major risks involved , the provision for force majeure must be retained . #% Furthermore , there are even in-built safeguard clauses in this derogation which would cause the whole derogation to lapse should any new entrant to the rail markets of Ireland or Greece appear . #% For too long they have been the poor relation , particularly to the vast funds that the nuclear lobby has been able to access by fair means or foul , as I have already outlined . #% The UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Burma has expressed very deep concern about the recent reports that members of the NLD continue to be victims of arbitrary arrests and various forms of restriction . #% Parliament 's amendments to the Council of Ministers ' common position encompass the budget - we insisted on an increase to EUR 200 million with a review clause - and numerous clarifications . #% The regulation provides for the establishment of central authorities which are not responsible for the actual transmission of documents but which will respond to requests for supplying information from requested agencies . #% It is not enough to develop technology . #% Regrettably , our consumer society is contributing to an increasing volume of domestic waste and there is also growing concern in relation to industrial waste . #% It is important to state that the establishment of a European budget for the construction of these networks must not be at the expense either of the structural funds or of the common agricultural policy . #% We need to get clarification from the Romanian authorities about these children . #% We are talking about major European oil companies and they should be held accountable for their activities . #% Mr President , I have here today as my guest , and as the guest of many Members , the Dairy Trade Coalition from the United States of America . #% Look at our next big spending : regional policy . #% It is well known - indeed Germany informed the International Conference - that 19 cases of thefts involving nuclear materials have been discovered over the last two years . #% This bill is a wholesale departure from both Irish and British Government agreements and the Cory recommendations . #% Heed the clamour for more state rights , not centralisation ; more local control , not ` Brusselisation ' . #% I think the example of UNICEF is a good place to start in understanding the desperate and urgent need to reform the UN . #% Key chapters of discussions which it was said will be opened during the Belgian presidency include competition policy , transport , energy , taxation , customs union , veterinary and hygiene aspects of agriculture , fisheries , justice and home affairs , and financial control . #% Provision of information on cancer risks to outdoor workers is not a burden on employers ; it is an investment in a healthy workforce . #% Of course , governments and local authorities can give monies to their own cities , but there is a wider European dimension which requires extra financing at European level . #% I do not accept this broad statement - as in the single farm payment is paid to active producers NOT landowners . #% The gap is measured most starkly by the 18 million people out of work and up to 50 million suffering from social exclusion and poverty . #% In fact , they flout numerous examples of EU legislation , such as the 1984 Directive on Misleading Advertising . #% Prevention is in every way as crucial as reaction to natural disasters and I welcome the inclusion of the concept of prevention in the report . #% I fully realise the absolute requirement to make way for enlargement of the Union to the east and to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the forthcoming WTO round . #% For nearly ten years the EU has had a ban on the sale of products tested on animals but we have yet to implement this . #% When an effort is occasionally made it is usually far too little and absolutely too late . #% Therefore it is vital that the rural development regulation aids , rather than aggravates , our situation . #% As someone from Northern Ireland , I would just like to say that the people there were very envious of the cohesion funding received by the Republic of Ireland , because it certainly helped that country . #% Over the next six months the Belgian presidency will have a coordinating role as we put in place the finishing touches to the launch of the euro notes and coins on 1 January next . #% I am particularly satisfied that the European Parliament has rejected the Commission 's proposal to re-brand municipal waste incinerators based on certain criteria . #% It is very clear that we need to convert old social spending methods into new economic and social opportunity . #% Mr President , ' Die Politik ist keine exakte Wissenschaft ' . #% In Northern Ireland there are no such structures in place . #% Madam President , I would say to President Barroso that it is true the first five years of Lisbon have delivered little and most Member States , which bear the ultimate responsibility for implementing the Lisbon Agenda , have been very slow to take ownership . #% This is a very serious matter and one which the presidency takes very seriously . #% I know there is a different set of criteria for abduction by parents , but surely we should not make so great a distinction between criminally and parentally-abducted children ? #% Finally , despite the problems therefore , I welcome the very positive approach taken by the rapporteur . #% The DAA said that , if the Department of Transport gives the go-ahead , which seems very likely , and the equipment proved successful , the scanners could be extended to Cork and Shannon airports . #% Nevertheless , we need to keep pushing for the ILO to be granted observer status in , and the right to speak at , the WTO , and a committee on trade and decent work should be created within the WTO . #% In fact , for the first time , specific mention was made of that doctrine whereby the Union can only operate on the powers conferred upon it by the Member States . #% And we weigh up the cost of a child against the cost of getting ahead or a social life or a car or a house or a vacation . #% The coastal zone requires special management . #% Resources are obviously required . #% You might not quite understand what is going on , you might have to pretend you understand , but the mere fact that they are aware that you are interested and with them might in itself be a very useful way in which we can deal with this . #% The growing support for a FTT must be driven hard by public opinion for governments to act , and not to cave in to the people for whom greed is not enough . #% We have to investigate the operations of Finansbank , we have to investigate the operations of Gama , and we have to tell the Turkish authorities that companies incorporated in Turkey must comply with European law when they operate in the European Union . #% This could be a significant advance given that at present several members of the outgoing Commission are responsible for different areas , which range from the legal aspects of migration , humanitarian aid and the free movement of persons to the foreign policy aspects of migration . #% It is only realistic to expect that many problems will lie ahead - some will be minor , others more serious . #% Additionally , he is strongly critical of the fact that proposals on the free movement of people and tax harmonisation have not been adopted . #% The Brazilian Ambassador did not lobby me . #% You also have extremely toxic ash left afterwards . #% Member States will not be able to allow the registration and entry into service of light commercial vehicles if they do not have a valid certificate of conformity for this type of approval after 1 January 2007 . #% Currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed . #% Let us be clear : this was a choice between no information and providing information to the workforce in the process of a takeover or merger . #% It is to say the least disappointing , that some Member States were prepared to conceal the real incidence of BSE in their national herds and equally unwilling to implement the control measures proposed by the Commission and agreed by this Parliament . #% But I can assure the Member that , in relation to the working of the single market and the free movement of people , the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will consider the point raised . #% Your Financial Stability Mechanism is a vicious weapon dictated by the markets , masquerading as something benign . #% 
The difficulty with Ireland is that it already has freedom of movement between Ireland , Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom . #% It is clear that there are a number of gaps remaining and that the insuree and the claimant still face certain difficulties which need to be addressed . #% Specific safeguards are necessary in the health care sector . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work on this report . #% I would like to conclude by not only congratulating the Danish Presidency once again and welcoming the fact that its confidence proved to be right , but also by wishing it a similar success at the Copenhagen Council . #% I thought then that if I had stood there 30 years ago at the end of the Second World War -- the worst half century in the history of the world in which 50 million human beings were slaughtered -- and had said to myself ` do n't worry , it 's all over , they will all be united very soon ' , I would have been sent to a psychiatrist . #% I note in particular that the Council has failed to include minimum distances from residential areas for landfills which contain either hazardous or non-hazardous waste . #% At the same time , of course , we believe that terrorism should be fought in all ways . #% Mining companies need to establish decommissioning plans for new and existing mines and tailing ponds . #% It is nonsense to try to ensure that we have a body which in the long term will deal with communicable diseases but which will not have the resources to do its job effectively . #% In addition , just last month the Food Supplements Directive , which had a positive list of allowed substances , was found to be illegal by the Advocate General in Luxembourg . #% There is a lot of hypocrisy regarding people from the new Member States . #% He has approached this matter with his usual conviction and great dedication . #% I know that the Portuguese presidency is very familiar with this issue . #% Huge numbers of EU citizens choose to take supplements to reduce the possibility of their falling ill and needing to seek medical advice to obtain prescribed drugs . #% in writing . - The media law adopted by Hungary 's Parliament is clearly at odds with Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that guarantees freedom of expression and information . #% It is not about the very short-term fortunes of any national political party for electoral purposes . #% A report is in preparation on the issue of funding for the European schools to enable children with special needs to be catered for , in the same way that all children attending European schools are catered for , free of charge with compulsory education . #% Countries with low debt should be allowed to invest in key infrastructural projects of national importance . #% Who decides when articles of the Treaty are in conflict or when the Commission acts in such a way as to bring those articles into conflict with one another ? #% So , moving on from language to what I consider to have been a very successful Irish presidency , I want to congratulate the Taoiseach , his ministers , and in particular Minister Cowen and Minister Roche , who is with the Taoiseach here today . #% But with regard to the level of agreement that we have achieved in relation to the directive , I want to thank the Council and the Commission , the staff of the Employment Committee and the staff of my own group for their assistance . #% Let the farmers produce the food . #% It is spread all over the place ! #% An important element in ensuring that this happens , as has already been said by Mr Smith in proposing the resolution , is the role of both the Council and the Commission . #% This policy is doing the image of the Union no good either with its own producers or abroad . #% I shall refer to the European Union 's response to that shortly . #% It is scandalous that these attempts by the Irish delegation to delete clauses are claimed as being in accordance with the precautionary principle . #% If I am a red-haired , fair-skinned Irish person , two hours ' sunshine is the maximum I should get , and with proper coverage from the sun , with a hat , covering up my skin and wearing protection . #% The Commission must respect Parliament 's prerogative and wait until all three institutions , the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission , have reached agreement on the microfinance facility before submitting a draft Progress annual plan of work . #% The recommendation that the Commission unequivocally takes account of libraries and their role as an information source for members of the public when resolving copyright disputes , may well be opposed by some Member States . #% We hope this will set a precedent for many of the other Islamic countries who do not feel , due to the type of legislation they have -- Sharia law -- that they can sign the 1980 Convention . #% But up to three could be none , one or two as well as three . #% If we are really to have a non-military as well as military capacity , an effective voice at the Security Council table would be important especially in our outreach beyond Europe itself . #% I would also like to object in very strong terms to the personal attacks on me by the Conservative Party last night . #% We in the European Parliament are very much for freedom of speech and freedom of information but we are even more concerned to protect children against criminal and violent abuse . #% The action proposed by the White Paper involves rebalancing the different modes of transport ; developing high quality rail services ; promoting short sea crossings ; inland waterways and combined transport ; and promoting fair competition between the sectors . #% There is growing political support for this position . #% I am very interested in looking into the creation of a carbon fund for Africa , as the Commissioner has suggested , and where that will take us . #% It is a question of power and how power is abused . #% I hope very much that Parliament will clearly indicate their support for the re-introduction of the original time of four years for the inclusion of junior doctors in this directive . #% These workers are concerned because they understand that such an agreement will be implemented primarily in the economic interests of big business in both Canada and in the European Union and not primarily in the interests of working people or of social justice . #% Ireland must be prepared to play a constructive and positive role within the framework of the European Union to assist in solving the crisis in Kosovo and in guaranteeing that Slobodan Milosevic does not achieve his aim of bringing about the genocide of the native Albanians in Kosovo . #% I hope that this month , given the weight of opinion expressed here today , this will now be listened to . #% Mr President , I think the last speaker , Mr Santini , made an error which a lot of people make , confusing nationality and citizenship . #% We owe it to our consumers and businesses to make the right decision for them and ensure that any change of law affecting their rights is properly thought through . #% The hypocrisy of those amendments should be exposed so that Members are absolutely clear on what they are voting . #% On a date when he alleged I signed in late I actually was present early that morning voting in my committee . #% She said you can not expect her to condemn human rights abuses in other parts of the world and let the United Nations itself be responsible for what is happening in Iraq following the sanctions . #% One such problem relates to the need to provide greater childcare facilities for women who take up jobs in rural parts of my country and indeed , throughout Europe . #% Evidence shows that women are currently benefiting considerably from the provisions already in force within the UK , 9 out of 10 women taking the 20 weeks maternity leave , as well as 3 in 4 women taking all their paid leave . #% Do you want your children to be involved in industries that are responsible for the persecution and death of so many people around the world ? #% This was not finally accepted until the WHO Conference in Geneva last year when the findings of the thyroid project , based in Minsk , were adopted . #% It proposes to simplify the procedure for registering new and existing substances and it will increase our knowledge of their effects and ensure safe use at all stages in their lifecycle . #% In the interests of fighting international terrorism , these men should be returned to Colombia to finish the sentences they were given originally , and not be allowed to go free , as they are at present , to flout international will . #% I would certainly urge the Commission to ensure that somehow or other Parliament is more closely involved , when we can anticipate changes like this without , of course , transgressing on the Commission 's own proper function in respect of executive decisions and negotiations with the various Member States on the detailed aspects of the proposals . #% As the rapporteur has said , if we do not do something about fish stocks , there will be no fishing industry in the future as there will be no fish . #% The Tories used to announce every year that they were blocking a few arms exports to ruthless regimes while at the very same time proceeding with much greater deals . #% I support the recommendation that all schools in Europe must be equipped with the Internet . #% Everything must be anchored in the developing countries with an understanding that , should we find these things , should we find a better vaccine for tuberculosis , better drugs for HIV/AIDS and better diagnostic tests , they will be available to those that need them . #% Greenland withdrew from the Union . #% The Bilderberg meeting is starting at the weekend . #% Mr President , this is obviously an initial reaction , and clearly we are going to have to come back to this in more detail . #% Specifically , have amendments to the Euratom Treaty , which would provide vigorous scrutiny of the safety of nuclear facilities , been agreed ? #% But there are other areas where there is a lot of confusion . #% This directive does not mean that Member States can not bring in more stringent measures to curb cigarette smoking if they so wish . #% 
Famagusta is a city on the east coast of Cyprus . #% Mr President , I was always amazed at the Commissioner 's optimism throughout these talks . #% This experience should now be put to good use in the interests of the people of Iraq . #% I would like to urge the European Union governments to go the extra mile and strike an agreement which will ensure effective operation of the European Union for many years to come . #% Finally , the guidance and leadership that the Commissioner has given on this issue , and the clear thinking and cool logic which has been shown , is a model that other Commissioners would do well to follow when dealing with other public service issues . #% We look forward to more directives as promised by the Commissioner in this important area of energy efficiency , of energy intelligence . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for helping to protect regional individuality and rural self-sufficiency . #% It was regrettable that the review of the packaging directive did not deal with this properly . #% This suggestion is an indication of the obsession of the europhile leaders of Europe , an obsession that knows no bounds . #% We should be clear about the internal challenges we face : one in five of Europe 's youth is out of work , unemployment among women is consistently higher than among men , long-term unemployment persists as a scourge of modern society . #% European Union airlines , consumer groups and air crew workers must all work together to guarantee that all public health issues concerning air travel are fully addressed . #% Yes , Commissioner , there is no need to paint the picture of the return of the Spanish Armada . #% Is it any wonder that people turn off Brussels or Strasbourg ? #% This is a programme that was presented many months late by the Commission - it should have started in January this year . #% We must also invest more in research and development policies . #% One option which must not be implemented is a possible renationalising of the financing of the common agricultural policy . #% Further discussion with the OIE , the World Organisation for Animal Health , is urgently necessary to ensure that an infected country can regain its FMD-free status as soon as possible . #% I sat through an earlier debate relating to this today and one might wonder whether Parliament is united in accepting the basic principle of the recommendations of the Scientific Committee . #% I hope that despite this crisis , our national governments will be able to listen to suggestions from this House and work together in a constructive manner . #% There must be compassion . #% Some Member States within the Council feel that Schengen should have a treaty base , others that it should not and they do not want to sign up for it . #% I welcome international cooperation , but we still have an awful lot of work to do . #% The Council should be very much involved and should come forward in the very near future with plans and with some hope of a definite outcome in this important area . #% These attacks culminated recently in a classic hatchet job programme made by an English television company and broadcast in three or four of the Member States . #% You will know , as a Member of the Bureau , Madam President , that I wrote to you and to all of the Members of the Bureau yesterday , and in that letter I cited some direct quotations from the Member in question . #% For us it is not just the principle of involving the local partners - it actually makes good sense because they know the issues on the ground . #% It is not rational to make a cut in real terms in research in 1999 and the beginning of the next century . #% The time has come for Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness to produce the people guilty of this crime and oblige them to submit themselves to the will of the courts . #% It makes sense to have a coordinated EU policy on combating Aids , under the responsibility of a single Aids ambassador/envoy , and I urge Parliament and the Commission to move forward with this proposal and add impetus to the effort to put Aids on the top of the EU development agenda . #% As the Commission points out , tens of thousands of human beings - especially women and children - are trafficked for exploitative purposes each year . #% Ms Tongue has pointed out that this is a political issue and indeed it very much is . #% Five of the nine people for whose disappearance the IRA claims responsibility remain unaccounted for . #% The next stage will be commercial exploitation , which our own bio-patenting directive allows for . #% If anything , Europe should be about defending freedom of speech , freedom of thought and freedom of ideas , even though we may not agree with those ideas or thoughts . #% These young journalists were totally amazed at the deep concerns many of us have about all aspects of childcare in Romania . #% For the large majority the issue was peaceful and proper demonstration . #% In my contribution last month I called for an EU taskforce to police the implementation of the control measures in Member States . #% It has never been demonstrated that this can be achieved and technical advice from engineers involved in microchip design and manufacture indicates that it will never be easy or even possible to achieve . #% In this regard , proper consultation of the fishing and aquaculture industries is not only desirable , but absolutely necessary and essential so as to avoid any detrimental consequences for the fishing industry that may be caused by levels not scientifically justified . #% Why did your government vote to allow EU funding for embryo-destructive research , when our people have always cherished the most vulnerable citizens ? #% It is no good saying , as the US has said to us , that diversification is the answer . #% Mr President , the Portuguese Government claims that the activities on board the ` Women on Waves ' ship violate Portuguese law . #% I am delighted that when agriculture suddenly becomes food , we debate this very important issue in the middle of the day when people can hear . #% It is imperative that we should avoid simplistic assertions that these atrocious killings are the results of religious hatred alone . #% From an Irish perspective , the influx of refugees , asylum seekers and immigrants is a relatively new experience for us as a nation . #% We need a system where we get back what we spend , but this should not be tied in with a lot of other matters . #% We have refused urgent treatment for the other two proposals . #% These mountains of ageing refrigerators , and in warmer climates air conditioners , are rusting in every population centre in the EU . #% The whole globe shares the same ozone layer . #% The conditions are deplorable from a health and safety point of view , if nothing else . #% I do not know British law that well , but I suspect that if this case was in Ireland the complainants could force you to produce the information . #% The situation in Ireland is extremely serious and unless there is some recovery in prices , many farmers will not survive . #% Is it wise for this Parliament to start telling people what to eat , rather than providing them with information of what they are eating ? #% Mr President , in September 1998 negotiations started between the EU and the ACP to agree the successor to the LomÃ© Convention . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office whether he perceives the role of family farming as representing the backbone of the rural economy . #% This is increasingly the case , even before one deals with the question of allowing either men or women time off to have babies or to look after children . #% Why isolate and point a finger at Islamic fundamentalism when we do not truly understand the meaning and the philosophy behind Islam anyway ? #% As a result , the Commission ended the last day trying to exclude us from the press conference , albeit very politely and diplomatically . #% But in welcoming the decision as we do , we insist that those modernising forces must make determined progress towards European norms of respect for human rights and of the relationship between civil and military society ; towards the abolition of the death penalty ; towards a clear respect for minorities , especially the Kurdish minority in Turkey . #% I want to thank Parliament for debating this issue . #% I support the agenda set by the EU leaders at their summit in Lisbon last year . #% He may feel that his efforts in this agreement are wasted and not appreciated . #% Mr President , the United Nations has been emasculated by two members of the Security Council on the issue of sanctions on Iraq . #% As you know , the OSPAR commission met in Sintra two years ago and some progress was made on pollution of the marine environment . #% Very private information about people will be accessible to police and secret services without those people having any say or control . #% We have some concerns in relation to deadlines . #% 
We need to have a concrete example of your commitment . #% in writing . - Having visited Gaza earlier this year , I have seen in person how vital it is that Parliament acts in this area . #% The key problem that I want to highlight today in connection with the Teverson report , in the light of the budgetary debate in 1997 and Council 's decision on 25th July to cut structural fund payments in some areas , is the perceived problem of under-utilization of structural funds . #% If there is a hard landing in the construction industry ; it has implications for revenue ; it has implications for unemployment payments and therefore revenue ; it has implications for consumer confidence . #% We should not be presented with invitations to sample something produced ... #% Various NGOs from inside and outside the Republic of Yemen approached me and my colleagues from time to time with criticism about certain corrupt practices and inefficiencies in the judicial system , about individual human rights abuses sometimes perpetrated by the security forces , and the arbitrary imprisonment of many thousands without due process . #% So I think there has to be a fundamental rethink which encourages enterprise and rewards effort and one which has to deal with , as the honourable Member said , some of the structural problems which exist . #% Despite some populist measures against poverty when he was in government , Mr Thaksin represents the capitalist elite and deceives the masses . #% If we had the chirpiness of your voice in airports when they called for the last passengers to board , I would be grateful ! #% Finally , Taoiseach , why have you come here propositioning us with a dead Constitution that the Irish do not want . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , in a crisis , one sometimes has to act quickly - and it is clear that the eurozone is not out of its crisis - but one also has to act intelligently . #% We have amendments on subjects such as renewable energy sources , energy efficiency , and combined heat and power . #% That also applies to the Azores , I am sure , and to Ireland , though the Azores ' waters are not so rich . #% It is quite interesting that you recognise such potential actually exists . #% The public needs to know , the national parliaments need to know and the European Parliament needs to know the debate that is going on in the Intergovernmental Conference . #% A large number of paragraphs and recommendations from my opinion have been incorporated into the text of the report and I thank Mrs Bauer for her cooperation in that regard . #% Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive . #% Mr President , I would like to join colleagues in expressing my admiration to Commissioner Gradin and to Mrs Waddington for this excellent report . #% No EIA was sought by the authorities on the massive Hilton Hotel project which is planned for the centre of Dublin , even though a revised EU directive adopted by the Environment Ministers in March said that such statements should be prepared for large-scale urban development projects . #% They are now saying that the state will have to pay it back which is not acceptable either . #% I thank the Commissioner for his statement . #% I have no confidence , given the Irish Government 's failure to date , that they will reach the standards set . #% Does it not strike you as strange that they are the countries that do not want to harmonise tax and , in fact , do not want to interfere in other peoples ' taxation systems ? #% How cruelly ironic that a country which threw off the shackles of Stalinist dictatorship only 20 years ago should now revert to aping one of the many crimes of that system : the suppression of the right of people to live freely and in peace according to their own sexual identity . #% I welcome also the statement by the Commissioner that governments will be able to use automatic stabilisers in the context of a slow-down in growth . #% There is a particular need to ensure that people under 18 years of age may only have implants as a medical necessity , and their guardians should also be fully informed of the implications of such operations . #% As far as the environment is concerned , we are a long way off meeting the targets which we set ourselves in Rio . #% While benefits have undoubtedly flowed for farmers , there has been -- as has been said repeatedly this evening -- a greater and real increase in the risk factors . #% Who pressurised you ? #% From an administrative point of view the formalisation is a good thing . #% I have already asked this and you have not seen fit to deliver . #% Furthermore , inept handling of these issues by the respective governments and the EU itself has seriously undermined public confidence in the ability of politicians to deal with crises in the food chain . #% This will strengthen our hand in combatting organized crime and I do hope that the applicant countries will keep pace with us in this regard , not least in the area of dissuasive criminal penalties . #% Suicide rates increase with age . #% In Ireland we have about 2 million acres or 16 % of our agricultural land and our worse land at that . #% As part of the measures proposed by the Commission , animals will have to be identified by electronic transponder or tattoo , and provide evidence that they have been vaccinated and that their immunity has been checked more than six months prior to travel . #% This House and the Commission have a huge responsibility to get the balance right . #% After what Mary O'Rourke our Transport Minister has achieved in the Transport Council , you should be more optimistic about the outcome of the Ecofin meeting . #% Madam President , I have no doubt that the existing arrangements for cooperation in the area of VAT fraud are inadequate in the context of the evolved single market . #% It is a matter of some regret to me that the death rate in Ireland is something over two and a half times the EU average per thousand of population . #% I do not believe that there is a conflict between economic development and sustainable development , nor that we can not put in place an aggressive taxation policy to create employment , to ensure that business and industry can have a competitive environment in which to succeed and prosper , and that does not necessarily lead to the detriment of social protection , or of investment in social services like education , health and infrastructure development . #% deputising for the author . - Mr President , I want to thank the Commission for its reply . #% I would like to ask people to support Mr Hudghton 's amendments , which would actually bring the regulation back to what he originally wanted . #% In a recent policy paper the Irish Government committed itself to reducing landfill and increasing the use of more sustainable means of waste disposal . #% It is important that such an industry thrives . #% If an agreement for a new European Treaty is not reached in or around the time of the next European Council meeting of EU leaders , then agreement may be difficult to reach in the medium term . #% Others are being sold , so I agree with those who say we must not shift the whole responsibility onto the developing world . #% Finally , with the accession of six new Member States between the years 2004 to 2006 , we all collectively have a lot of work to do to ensure that this process is a success . #% We also see the pressures on our urban and rural areas and yet we want to see the benefits of new technology spread right across many of our regional areas . #% I expect the elections next week will result in Hamas being elected and represented . #% Is it because that presidency is afraid of offending the United States by saying something at that country would take offence ? #% The safety and security at the Sellafield plant is as much a matter of concern for the European Union as it is for the Irish and British governments . #% Policy which facilitates relocation thus damages social cohesion . #% Mr President , I welcome this report on organic food and farming . #% The fact is these rules were dismantled by the Commission last year . #% We have succeeded in obtaining many improvements . #% As you mentioned , Commissioner , Parliament 's position was eight hours . #% This year gill netting has been banned in waters deeper than 200 metres . #% The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution and that is something we tend to forget . #% That will not always be possible , but let us have a broader and balanced debate and restore choice for women . #% Indeed , officials from your own office , Commissioner , recently met representatives of the fisheries committee in the Irish Parliament , as well as meeting members of the Committee on Fisheries here in the European Parliament , to discuss the issue of criminal sanctions and administrative sanctions . #% Mr President , I have always accepted the need for a review of the common agricultural policy 's sugar regime , but I object to the total destruction of the sugar industry in my country and in other EU Member States . #% I am confident that , under the Belgian Presidency of the European Union , extensive progress will be made with regard to the enlargement negotiations . #% We want to see this approach taken in the ACP agreements as well . #% Hopefully , the collective will of the young people in particular will be listened to at Gleneagles . #% We also have a limited capacity to use recycled packaging . #% 
It is a nonsense that if a fisherman says something , it must be wrong . #% It is important that we as Europeans say to the Congressional leadership today : ` You do not stand alone . #% To a large extent the problem we face in Iraq is the unfinished business of the Gulf War . #% After the last case and after the slaughter of the last vaccinated animal it is necessary to regain FMD status . #% Some of our political , religious , juridical and police institutions have been implicated in corrupt collusion with this evil . #% The most effective method of achieving a substantial reduction in emissions would be through a European Unionwide CO2 tax . #% I welcome the Council 's determination , together with the Member States , to play a full role under the aegis of the United Nations in a global coalition against terrorism . #% I did not think you would be in Strasbourg today because you did not attend the Duty-Free Intergroup . #% Mr President , the EU Convention comes at a very important moment in the life of the European Union . #% We also want to ensure that multinationals do not dominate in our EU markets . #% We have much to learn from them . #% Tomorrow it will be the Shetland waters . #% I hope that in the years ahead , particularly in the Convention and the subsequent IGC , we can succeed in ensuring that the commitment that began to be developed in Lisbon and subsequently in Nice can be incorporated and deepened in a constitution for the European Union which guarantees that we have not only a competitive Europe but a Europe that cares equally for all of its citizens . #% McKenna report ( A4-3 / 99 ) : #% The opening-up of larger markets will assist in the process of economic growth . #% My primary concern today is to ensure that the channels of communication , which seem to be opening for the first time since the onset of the Limet tragedy , are strengthened and that progress can be made to return the children to their home as soon as possible . #% The full impact of the radioactive fall-out on human health is still being assessed , and I do not believe adequately assessed . #% Secondly , the people who have undertaken courses themselves - whether they be Community employment schemes or vocational training schemes - should be asked how they felt the courses provided responded to their needs and what the long-term prospects were . #% Therefore , in this context , given the wide variation of climatic conditions across Europe , I consider it appropriate that decisions regarding the health and safety of workers from exposure to sunlight are best taken by the national authorities . #% She is following up the work of Members right across the political spectrum including , of course , Mr Mombaur and Mr Robles Piquer . #% It would be good if communism could co-exist with religious beliefs , and people should have the right to express their religious beliefs if they live in a communist country . #% The European Union in its review of the Common Fisheries Policy should take into account the fact that this is a public resource and that a small number of people think they have the right to go out and get rich from it . #% It is therefore frightening that the Commission 's 1996 Annual Report concludes that there were irregularities to the tune of ECU 220 million in the EU 's system of preferential imports . #% If you tackle that you are tackling the socio-economic problems , instead of going at it in the opposite direction . #% The ELDR Group notes the implicit criticism of the Council in its role as one of the two arms of the budgetary authority for failing to give due and proper consideration to critical reports prepared by the European Court of Auditors on tourism policy on the MED and the ECHO Programmes . #% Go for it ! #% Those three areas are of vital importance to people who are involved in cutting-edge technology that we do not know about today but will be using in ten or fifteen years ' time . #% We are committed to limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases to 13 % above our 1990 levels by the year 2010 or so . #% It is essential to manage the potentially high risks of clearing and settlement systems effectively , to ensure the stability of the financial system . #% In my own region , the Greater Manchester Obscene Publications Unit has had success in cracking down on paedophilia with new Internet tracing software . #% Rural society has been on a downward spiral for many years , and you do not need me to rehearse the problems again . #% Mr President , in Europe today , education has increased in importance beyond all recognition . #% In my own country , Ireland , there is no legal local anaesthetic to use on cattle at this point in time . #% The people of Ireland have been totally forthright in their opposition to the existence and expansion of nuclear operations at Sellafield . #% I wonder if Mr Fischler is in a position to consider that farmers should must farm 80 % or more of their land ? #% It is only reasonable that we should seek to establish that this money goes to the farmers and applies to the hectares , as Mr Casaca has suggested . #% I hope that the problem can be resolved as a matter of urgency . #% Should incriminating evidence emerge , it goes without saying that the relevant procedures would be implemented . #% Sadly , not for the first time in history , a war has been won , but the peace lost . #% Mr President , thank you for allowing my question and thanks to the President-in-Office for his answer , even though he has stated that it is a non-answer . #% We must all be on the watch for that . #% There is no room for complacency when it comes to the issue of combating HIV and AIDS . #% No Khmer Rouge leaders has ever been tried and only two are in detention , one being the person who ran a notorious torture centre in Phnom Penh from which only seven out of more than fourteen thousand inmates emerged alive . #% European leaders , especially the British Government , can help to restore some balance in relations between Britain and the rest of Europe by agreeing on a framework for resolving the BSE problem at the summit . #% I welcome this new Community programme , which brings together four previous programmes and seeks to streamline them and to provide more money for their implementation . #% Passports are now obligatory for all horses and contain a new annex for recording of veterinary treatments . #% Is the President-in-Office aware that failure to address the issue of promoting a quality sustainable EU wool sector is to concede the European wool industry to our competitors , New Zealand and Australia ? #% We have a mountain to climb , but I am confident that the people in Ireland and the rest of Europe will rise to the challenge when they are given the chance . #% The EU must insist on an independent inquiry and we must take action that will ensure that , if we are refused that , it will have implications for the relationship between Uzbekistan and the European Union . #% Current budget lines already in place for this project are easily sufficient to bring about its completion , yet - true to form - the suggestion is to spend even more . #% On behalf of the thousands of beef producers I want to appeal to the Commission and the British Government to act together to pay more attention to the real scientists and less to the biased commentators who are continuously getting it wrong . #% I fully support the need for adequate , flexible maternity leave , but I believe it is for the elected UK Government to decide , with an input from parents and their employers , how much our own economy can afford to give and how a maternity package is to be delivered . #% The Irish are saying here today that this is a great victory as the Spanish have been kept out ! #% The EU Commission recognises the importance of this industry and the fact that certain agricultural products , including sugar , could be used for producing bioethanol . #% I voted for a fair statute for all Members which must go hand in hand with a fair , honest and open expenses regime . #% Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , Commissioner , I represent a country which has a unique and close historical relationship with the United States . #% Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control . #% This type of action is nothing short of criminal and must therefore be dealt with by criminal sanctions . #% Was it purely technical , to comply with your obligation to revert to Parliament by 30 June , even though you are a couple of months late ? #% If the Commission 's original Erika package had been implemented , single-hulled tankers like the Prestige would have been replaced by 2002 . #% We are told that it is best left to the Member States to deal with these matters . #% While we are evaluating the added value of the Fund within the process of the 2007-2013 multiannual framework budget review , this should , in my opinion , be an ongoing process , and we need to be vigilant in the area . #% I was genuinely disappointed that these issues were not addressed during the Dublin Summit . #% If the principle of additionality is not rigorously enforced and independently verified , it makes it very difficult for European Union institutions and national EU governments to ensure that the competitive position of those regions most in need is improved . #% We are presenting conflicting messages and proposals to the people of the candidate countries . #% Our reaction must be to do all that we can to prevent the sort of widespread slaughter , injury and chaos we saw in the United States . #% 
Does it matter ? #% It is an indication of a serious rethink about Europe across the continent . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , I welcome Ms Fraga EstÃ©vez 's report , and particularly her highlighting of concerns on this proposal from the Commission , as I have serious reservations about the Commissioner 's proposals to adopt a maximum sustainable yield ( MSY ) model as the reference point for managing fish stocks . #% Is it in order for my colleague to accuse those who are in support of duty-free as unscrupulous , when all they are trying to do is preserve jobs , ensure lower airfares , promote tourism and the retention of essential ferry services . #% It is clear that a peaceful outcome to the current crisis is still possible . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Adam for this exceptional report . #% In conclusion , I would urge that all future political cooperation with Malaysia be conditional upon the Malaysian Government 's abolition of the Internal Security Act and also the release of all political prisoners , so that all Malaysians may be assured that their basic human rights as enshrined in their constitution are respected . #% If we catch 3 million tonnes of fish for industrial purposes in the European Union annually , with 7.5 % to 8 % of that being by-catches of edible fish , then that represents a quarter of a million tonnes of a commodity that is scarce in the European Union , when we are only 48 % self-sufficient . #% I call on the Commission to state clearly that it will not tolerate such pressure and that it will rigorously defend the existing agreement . #% Going forward , Parliament and the Commission must always keep an eye on how Member States are implementing this one . #% I understand and respect the arguments of those who say that the European Parliament has no competence or right to make such a demand . #% We have , as General Morrillon suggests , to ` share the burden ' also . #% She obviously listened during the debates in the committee on her report and has incorporated many of the ideas which came up . #% Nuclear materials are currently clearly not secure and not safe . #% We must defend those rights . #% Here I congratulate the Commission for taking the European Council at its word and bringing forward with extraordinary speed a comprehensive measure to freeze the assets of terrorist organisations . #% If the EU is to act as one in the future then the force must be an EU one with components from all Member States who wish to participate , and operating on the initiative and under the political control of the EU . #% A more balanced economic policy mix is required . #% It deals with the psychological effects that has on those children as they grow older . #% Perhaps the wording is not as bad as it was originally . #% We must look at the whole issue of arms production in the first place . #% That greater urgency has been recognised in the Council suggestion that we should have an intergovernmental conference beginning next year , something which we subscribe to . #% But what does the Commission do ? #% However , that choice must fully respect the choices made by other states to be nuclear-free . #% Frequently farms have been able to revert to short-term measures such as foregoing necessary capital investment on farms . #% Mr President , I commend Mr Liese for his dedicated work on this very sensitive and technical subject . #% It is extremely unsatisfactory , in parliamentary terms , to find ourselves so late in the year and with so little time to consider this matter , to be bounced into a position which , in effect , represents a fait accompli . #% I do not object to trade with China , but I do object to the lack of compulsion upon them to reduce their emissions . #% We know the people of Europe want high-quality public services , we know they want them at an affordable price and they want them delivered universally . #% In all our peace initiatives , we must be constantly aware that , for the perpetrators of terror , peace is a threat that they will resist with all their might because peace will mean eventual conviction in the war crimes courts . #% One success story in recent years has been the growth of the salmon production sector . #% Yes , we in Ireland have made rapid progress towards the EU average in GDP but - yes - we still need new significant levels of funding for the period ahead if we are to consolidate our economic progress achieved to date . #% We must encourage that intelligence and creativity by having infrastructure , training and everything else . #% In fact , as I am talking to you , I have just heard of gossip - and let ' s hope that is all it is - of sheep in Wexford , my own constituency , having been identified and being incinerated as we talk . #% Parliament has to accept that EMU is going to proceed according to the timetable . #% What is going on here is neoliberalism , which is very similar to neocolonialism , and it is being done with the help of the Brazilian Government . #% A Commission declaration attached to the new DCI will contain , also for the first time , the benchmark that the Committee on Development has been using since 2003 to promote increased focus on the key MDG sectors of basic education and basic health , and the Commission has never before accepted the Committee 's 20 % benchmark for these sectors , which has been accepted on this occasion . #% Mr President , it is very hard to believe that since the historic meetings in Aqaba on 4 June 2003 , 65 people have now been killed in what is a horrifying escalation of violence in the region . #% I want to reassure her that people are interested in the environment but they are not interested in paying for the improvements we all want to see . #% I am a patron of an organisation in Ireland called Women 's Aid . #% The disabled remain forgotten . #% I welcome the fact that European Union is prepared to play an active role in third-party monitoring operations in the Middle East and I believe that the European Union must and should play a stronger role in any future talks that may take place in the Middle East region . #% Mr President , I wish to ask you to raise urgently with the United Kingdom Government the issue of its failure to properly and fully carry out its obligations under the Euratom Treaty and European directives on nuclear safety . #% The French Government is being extremely cynical in this case by having their own lawyers advise the fishermen on a case which the French Government itself knows will fail . #% The conciliation compromise was welcomed by the three institutions , by myself , by my European Parliament colleagues , by Minister PrÃ¶ll , on behalf of the European Council , and by the Environment Commissioner , Mr Dimas . #% I would like to highlight the scandal of the complete disregard of energy efficiency by the authorities concerned with building European Union establishments . #% However , I have to say that in committee we had 275 amendments to this report and we managed to bring it through with virtually no amendments . #% Structured dialogue only takes place with the associated states . #% For example , we have had an announcement from Dublin that there are going to be bigger , larger and better boats . #% When Parliament adopted the Services Directive , those of us who were concerned about its impact on workers ' rights were assured that the proper enforcement of the Posting of Workers Directive would deal with our concerns . #% Mr President , much work has been achieved in recent weeks to accelerate the enlargement process , but a number of difficulties have to be overcome before EU enlargement becomes a practical reality . #% It will take generations for the people of Haiti to fully recover from what will hopefully be a once in a lifetime event . #% EU companies will be able to buy up Chilean fish quotas on fully exploited fish stocks ; they will also have free access rights to Chile 's under-exploited fisheries resources . #% In 2002 , 60 % of Irish farm incomes were in the form of direct payments to producers which qualify for ` bluebox ' exemption . #% It is essential that the applicant countries put into place the body of EU law already adopted to fight organized crime across Europe . #% We need strategies that look to the positive facet of that ageing population , to the experience that they have ; but also strategies that are realistic in seeing that people are being denied opportunities to access the new labour market . #% Therefore , I fail to understand or accept the linkage that is trying to be established through this resolution . #% And yet that sector has been ignored for far too long . #% This is the strongest defence against relocation and in favour of strengthening the regions that need that help most . #% However , I would like to stress that state aid rules should not be used to block Ireland or any other Member State from competing against non-EU countries for important foreign direct investment . #% In terms of legislative logic you need to take the general regulation first , even though that involves only assent , and take the regulations thereafter . #% Could I ask those who seek to heighten fears about bioterrorism to recognise the reality of terrorism . #% I regret that the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy did not draw up an opinion on Mr Katiforis ' s report - it should have done . #% Surely an Europe which strives to be a Continental power , proud of its economic progress and intellectual capital should not be afraid to acknowledge its spiritual dimension , a dimension which will lend us strength as we work towards peace and security . #% These are very important issues for the continuing development and growth of the European Union . #% In Ireland we need time now to reflect upon this result in a calm and reasoned manner . #% 
Both of them have public deficits that are well beyond the limits agreed under the criteria . #% But let us begin a renewed , an improved , deeper relationship and one that will not crumble as the last one did . #% In other words , there is a certain discrepancy between national growth and regional cohesion . #% I hope that when a similar situation arises following the next intergovernmental conference , our procedures are changed to facilitate such a vote . #% Have we ever had a resolution before us which was so clear in terms of the abuses that we are seeking to have addressed by the European Union ? #% Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it . #% I have considerable sympathy for the workers at BNFL let down by a sloppy management . #% A subsequent Israeli commission of enquiry concluded that he bore responsibility , as they put it ' having disregarded the danger of acts of vengeance ? #% I will mention just two . #% From my dealings with the office , I have found that they aid the Irish citizens thoroughly and professionally and by voting in favour for the passing of this report , it shows the faith I have in the office . #% We are looking forward to seeing his analysis of the results of the consultation . #% The very existence of systems for the indiscriminate interception of communications is a violation of Article 6 of the EU Treaty , as the Commissioner himself has recognised . #% Mr President , a few weeks ago in Parliament we voted on the Maat report on the welfare of animals during transport . #% We also have a recent RPII report , which I would recommend the Commission to study . #% The situation in the Irish Box will remain unchanged for 10 years , despite the fact that it is recognised that there is a crisis . #% Gaza is isolated enough without cutting off accurate media reporting . #% in writing . - I welcome the European Court of Auditors ' 2006 Annual Report as it identifies welcome improvements , particularly in relation to agricultural spending . #% Of course , it has happened time and time again and we must do something to try and control this . #% The four-month time frame that we have in Parliament at second reading did not allow a proper teasing-out of exactly what was in the Commission 's mind . #% Does the Commissioner have an understanding with Member States that they will not top up their vehicle taxation as a means of recovering income lost as a result of lower prices , thereby wiping out the economic benefit to consumers ? #% Surely it should have been the other way around . #% However , it might be possible to contain an H5N1 outbreak at its source , if the surrounding population were immediately vaccinated . #% We must ensure , however , that we bring men , particularly young men , into this debate . #% Before this ban is lifted again , Commissioner , I would like your assurance that you will do everything to ensure that our veterinary inspection in the Far East where the outbreaks took place is of the highest quality , and we accept no excuses . #% But before we embark on such a radical decision , we should look at the history , particularly in the United States , of the relationship between security authorities and public figures and recognise that we could overstep the mark by giving such powers to OLAF . #% The European Parliament resolution further calls on the EU countries which are members of the ILO to adopt these instruments at the ILO conference in June 2011 and calls on the EU Member States to ratify and implement the convention and recommendation quickly . #% Mr President , if we support the social dimension of the European Union , we must give it practical expression by giving priority to the protection of the health and safety of workers . #% Are farmers ' incomes such that they can afford to call out a vet when in doubt and have the European Commission and the national responses been adequate to the challenge ? #% We must work together to ensure that their quality of life is dramatically improved , sooner rather than later . #% We require strengthened monitoring and a reinforcement of current eradication measures . #% I regret that the Commission , from the outset , has chosen the political box option . #% Finally , the elimination of transaction costs is good news for the Irish tourism industry as the costs of travel and the costs of holidays are greatly reduced . #% At short notice , I have agreed to try and say a few words on his behalf in relation to this most important topic . #% In particular , a situation where , as a result of market design , allowance prices significantly exceeded the long-run marginal cost of abatement within the EU and approached the penalty price would be unsustainable . #% They have been living in exile now for almost 30 years . #% We do not recognise Moroccan sovereignty there and so Morocco has no right whatsoever to discuss access to EU vessels there , nor for that matter has the EU any right to enter into such negotiations with Morocco or to allow EU flag vessels to go there as has happened in the past . #% It lies there , a graphic symbol , perhaps , of our sterile role in the Middle East process . #% This should also apply to the coast waters of the Irish Sea which are already dangerously polluted with radioactive waste . #% There will be more detailed financial provisions : the financial provisions of the proposal were another area of very serious concern for the Committee , as they were extremely general and very far from the level of detail to which Parliament , as part of the budgetary authority , was accustomed . #% In Brussels , there is a Members ' bar - as is traditional in parliaments throughout the European Union . #% In this age , in Ireland and across the European Union , we have major health challenges to tackle : cardiovascular disease , neuropsychiatric disorders , cancer , digestive diseases , respiratory diseases , sense organ disorders , obesity and diabetes , to mention a few . #% There must be a speedy ratification by the Union 's Member States of the United Nations Convention for the suppressing of the financing of terrorism . #% If anything , the European Union has proven , over its 50 years of existence , that it is the best possible peace process that can be seen , because it is based on dialogue , mutual respect , understanding , tolerance -- not acceptance -- of all different ideas . #% They can not afford childcare or care for elderly parents . #% Is this another aspect of the policy of non-cooperation ? #% We need to know exactly what is going on . #% There is no intention to build a lot more nuclear power stations . #% We can work together and we can be very careful when we consider building , or indeed retaining , a potential target . #% So it is not an isolated concept , but part of an ongoing debate which will be pursued to some extent in Cancun next week . #% The illicit trafficking and transfer of young players across borders is a worrying issue . #% I very much recommend that you take on board the physiological function which unfortunately the rapporteur - and I do not agree with her - asked to be excluded from the report . #% The European Union has been a bulwark against recession in the past . #% Because the new technologies which have been brought forward do offer new opportunities for communications and for greater interaction of people with disabilities and the wider community that should be encouraged and given at a lower rate . #% I want to sound a note of caution . #% We will achieve a cohesive Union but we must be responsible in our attitude to the whole question of what is intentionally fraudulent and what are simply mistakes and errors that can not , in the short term , be avoided . #% It must also be made clear that the illegal movement of sheep by unscrupulous operators will not be tolerated . #% When you look at the health effects of tobacco and smoking it is quite clear that the number of people who die as a result of tobacco is very high . #% Farmers , especially those in major exporting areas such as Ireland , have suffered tremendous losses . #% The EEAS represents yet another example of wasted taxpayer 's money , for a service my constituents do not want but have forced upon them by bureaucrats who seek to squeeze more and more power away from national governments towards the EU . #% But what we hear are words and more words of support instead of actions on the ground . #% The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament , as other speakers remarked yesterday , can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission . #% It is true that we urgently need to peel back regulation and that China is investing threefold in research and innovation . #% I now enter the world of science fiction and explain that to be energy-efficient , computers must go to sleep , but they must wake up instantly when they are required to do so . #% The Lisbon Treaty strengthened cohesion policy and thus , it is in all our interests that the future cohesion policy stimulates the development potential of the entire EU , encourages greater competitiveness of the European economy , and improves the quality of our lives . #% Last July , before the present tragedy came to light I urged Parliament in Strasbourg to hold a full and open discussion on violence against children in the autumn . #% I favour a substantial strengthening of EU-Saudi relations and urge the EU institutions to increase our presence in the region . #% 
rapporteur . - Mr President , I should just like to bring to the attention of the House a technical amendment that we should make pursuant to Rule 155 . #% Mr President , on behalf of Mrs Theorin , who initiated this resolution , and my Group I would ask all Members to support it . #% I hope these can help move the process forward and that this lobbying will encourage the US to review its isolationist position on Kyoto . #% Madam President , I rise to welcome this report which attempts to orchestrate some basic harmonies in a rather chaotic symphony . #% Mr President , the anti-European camp wants the constitutional ratification process to be discontinued . #% By 2050 , this will need to be reduced to 1 or 2 tonnes of carbon . #% It is really important that we deal with this issue because of the increasing popularity of homeopathic products in particular and of natural and alternative medicine in general . #% In relation to the coexistence issue , this is a myth . #% Madam President , as we will have a statement on Bosnia tomorrow , we wish to withdraw the objection . #% The main problem with this approach is that it assumes that consumers first read the small print in such contracts and , even if they do , that they fully understand the implications of agreeing to forego the right to sue in their own courts and the differences in relation to costs incurred , legal systems , the choice of language used and so on . #% Madam President , we need to wage a concerted war on drugs . #% To vote in favour of the Stauner report is to vote for postponement of granting discharge which , all things considered , we believe should be granted now . #% We must draw a line under that and we must make sure that during the lifetime of the next Parliament and during the mandate of the Prodi Commission we actually bring about the reality of the first enlargement to the East . #% I submitted a statement in writing at that time on the issue of Mordechai Vanunu , who was released from jail in Israel yesterday after 18 years ' imprisonment . #% Using waste for renewable energies , recycling some other types of waste and incineration are among those that have been mentioned . #% These regions have very major tourist potential , but they suffer because of lack of comparable access . #% A number of things have been mentioned . #% We want to ensure interoperability to enable computer programmers to engage in reverse engineering practices and to decompile programs for experimental purposes without risking infringement or legal action . #% A couple of years ago we took away the possibility of extending assistance to people in such instances in the European Union . #% There is cause for grave concern . #% I had requested an explanation of vote for the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party on two reports . #% Of course alternative regulation is a subject of much scepticism . #% I do not think we have ever put our heads together to decide exactly what we mean by it . #% The conflict must end . #% I should like to express my thanks to the Commissioner . #% In addition , questions about the distortion of the market , particularly in regard to plant construction , have been raised . #% It is therefore crucial to ensure that measures are put in place to protect those suffering multiple discriminations . #% It is also important that we learn from mistakes made in the programmes in the past . #% As tax havens and off-shores deprive developing countries of multiples of the amounts raised through ODA , inaction in this field is unacceptable . #% With regard to rural tourism , there is a need to link projects together for the purposes of marketing and promotion in order to create a critical mass , and it is essential to decentralise tourism functions to the regions . #% Madam President , the Republic of Vietnam is in the process of transition , as we all know . #% However , my political conviction is reinforced that whatever happens in the Court of Justice , which we must respect , the Intergovernmental Conference must change the rules for social policy to avoid being taken hostage by individual states . #% Because of illegal actions by the few , there is a growing public perception that collectively fishermen are all potential criminals . #% Mr President , the Danish presidency set itself an extremely ambitious agenda for the Copenhagen Summit . #% In fact , relations visiting or trying to visit these prisoners have been subjected to intimidation . #% The technology for chemical weapons flowed to Baghdad . #% Following the visit by Mrs d'Ancona on a personal basis , I would ask you to intervene with the new British Home Secretary to give her bail so that she can return home with her child , as evidence of the compassion that Tony Blair and the Socialists promised in this particular case during the election . #% Community rules , at the present time , do not allow for a higher Community participation . #% Cancellation of 80 % of Iraqi debt is certainly something to be welcomed . #% Vacancies in Ireland , for example , include : accounts assistants , building administrators and sales and reservations . #% We are in fact going backwards after seven years of trying to meet climate change commitments : this is not only unacceptable , it is completely scandalous . #% There are consultation groups and citizens ' groups ; if you had put a group outside Pilate 's palace they still would have told you to free Barabas . #% I would argue that sustainable development and employment are part and parcel of the social dimension of the European Union . #% I particularly welcome the possibility of a European constitution as a possible outcome . #% In his report , Stephen has mentioned his concerns with regard to the common position ; I share some of those concerns . #% Amendment No 28 by the PSE Group , the Verts/ALE Group and the GUE/NGL Group and others can not be misinterpreted : '' ... users who produce , acquire and/or possess drugs for personal use and users who supply drugs to others without the intention of making a profit are excluded from the scope of this framework decision . '' #% This has to stop . #% Let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements . #% in writing . - I support this resolution on the proposed International Labour Organisation convention on domestic workers . #% New rules are necessary for many reasons : scientific progress in the last decade , new elements such as carbon sinks , the transboundary nature of gas emissions and the obvious need for a Community approach and the harmonisation of rules in this area . #% We also have to examine ourselves . #% In other words , as the European Environment Agency has told us , we need consistency and transparency in reporting on greenhouse gas emissions . #% But it is not just an issue of closed borders . #% While we acknowledge the need to continue to concentrate our resources on the poorest and declining areas , some of which are in my own region Merseyside , we still have to have solidarity as a two-way process . #% Scientists differ in their interpretation of the impact , if any , of BSE on public health . #% Where is the justification for this directive ? #% People should be extremely wary of political promises . #% I want to acknowledge , Mr Spring , your own personal efforts in trying to establish reconciliation in Northern Ireland , often in very difficult circumstances . #% In particular , I am pleased with the recommendation that any mandatory changes be introduced gradually and requiring an initial transitional period , in order to allow sufficient time for the industry , and especially individual fishermen , to cope with the extra expense in an already difficult industry . #% It is very clear that the European Parliament does not have the power to dismiss a judge at the Court of Justice . #% I welcome the Commission 's initiative in proposing ways to boost our tourist industry , which is an industry able to make a major contribution to local , regional and national economies . #% You can do better . #% I believe that the farm-to-table principle has now become a core principle which underpins all regulation in the food and feed area . #% I agree with the rapporteur that as the single biggest donor we would like to see the Commission fly the flag more often . #% The future of waste disposal must not and can not lie in the continued search for more landfill up and down the length and breadth of our country . #% This proposal is profoundly flawed , in that it is based on the old-fashioned research which relies on RDAs of vitamins and minerals . #% 
It is incorrect and it is wrong . #% They are very influential with fans and they can have a hugely positive impact on getting people to stop that kind of behaviour . #% Unless we have proper measurements then it is impossible to monitor the effectiveness of control programmes or the full extent of the threat from global warming to ` future generations ' . #% A ` Swiss cheese ' Palestinian State on the West Bank , with the Israelis controlling the cheese and the Palestinians controlling the holes , will not work and will not deliver peace to Israel in the long term . #% Indeed , as Mr Tappin rightly points out , small and medium-sized industries naturally tend to be the norm in smaller countries . #% Nobody but a fantasist would suggest such a thing . #% There are obligations on financial institutions within the Union to substantially reduce the cost to consumers of transferring money from one euro-zone to the other . #% My colleague has already mentioned this . #% In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense , without any real negotiation or discussion . #% Trade coupled with aid and debt relief is essential to the achievement of the 2015 Millennium Goals so concrete results with regard to the development aspects of the Doha Round need to be achieved during the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference . #% I hope that you will use your voice to teach the lessons to be learned from the former Yugoslavia . #% I absolutely reject the assertion that levelling up tax in the direction of harmonisation , can offer any solution to the un-competitiveness of Europe . #% I express in particular my grave disappointment at Amendment No 27 in the name of Mrs Green and Mr Cot , who removed Article 1 from the Rothley report and ipso facto removed from it the possibility of the Liberal amendment . #% That is important to recognise . #% Equally , European Union leaders are right to call on Israel to withdraw its military forces , stop extra-judicial executions , lift closures and restrictions on the Palestinian people , free settlements and end operations directed against Palestinian infrastructure . #% This House and the spring summit have been ignored . #% To date the European Union has given ECU 150 million , as people have said , and has involved itself with more than 3 , 000 projects . #% I have referred constituency cases to the SOLVIT network and have been impressed with how the issues have been handled and with the prompt responses to our questions . #% This is not the case for all countries in Europe at this time and that is why I welcome the efforts of the Finnish Government to pursue the adoption of a strategy on the Western Balkans at the forthcoming Helsinki Summit . #% Even if he assures this House that the funding will be used for the non-nuclear components of KEDO , the transfer of such technology is now so evidently dangerous that a complete review of KEDO , deleting the nuclear technology transfers , is necessary . #% This type of programme is an inspiration to what can be done for rural areas by fully exploiting new technologies . #% For this reason local authorities strongly support EU leadership to ensure cross-European commitment by national governments to give funding and legislative support in this field . #% The imminent reform of the CAP gives us a real opportunity to address these issues . #% This is very timely , when new information technologies are ensuring that small , medium and large enterprises within the Union will now have to change their administrative structures . #% All I want us to do is to meet our commitment to these people . #% . -- Mr President , North Korea has one of the world 's most repressive regimes . #% It would bring home very strongly the idea that there is a benefit to being a European and being part of the European process . #% That is a precedent we have to be careful of . #% I challenge her to do so , but instead I fear we will hear the usual Sinn FÃ©in empty , pious , weasel words that reek of insincerity , with hypocrisy dripping from every syllable . #% The present system , whereby there is at least one Commissioner from each Member State , has worked well in the past and should be maintained . #% The European Ecumenical Commission for Church and Society says : ' We are still deeply dissatisfied with this directive . #% But , I believe and many people within the neutral countries believe that when further decisions are taken , eventually the mutual defence commitment will be applied . #% So it is here , with the rapporteur trying to require all sites -- regardless of size , product and complexity -- to comply with all articles . #% There are many things that need to be attended to . #% Some time ago we debated about giving the rights to artists who sell their artwork . #% Issues surrounding the external effects of the CAP will be dealt with in the context of the Doha round of the World Trade Organisation talks . #% Nevertheless , although it is relatively modest , it is welcome . #% This was senseless and a terrible tragedy for his family , friends and colleagues from the church . #% Without a clearer definition of what is meant by this , the Green Group can not support the report . #% Mr President , I welcome a tough policy to restrict the use of pesticides . #% The criteria for inclusion on the EMAS register are very stringent . #% If consumer confidence is to be restored , Britain must implement an eradication programme that will leave no doubts in the minds of consumers . #% I welcome the cooperation you have outlined and the special attention which will be given to nuclear installations . #% Mr President , the news in recent weeks that initiatives to clone human beings are taking place in different parts of the world is very disturbing indeed . #% Colleagues should be aware that if they vote in favour of Amendment 2 , they are voting in favour of adding Friday sittings to the Strasbourg calendar next year . #% These rules will form a blueprint that can be followed in the event of any new scientific information being made available or if more radical action is required . #% The Commission has proposed a number of progressive changes in the current technical measures including square mesh panel , increase in mesh size , grates or grids to filter out the shrimp catches and others . #% Mr President , I am sorry to hear that the Commissioner is ill this evening . #% Very often this fear of the loss of a child results in an abduction . #% The European fleet has shrunk . #% However , I could not take on board the second part because to me it would be an undue interference in the internal affairs of the Maltese people . #% Like many of my colleagues I am interested in the impact on clubs in the north-west of England , which is , after all , the home of football . #% However , I believe it is important for our own Commissioner for Sport , Mr FigeÄ¾ , the Finnish Presidency , the EU and the European Parliament to look carefully over the coming months at how we can highlight this unfortunate trend . #% The second meeting of the EU-Icelandic Joint Parliamentary Committee will take place in ReykjavÃ­k on 26 and 27 April . #% Negotiations can only begin when Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria . #% I would urge international donors to continue to make sufficient funds available to permit the running of the camps during the negotiation and the verification process . #% The European Union must ensure that the interests of each individual citizen are protected at all times . #% Live animal exports are a hugely important , legitimate business for Ireland . #% There is no reason why animal protection can not be a legitimate reason for adopting trade restrictive measures . #% Madam President , unfortunately I was chairing my group meeting when my question came up . #% Out of 15 amendments tabled in second reading , compromises were reached on 11 . #% I would like to know whether this text genuinely reflects Parliament 's views , particularly the amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and whether the Commission would be kind enough to read out that text so that we can see what we are agreeing to vote on . #% The Commission must also demonstrate to us that cooperation between service providers and copyright holders will not impinge on citizens ' fundamental rights , especially the right to privacy , the right to freedom of expression and the right to due process . #% Is it just to suit two DGs which could not come up with a cooperative proposal ? #% The European Parliament 's legal opinion stated categorically that an unevenly weighted dual legal base , as in the common position , is legally unsound and will be struck down by the ECJ . #% However , I would like to see progress in a number of other areas : #% 
The Commission must take this into consideration and be much more reasonable . #% I think one of the biggest dangers that we face for the future is that we have failed our citizens and failed our people in terms of telling them exactly how successful Europe has been , how good it has been for them not only in peace , stability and prosperity , but also in bringing about political stability , in ensuring equality between men and women , in guaranteeing minimum rights for workers , minimum rights for people who are most in need and most at risk within our societies . #% Agreements are for the honourable ; the Janjaweed are not honourable . #% In relation to discards , this is also completely unacceptable . #% These people are often the victims of great discrimination on our territory and pursuant to this legislation , third-country nationals will be able to move within the EU with the same guarantees when it comes to their social security entitlements as EU nationals . #% This Treaty brings the EU closer to its citizens . #% These countries -- for years many of them locked in the iron grip of Moscow -- have joined the most unique and successful experiment in the history of democratic politics . #% From this table , you will see that , although there has been an overall increase over previous protocols , there has been a reduction for a number of stocks . #% I am encouraged that there are some developments and possibly we will get some breakthrough . #% I might just mention that , for example , for a long number of years , as Mr Crowley knows well , coming from a part of Ireland which has often had maritime disasters , there has been cooperation between the RAF and the Irish Air Corps . #% In Ireland at the present time there are 14 000 apprentices of which about 11 400 are in the new system of standard-based apprenticeship and roughly 2 600 in the old system which was time-based . #% We need to look in a serious way at the decriminalisation of cannabis , and to get serious about serious drugs . #% It secures jobs and ensures cooperation with the third world and the Mediterranean in particular . #% Therefore Member states are encouraged to reprogramme their Structural Funds Operational Programmes in order to devote a better balance to energy efficiency investments , including where they fund social housing . #% In my own region , north-west England , trading standards intellectual property groups ' seizures of counterfeited pirate goods is on the increase . #% There is no public acceptance either in my country or in many others of deep-level storage . #% The public has lost confidence in the national and European food safety systems after the scandals and scares with beef , E.coli , lysteria , salmonella , dioxins , eggs , poultry , milk and hormones . #% This report has come forward now that we are on the threshold of achieving our objective and it is entirely timely to ask what should be the external purpose of and role of the euro . #% We took a risk at the last enlargement by admitting three new members before any significant institutional reforms were in place to deal with the consequences of expanded membership . #% While the market is becoming bigger , Agenda 2000 does not give us any more of a strategy than we had in the MacSharry reform to exploit these expanding markets and maintain the long-term viability of European agriculture . #% Madam President , the objective of the International Fund for Ireland to break the vicious circle of violence in Northern Ireland by contributing to peace and reconciliation is more important than ever at the moment . #% However , I would just like to remind colleagues that they can smoke in comfort and away from everybody else in the designated area over there to the right at the window . #% In particular , I have been concerned about the lack of accountability of EU-based companies trading in the UK which are able to advertise in the UK , but do not need to apply for a licence . #% I am very disappointed at the result of this referendum in Ireland but I fully respect the outcome of this democratic process . #% Many colleagues have already spoken with regard to the detail of what is contained in these reports and our aspirations for the future . #% The United Nations estimates that the modern slave trade is now worth GBP 5 billion and 10 % of illegal entrants to Europe come via the Balkan route . #% I agree with the rapporteur , and I pay tribute to him here for his interest tonight , that it is vital to ensure proper coordination between the fund 's activities and those financed under Community structural policies . #% Each national standards authority carries out a comprehensive and full review of all the activities of a prospective applicant under the EMAS scheme that may affect the environment . #% Unfortunately the preferential tariff arrangements enable goods to be imported into the EU from under-developed nations , either duty-free or at a reduced rate . #% Animal welfare organisations have been contacting my office and welcoming the law . #% If we had a policy of maintaining proper prices , then lower quotas would be much more acceptable in the fishing regions . #% If the Police Service of Northern Ireland is unable to bring a prosecution , the EU could grant a financial contribution from the budget line for aid for the victims of terrorism to assist the McCartney family to mount civil proceedings in its search for the truth . #% The existence of internment-without-trial camps in Guantanamo Bay has to unacceptable to anyone in a civilised society . #% My real point of order is this : I strongly deplore the fact that , while Mr Le Pen was speaking in this Chamber , the French National Front waved the Irish flag beside him . #% Why should a business have to apply to join a local chamber of commerce , only to be told there is a five-year waiting list ? #% That was an enormous misinterpretation by the Iraqis and they suffered the consequence . #% Regardless of third countries , can we even call our own EU countries safe countries ? #% It is impossible to operate . #% I deem it wholly inappropriate that the Committee on Budgetary Control should question the effectiveness of the IFI funding system . #% In particular , as we look to move forward and create a new environment for the creation of new jobs and new opportunities for people within the European Union , we believe that going back over old policies which have failed and rejuvenating them under a new name will not work . #% I support the Commission ' s framework programme to combat trafficking in human beings ; the aim is to develop effective judicial cooperation across the European Union . #% We have provided OLAF to further investigate suspected problems . #% We need sometimes to temper Utopian environmental demands with business reality . #% Investment schemes will cover Farm Waste Management , Improvement in Dairy Hygiene Standards and Housing and Handling Facilities for Alternative Enterprises . #% First , the link between hunger and climate change . #% If , as I fear , they show a dramatic improvement in Ireland 's economic performance , is there not a real danger that a major part of the newly designated Objective 1 region will no longer qualify ? #% It happens to us all . #% This is an interesting development . #% The FIFG is due to continue until 2006 and so there are several years in which these reforms could bring some sort of positive effect . #% Mr President , I too have companies in my constituency that are benefiting from this public procurement regime . #% The largest part of the budget , of course , goes to fund the common agricultural policy , and this is an important community measure which must not be undermined . #% As a result of the problem of mutual recognition of qualifications , many months passed before I was able to take up my position . #% I appeal for urgent aid in that regard . #% But , of course , if the Commission , representing all of us in ensuring that this agreement is put into good effect , does not have any resources to do it with , then we are back to the original situation as far as the Member States are concerned . #% The work in the European Parliament has undoubtedly increased because of the Treaty of Lisbon . #% It is therefore an extremely important responsibility of your presidency to ensure that the documentation of the Intergovernmental Conference is made available in public , as well as all responses to that documentation . #% Mr President , the final report before us today , which was adopted unanimously by the temporary committee , represents the fruits of a most thorough investigation and consultation process , including numerous public hearings and visits to affected areas . #% This Convention is dated 1983 . #% Madam President , I want to refer to your expression of sympathy with the people of France who are affected by severe flooding . #% Israel claims that its invasion of Jenin and other areas was an attempt to destroy the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure . #% If a Member State , or a group of Member States , wishes to follow the best practices of another Member State , then so be it . #% Tourism is also a major linchpin in the economy of Ireland . #% The onus is on the European Union to tackle the pollution which is causing health problems and which could be avoided . #% We are a continent comprising many small countries with different traditions . #% Diabetes is a good example of a disease that is under-funded in my wealthy constituency . #% We have a multi-pronged approach , we spend millions and millions on research into renewable energy . #% 
Those parties which seek to legitimise and promote racism and discrimination through the ballot box , and we have examples in many countries , should take note of this directive and incorporate the recommendations and its legal force in their own constitutions . #% On the back of the new directives which are being enacted in the telecom sector , the European Union will catch up with the US sooner rather than later . #% In all cases , it is essential that we act on the principle of favouring the citizen . #% Many farmers lost crops , animals and even their homes . #% As the Rapporteur on EU-ETS , I am aware , as I hope we all are , of the need to act and act promptly if we hope to solve this challenge . #% We hope that what happened in East Timor , after the UN persuaded the people to go out and exercise their right to vote and they were subsequently persecuted and murdered by the Indonesians , will not happen when the people in Western Sahara vote . #% As was agreed last December , and has already been mentioned here , it is imperative that Burundi enacts a stable and real cease-fire between government and rebels as a precursor to a meaningful and lasting peace . #% I should like to thank the rapporteur for grasping the importance of the information technologies in reducing the environmental burden of development actions , for example by reducing the need for mobility or the need for transport infrastructures . #% Mr President , like other speakers , I think it is deplorable that nothing has happened since Parliament 's Echelon report . #% He may have overstated our generosity , but that was a stinging indictment of the EU 's attitude to countries such as this . #% The Treaty of Nice allows a core group of Member States to form an elite inner circle . #% I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work . #% We need to bring protection and production together in the management of our forests in order to ensure the viability of their environmental , social and economic functions . #% It is obvious to most people in this House that a race to the bottom in any area will not win the allegiance , or indeed build the confidence of European citizens in the European project . #% When framing legislation we have an obligation to ensure that legislation is effective , that it can be easily enforced and that it does not impose an onerous burden on employees or enterprises . #% Emphasis , in the future , must be put on quality , while in my time limitless quantities were needed . #% The worst thing you can say about that settlement is that it was made on a legal basis which was not in effect when the crime was committed , but was in effect while the case was still open . #% First of all , I congratulate the Presidency-in-Office for the work that has been carried out in organising the coordination between the Member States of the peacekeeping group that is going to Lebanon . #% There is a need for more extensive research on the causes of breast cancer , in particular on the effects of hazardous chemicals and the environmental pollution , nutrition , lifestyle and genetic factors . #% Ireland has a particular interest , but so do the French , as do all of us in the 15 Member States and beyond . #% Emphasis is placed by Parliament on the need to respect the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and to protect against fears of bio-piracy in respect of the underdeveloped world and the environment , and these two are important obligations which can not be set aside . #% I think Mobutu and his coterie of thugs and gangsters who are running that country , drinking pink champagne while their 44 million people have no education , no schools , no health , no hospitals are a disgrace . #% I should like the Commission 's view on that . #% I am also somewhat surprised that the last speaker seems ignorant of the fact that there are different provisions in the Republic of Ireland and that it has been granted an extension and deferment until the end of 2011 . #% I would urge you , Commissioner Byrne , to give serious consideration to the establishment of an independent food agency along these lines . #% The programme would also attempt to promote consumer rights to information , to education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests . #% A quarter of a million tonnes of edible fish being used for animal feed is excessive . #% Some of the rapporteur 's conclusions are very disturbing . #% It parades a fictitious commitment to neutrality while allowing US army planes to use Shannon airport despite the clear condemnation by the Irish people of the action in which these planes are engaged . #% It was reported last week that operations at the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant may cease sooner rather than later . #% This directive has been a great catalyst : it has pulled us up short to look at what we mean by our culture and to put a value on it that perhaps was lacking in many of our other deliberations . #% It is important that something happens as a result of this recommendation , that there is some sort of legal framework . #% I also found that there were certain human rights problems . #% Mr President , I refer to an administrative change that has been made in Parliament , which comes to me as news . #% The difficulty is that everyone has some justification for taking action , but there is no acceptable justification for displacing tens of thousands of innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians . #% People do not want to be presented with an array of competing post offices marketing their products . #% Unfortunately , it is the highest within this age group in the EU . #% Antimicrobial resistance can be transmitted from humans to animals and vice versa . #% On behalf of our Group , and Mrs Lenz who unfortunately can not be here , I rise to express our total support for this resolution . #% Fair Trade 's significant worldwide growth in 2005 also shows that more and more producers , traders and suppliers trust the Fair Trade certificate mark and like to join the system . #% In the Commission 's revised proposal , diplomatically referred to as the Council 's compromise - the one we are not being consulted on - the biologically sensitive nature of the Irish Box is back . #% I am calling on the British government to make a full statement on the matter . #% Those of us in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are in the Chamber today are more accustomed to debating agricultural matters at midnight . #% This demonstrates the wide extent and influence of EU fleets . #% Parliament 's role must be a constructive one . #% In a recent case in the UK , an eleven-month trial running into millions of pounds was replaced and resolved by mediation in a matter of days . #% Indeed , as a result of the Amsterdam Treaty the European Parliament has the power of codecision with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations in the area of consumer protection and public health . #% However , there is still a lot of uncertainty concerning the security measures in airports . #% I signed in and I voted in a roll-call vote but my name is not there . #% So we must make the investment , not only in records and inventories , but also in gene banking and conservation of what still remains . #% On our crumbling school buildings ? #% There is a lot of mythology about what is safe and what is not safe . #% I deprecate the installation of nuclear power in some countries where the culture and the requirements for such potentially dangerous forms of energy are not available . #% The amendments will ensure that legislators keep control over strategic decisions concerning funding allocations and sectoral priorities . #% Mutual health organisations are not intended to take the place of the state ; rather , they offer an alternative , enabling the obstacles to health care access to be overcome and providing improved access to quality health care for all citizens regardless of their income . #% ` Softly , softly ' conciliation is merely banked by the terrorists , who then demand more and more . #% Secondly , the European Union should use all its weight in highlighting this crisis at the meeting of the UN Security Council in Nairobi . #% The outbreak demonstrated without question that the European Union 's FMD risk-management policy , and the risk assessment on which that was based , needed to be reviewed . #% Therefore , we support what is in the agreement but will not be voting for amendments to the joint resolution . #% In the European Parliament , I wish to applaud the positive and supportive role of the European Union in this process . #% The Black Sea strategy must be based on the uniqueness of the area . #% I have to declare a personal interest in this matter . #% Funding from Daphne has had a positive impact on the work of many Irish women 's groups . #% This is an unacceptable situation which must be brought to an end . #% It is inappropriate for Members to try with this resolution to rewrite regulations which were agreed unanimously by this Parliament and will be up for review in 2006 . #% The locked-box or locked-store system must apply to the manufacturer and on the farm where the feed is to be stored and used . #% 
Mr President , I should like to speak on behalf of the Fianna FÃ¡il Members of the European Parliament , all our constituents and indeed the 99.9 % of the Irish people who would like to be associated with your remarks on the atrocity committed by the Irish Republican Army in Manchester . #% Routine post-mortem examinations are carried out by veterinary surgeons employed by the Department on all animals slaughtered . #% They will not cooperate . #% Animal welfare is an area that concerns all in the sector . #% We are not doing anything whatsoever about it . #% The artificial divide which has existed in Europe since the end of World War II has now come to an end and the peoples of east and west Europe have now come together freely as a community of 25 countries , working together with the common interests of promoting economic prosperity , democracy and the rule of law . #% It behoves us , as politicians , not to be raising fears and using terms which alarm people . #% The rights of consumers must be of paramount consideration for the European Commission and the European Parliament at all times . #% The fact is that this is a world in which the response to natural disasters and to man-made problems clearly requires transnational governance . #% Mr President , the debate is just about over and the scientific jury is largely agreed on the impact of greenhouse gases on our climate . #% So , while the Portuguese Government has no monopoly on truth , it has competence , which it considers was threatened . #% I ask you please to consult with the European Central Bank and European Investment Bank and try to bring your influence to bear to get us back to traditional bank managers who engage with SMEs and help them to develop their businesses . #% In his submissions and hearings with our group he spoke about his role as an honest broker . #% Seventy countries are dealt with in this report , where we shine a light on human rights abuses . #% That nuclear installation on the west coast of Britain , far from the cosy seat of power in London , has been and remains a cause of serious concern to Irish citizens . #% The European Union has consistently supported the principles of democracy and the protection of human rights . #% The whole question then of human rights sanctions was also considered by the Reflection Group . #% I therefore especially welcome his statement today . #% Perhaps the President-in-Office might consider how best we can help to bridge the gap that needs to be bridged , particularly in relation to the Palestinian issue and the lack of progress that has been made there . #% In addition , the annual TACs were decided . #% This is a new low and I am sure I speak for all Members in condemning this atrocity . #% Often he has contacted Europe Direct with questions only to find that it is the SOLVIT staff that have the technical and legal expertise to answer the questions that the public and his citizens need answered . #% The Commission is talking about the health of the European public , not delivering public health services . #% From the perspective of my political group , cohesion and solidarity is our objective and we believe that it is severely undermined by chronic unemployment . #% By the time it takes to discuss this topic , almost one thousand people will have died of hunger somewhere in the world - the majority of them in Africa . #% We witnessed an act of war - without a declaration of war - by persons , movements or states , as yet , not fully determined , but who acted with a grim and focused determination . #% A review of the first year of the code is due in March 2007 and this will assist us in making decisions about the effectiveness or otherwise of such codes . #% So , let us try for that . #% The original paragraph 5 referred to an ` Australian proposal to list the Great White Shark in CITES Appendix II with a zero quota ' . #% That is a particular problem in Ireland . #% This would seem to be a very good opportunity to get one state at least to be more cooperative with international legal norms . #% They have agreed for now not to fight each other and to engage in dialogue for peace and reconciliation . #% We wish to indicate our vote that this legal remedy should have a place in European law . #% That is why we , as Socialists , have asked for the European Parliament to be associated with the anti-dumping investigation , for Parliament to have a role in terms of transparency and accountability , and not for the Commission to take unaccountable decisions counter to subsidiarity . #% In particular I would like to reiterate the concerns of my fellow Irish citizens regarding the Sellafield-THORP plant . #% I have some questions to ask the Commissioner , one of which is very specific . #% As we are on the brink of agreeing the Services Directive , we are well aware of the need for Member States to fulfil their Treaty obligations under Article 49 as regards the free movement of services . #% Only peaceful negotiations carried out in an atmosphere of mutual respect will bring about progress . #% There is a question of economic credibility at play here . #% This latter issue is one very important matter which must be given urgent political consideration . #% If the European project does not have the support of the people of Europe it will not succeed , and the Commission is failing to recognise this . #% Can I ask you for one assurance , one guarantee at least , that when your proposals finally come before us , you will not allow the sale of quotas across national borders ? #% We can not pursue design criteria , as distinct from performance criteria , which favour one jet engine manufacturer over another . #% The Commission 's first triennial report on cohesion policies and their impact has been an essential part of the evaluation reflection on future priorities for cohesion policies . #% What will happen to the system today that is geared into decommissioning fishing boats when we no longer receive Objective 1 funds ? #% That is why monies must always be put aside for the development of youth facilities in disadvantaged areas that suffer from drug abuse or which are likely to suffer from drug abuse in the future . #% Madam President , I do not wish to delay proceedings but having heard both speakers before me with regard to the problems associated with the amendments and so on , I propose to the House that we refer this report back to the committee until such time as they come up with a proper text that we can all accept . #% There are a lot more important areas into which EU resources could be going , rather than this : it is clearly in the interests of the military . #% If actions like this continue , either on the part of an individual Member State or a group of them , the EU 's common foreign and security policy will be in tatters , despite the best efforts of Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana . #% This should be the major pillar on which this new Commission is judged . #% In the area of environmental impact assessments Ireland has taken a minimalist approach . #% I would like to congratulate the decision of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association to accept a timetable to cut CO2 emissions in new cars by 25 % by the year 2000 . #% I want to say , on behalf of my own group , that although you find yourself in an extremely difficult personal position , you have behaved with honour personally , as President of this House , from the very first moment this issue was placed before you . #% There must be an organised and negotiated handover of responsibility to the Palestinian Authority . #% Releasing political prisoners , ending torture , subjecting the security forces to the rule of law , respecting the rights of the Kurdish minority and other measures relating to the Copenhagen criteria are sure steps to securing the date for accession negotiations . #% I thank my colleague , Mr RÃ¼big , for an excellent report . #% The report we are discussing today seeks to extend qualified majority voting to all legislative activities except those of a constitutional nature . #% One of the reasons why , particularly in our inner cities and in our more disadvantaged areas , people turn to drugs is because of the old saying ` the devil finds work for idle hands ' . #% I hope that when we come to deal with the matter in the House tomorrow the Verheugen incident will have simply served as a timely reminder that we must get our signals clear and avoid giving mixed messages with regard to this strategic priority . #% The tuna would be caught in the way that is acceptable to us and the French and Irish and British would not have to sustain any losses . #% If we have to , let us set standards somewhere down the road longer-term . #% Consumers are understandably concerned and confused . #% If we want to encourage people to stay in farming - in particular young people - we must not turn farming into a career that is more to do with mountains of paperwork than producing food and taking care of the land . #% One of the key elements we in the European Union must focus on is our relationship with the countries to the east of the existing European Union borders . #% So , for us it is not only important for the environment but economically we can develop our forests into something very important . #% Firstly , Mr President , I should like to congratulate you on your election and wish you every success during your term of office . #% 
I congratulate Mr Davies on his excellent report . #% This compromise resolution makes it very clear that much more needs to be done , especially in relation to our understanding of other cultures and religions . #% I support the view of the Commission ' s relationship with Parliament being akin to that of a government ' s relationship with its parliament . #% It is also time that the obstacles to the implementation of the Mitchell report were removed . #% Let us recall that last January this House voted unanimously a resolution calling on Iraq , as a minimum , to provide answers to the Red Cross as to the whereabouts of the missing Kuwaitis for which there is documented evidence . #% I encourage other Member States to follow suit . #% The case for energy efficiency is clear and unanswerable . #% Pioneering work in adult education was carried out by Professor Jim Phelan of UCD , Dr Michael Ward of UCC , Professor Michael Cuddy of UCG and Dr Ted Fleming of Maynooth . #% However there are environmental implications which we have not taken very seriously . #% Equally , the transportation of nuclear materials via the Irish Sea sends shivers down the spine of many people living in Ireland . #% Mr President , 20 years ago an eminent health pathologist warned that she had never examined a cancerous tumour that did not have chemicals from the benzene family in the active reproducing cancer cells . #% It is a national organisation which has benefited greatly from the Daphne programme . #% I also welcome the expansion of the directive to include other sectors such as the chemical and aluminium sectors . #% In Berlin we did not foresee that we were going to have a foot-and-mouth crisis and we did not foresee the BSE crisis either . #% Do we want a vibrant , living , well-maintained countryside or do we want a giant national park without people - and especially without young people ? #% They spread with increasing ease around the world as a result of population movements and the expansion of trade . #% These are not my words but the words of children and young people from my country , Ireland , and other EU countries . #% We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly . #% In short , we should not be revisiting the same old problems when we have this debate . #% In my opinion this is a more reasonable and pragmatic way forward , but critically it is workable and achievable . #% I listened to the Commissioner with interest . #% We also need to insist -- rather than simply recommending -- that Member States ensure people know that this card is available , that they know how to apply for it , how it can be used and what their rights will be . #% This time , in the United Kingdom and elsewhere , many of the headline writers point to the fight to save duty-free sales . #% Could we take the vote on my group 's amendments first ? #% I departed only once from that list : to show support for what was available . #% I see no justification for this added requirement and therefore hope to see an exemption granted . #% I entirely agree with his analysis of the situation . #% Their priorities are many but there is no doubt of the one area that we all agree on is for the need to create jobs . #% I welcome the amendments tabled by Mr Ford and Mr Swoboda , which strengthen the resolution . #% . Mr President , I would like to thank the author of the oral question and Mrs Attwooll for presenting it , particularly as she is missing her group 's Christmas party this evening by being here , which shows her true dedication . #% But I wish to conclude by reassuring the honourable Member of our understanding and sympathy towards the problems she expresses . #% I suggest to the Commission , as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement , to present a document , that explains the value of enlargement , not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense ; a document , like the Cecchini report before the Single Act , that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand , historic challenge facing Europe today . #% Mr President , thank you for allowing me to intervene at this point ; I realise there are a lot of votes to get through . #% Perhaps he could suggest ways of improving that , especially in the months ahead when , near Christmas , we decide what the TACs and quotas are for those areas and are bound to face grave difficulties . #% Mr President , funding for rural development is a key issue . #% I would urge the Commissioner to take it on board as a proposal . #% If the Commission would - as we have requested for years - have an independent nuclear inspectorate look into the Sellafield operation , they would have found this out some years ago . #% Unlike the assertions from some speakers in this House today , this is not telling people what to do or how to think ; it is giving our citizens a choice . #% Any possible change to these rules must be fair and equal to all participants . #% That strengthened enormously the will for peace among the people . #% Peat power plants work very well indeed in my country and make an important contribution to Ireland ' s energy supply . #% This reserve accumulates resources across a number of budget categories . #% Mr President , I have to say that I am shocked by the Council statement here today that not a single body of the Council has made any effort whatsoever to reach a common position in relation to our stance in the World Bank , or indeed to use the clout we clearly have financially and in voting terms on the World Bank ; despite the fact that every Head of State recently signed up solemnly to the European Constitution , which declares that we want to end world poverty , and despite the fact that each Member State has signed up to the Millennium Development Goals . #% Is it not rather odd that it takes until the end of the HELIOS programme before an assessment is made ? #% We should remember that this initiative is part of a package which aims to stimulate failing European economies . #% Yet it remains an absolute disgrace that this man has not yet been brought to justice . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Development for the support they have given to this report . #% A properly resourced European Maritime Safety Agency would enable such coordination with due respect for the need to safeguard the subsidiarity principle in recognition that primary responsibility must lie with coastal Member States . #% The five children involved were supposed to be returned to their parents on Monday , but have not been as yet . #% Mr President , in the presence of Commissioner McCreevy and his colleagues , I would like to put down a marker about the Commission 's proposed reform of the sugar regime . #% This is a part of our problem . #% This being the purpose of this report , I congratulate its rapporteur , Mr Deva . #% I would say to the Commission that it is not myself , the rapporteur or any Members in this House with an interest in fisheries , but rather the fishermen who are out there working , trying to make a living and trying to survive in very difficult circumstances who need convincing of the need for this . #% Whatever the cost , it is not in the interests of the European Union that the family farms which are central to the European agricultural model are fast becoming marginalised . #% This is a sector with a wealth of potential for expansion , for growth in the economy , for research and innovation and for tackling climate change . #% I am pleased to hear from the Commissioner for Information Technology Erkki Liikanen that the number of broadband connections doubled from 9 million in July 2002 to 17.5 million in July 2003 . #% The recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are major problems with this business , such as over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs . #% I have two final points . #% We have to find a middle ground between those who see a need for a unipolar world and those who see the need for a multipolar world . #% Will the President-in-Office of the Council ensure that this matter is placed on the agenda for further consideration by the Spanish Presidency ? #% Their interests were not being best served in the talks that have gone on to date . #% We need to create trust but , until these new systems are in place , there is no reason why consumers should not enjoy the same rights on-line as they do offline . #% The other thing the Indonesians have to realise is that we need people to have access to East Timor . #% They can be bestowed selectively , denied , or even take back . #% The temporary protection period is limited to the time during which the conditions in their country of origin do not allow a safe return of those caught up in the conflicts . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mrs Stihler on her report which deals with the Commission proposal to regulate the recovery of cod and hake stocks . #% 
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and can not be too sweeping , otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed . #% ( The President urged the speaker to conclude ) I am sorry , Mr President , but I am sure you , unlike the Council , can allow a few moments for the disabled and less well-off in our society . #% They have the responsibility and the duty to jump together . #% On my first day in Parliament the good wishes and support of the Irish Members of the European Parliament are particularly welcome and have been a great source of help to me . #% I welcome Commissioner McCreevy 's undertaking to propose a separate directive on patient mobility and the whole issue of cross-border health service provision . #% Those ultimately responsible for supplying the illegal drugs now available in communities throughout the Union have long operated on an international basis and effective action to curb their activities also demands a coordinated international response . #% The longer an incident is allowed to go unchecked the wider the impact , as we have seen . #% We have learned an expensive lesson but one that marked an important turning-point in EU food production and one from which we can benefit in the long term . #% If we had good statistics , we would be able to deal with a problem like that before it arose . #% Mr President , my primary observation has to be that the proposed structural and cohesion funding package for 2007-2013 fails to provide adequately for those regions within the EU-15 which , though themselves deficient in infrastructure investment , failed because of the national criteria to qualify for cohesion funds . #% Can we do some kind of regulatory impact assessment before we go down the line ? #% Mr President , as in the case of many EU harmonising proposals there is a certain simplistic and plausible appeal to mutual recognition of criminal convictions throughout the Community . #% The reality is that social Europe has been very much a ` frill ' or an ` add-on ' to the broader game plan of this Union . #% A new report , which is both timely and in terms of content deeply worrying , has been prepared for the European Parliament . #% In recent weeks a number of positive indicators have suggested an increased willingness on the part of Member States to agree a workable compromise . #% The establishment of an area of freedom , justice and security confers on members of the judiciary an essential role to play in the effective workings of the Union . #% The conclusions of the Tampere European Council certainly present strong political support for reaffirming the Union 's wish to overcome difficulties with regard to prosecuting all forms of cross-border crime . #% I do not believe that our current difficulties over our divided response to the Iraq crisis should give rise to pessimism and paralysis . #% It is a new means by which to organise the activities of mankind . #% A qualified doctor tried for a number of years to register as a doctor in Spain . #% This in turn will send out a positive message from the European Union that it is actually supporting measures which promote air travel at a competitive price and help the consumers of Europe . #% My latest visit indicated that the peace process there is incredibly fragile , but people take tremendous heart from the fact that Europe is supporting their cause . #% I would very much like to support this report . #% I do not think that any national government would apologise for having taken in too much revenue . #% I will speak briefly about each of the reports . #% The criteria mentioned in Article 290 are compulsory if they are fulfilled . #% It is entirely appropriate at this stage that the European Parliament does not express a definitive view on the qualities of the Treaty of Nice , because we recognise - as the Treaty itself does - that more needs to be done . #% The Nitrates Directive has been mentioned . #% Therefore , in the light of these discussions , I wish to take some time to highlight a potential approach that my group will be taking during the reform process . #% As one who has served on this committee in this parliamentary term , I believe that , because it deals directly with citizens , it has a great role to play in reducing what I discussed in a school in Ireland yesterday , the so-called democratic deficit . #% With the liberalization of the whole air transport sector , it is imperative that we have common standards on training and licensing of cabin crews throughout the Union . #% I also believe that the Commission must not shy away from playing its role as a full partner merely because some Member States are claiming the monopoly on subsidiarity . #% We must ensure that the EU responds urgently and effectively to potential crisis situations and thereby helps prevent the recurrence of the sort of tragedies that we have recently experienced in East Timor . #% I congratulate him on a very balanced and informative report , notwithstanding the slightly odd decision to link these two topics -- hedge funds and derivatives -- in a single report , as trade in derivatives is already far more regulated in the EU than the area of hedge funds . #% I believe that the inability of the European Union to react to the tragedy with the same single-mindedness as the United States , which sent its Secretary of State , is a clear indication of the urgent need for an EU foreign minister . #% The Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland has reported that nearly half of all organised crime groups are involved in IP crime . #% I am not surprised by the statistic which indicates that there has been a decline in the number of women participating in employers ' organisations . #% The same is true of the single currency . #% If we carry on with the Commission 's GM coexistence policy , organic farms will inevitably be contaminated . #% EU studies have shown that one woman in five has suffered violence at the hands of her male partner , and that 25 % of all violent crime reported in Europe involves a man assaulting his wife or partner . #% I am referring to the controversial hushkits legislation , an example of how not to do something . #% There will be many solutions in front of us at that time . #% There is plenty of money to resolve the problem for the next two years and following that we can still have that 1.27 % which I hope will finance enlargement . #% Madam President , it is very simple . #% I have checked with many of the patients ' groups who are alleged to be opposing this directive , and they have told me absolutely categorically that their names were used without their consent . #% President-in-Office , I should like to point out , in relation to health , that one of the big issues with alcohol consumption is its link to youth suicide . #% We sometimes feel helpless as individuals against this massive global challenge but , at the end of the day , people need to be encouraged to do their bit , as little contributions such as the ` Power of One ' do add up . #% This solidarity is something we must inject into this debate , as Europeans , with greater vigour and not simply leave it to local or national interests to make the case . #% In Ireland , as elsewhere , violence against women is a very significant problem , with statistics from different reports indicating that one in four women have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime . #% However in relation to the 6 dates he mentioned on RTEs liveline programmes , he was inaccurate in at least half of them . #% Quite often , for example , supermarket goods are wrapped several times . #% Are they not concerned ? #% Secondly , where incentives are given to entrepreneurs and to businesses to invest in new jobs , in new infrastructure and in research and development , giving a longer-lasting guarantee to the creation of manufacturing in other service jobs . #% I have one disagreement with my colleagues Mr Andrews and Mr Gallagher about the generosity and special merits of the people of Ireland . #% In March , the Guardian newspaper wrote that Miss McAliskey 's case illustrated how prisoners awaiting extradition or deportation hearings could find themselves treated worse than those who had been convicted . #% Finally , the directive should also be extended to cover the proceeds of fraud against the EU budget . #% I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Schlyter , for his excellent cooperative work on this report . #% The proposals will also lead to a conflict with other goals with regard to the regulation of traffic to reduce congestion and other impacts . #% Secondly , I wanted the Commission to indicate the share of investment per mode of transport in the framework of the Structural Funds programme period 2000 to 2006 . #% We have moved a long way from that and , while Mr Casaca rightly points out the risks involved in policing export refunds , we are today spending only around four or five per cent - approximately EUR two billion - on export refunds , and we welcome that development . #% In the circumstances of the peace process there is no justification for this , or in any other circumstances for that matter . #% We have an internal market , we have a single European currency and the European Union is shortly to increase in size to 25 Member States . #% Let us hope that this is not another such occasion . #% Given the traditions of the Swedish people , this is obviously an area very close to their hearts . #% Mr President , we need to look at where the light weapons are actually coming from . #% Several times in this House I have protested about this totally unacceptable invasion of our system , which has no place here and is causing serious problems for Members . #% 
To do that of course requires greater urgency in modernising the democracy of the Union . #% Whatever institutional and other changes take place , there will never be real progress unless and until all Member States act and speak as one . #% The report also recognises , and rightly so , that education and training should be prioritised in the funding proposed and I believe that the allocation of resources to the development of human capital is vital for long-term investment in the Union 's future . #% It is essential that adequate transition arrangements be put in place for regions such as my country , Ireland , which cease to meet Objective 1 qualifying criteria . #% That is deplorable . #% Particular attention must be given to the needs of small , isolated coastal communities that rely exclusively on fish . #% The proposals of the Irish presidency under the title ` Outline for a draft revision of the Treaties ' are the distillation of views and opinions gathered from a myriad of discussions , debate and seminars at political and official level with academics , NGOs and social partners , a process that began under the Italian presidency and gathered momentum during the last six months . #% Women are universally under-represented where decisions are made . #% Finally , I welcome the amendment respecting the principle of subsidiarity , which in this case gives legal certainty to Member States to opt out of the use of certain ethically controversial cells . #% We must today take the bold step of voting this law onto the statute book . #% Mr President , not for the first time in this House I have the opportunity to express concern with regard to the safety of nuclear installations , and in particular those with an established record of poor management , since they put the lives and health of millions of citizens at risk . #% The common theme running through them all is the effect that the excessive amount of fishing capacity has on European fisheries . #% We are suffering widespread climate instability because of that failure . #% The reaction from the citizens of Europe and other parts of the world has been absolutely outstanding : people have really shown their humanity to the people affected . #% I remember that when the Berlin Wall came down an African leader lamented the fact that the European Union had now turned to the East like a man looking at a gorgeous new girl that had appeared and Africa was going to be forgotten and left on the shelf . #% Everyone tells us that with Solvency II life will be great in the future , but it will not be unless we get the regulations right . #% As far as aeronautics is concerned , I am glad that there will be some attention to the health of passengers . #% I think both of them not only take credit for themselves but indeed bring credit to this Parliament for the way in which they have carried out that duty . #% The resolution before us today calls for renewal of EU measures when they expire on 20 February and the introduction of tough new sanctions . #% The EU 15 will not meet their current Kyoto targets on CO2 emissions reduction and nothing will be done about that . #% This not only undermines the founding principles of NEPAD and the ACP-EU relationship , but also means that major problems burdening Africa -- external debt , AIDS , food security , conflict prevention , good governance and human rights -- can not be properly addressed . #% Prime Minister Barak has also vowed to end his reign of occupation of Southern Lebanon within a year . #% The percentage of people outside the families who work in the industry is very small indeed . #% If this is our only answer to the EU 's unemployment problem , we have a long way to go before launching any kind of humane policy . #% All political parties , the social partners and other interested parties will be represented on this forum , which is expected to begin its work very shortly . #% Not only do I condemn the actions of suicide bombers , I also condemn the actions of the security services of the Israeli state when they act outside international law , making the resolution of that problem even more intractable . #% In China , with a population of 1 1/2 billion , the scale of the problem is different , but China has made enormous progress on the economic side . #% The facts are sobering . #% Again , we have commented on the recurrence of the same problem in the 2001 budget . #% I have often said it is important that we as a European Union should not just make regulations telling people what they may or may not do , but that we should extend what appears to the European public and to the regions of the Union to be tangible benefits . #% Let me say that we wish you a Happy Christmas , but also a very prosperous and politically active New Year . #% I believe that any alternative to that would handicap the development of the sector , which has significant commercial potential . #% This is of the utmost importance . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer and also to wish him well for the Swedish Presidency . #% It is regrettable that some Member States are now advocating a reduction in the size of the EU budget . #% Mrs Wallis has failed to provide compelling evidence of the need for an optional instrument . #% It is important in this context that the SAVE initiatives should be coordinated with other European Union energy initiatives such as THERMIE and SYNERGY . #% There have already been disastrous floods in Portugal , Spain , Somalia and Mexico this year . #% I will come straight to the point I have difficulty with , and I support completely what colleagues - in particular Mr Bowis - have said . #% This has never been more obvious than it is at present . #% Finally , to Alan Johnston 's family and friends , I express my sincere support on behalf of the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament . #% They want a Europe that is based on human values , based firmly on universal rights . #% High Representative , we wish you every success in this task . #% I agree with my group that the main competence needs to remain with the individual Member States , not because I want to suggest that we keep immigrants out of the country , but so that we can begin seriously to address the chaotic situation that exists in many of our countries regarding the processing and acceptance of immigrants . #% The actions of the Israeli army are simply disproportionate and this is a view that is shared by Kofi Annan , the EU foreign ministers and many more . #% Would they have invested if they had been aware of the undisclosed liabilities ? #% You have won the respect of this Parliament during the period of time that you served as Vice-President and the many roles that you had to fulfil . #% The basic aim of the strategy is to reduce the impacts of pesticides on human health and the environment . #% If we are going to have access to third countries -- which is probably needed -- it must be closely monitored and there must be tighter controls . #% I believe both the EU and Member State Governments must further tighten and control the overall operation of the genetic research area and , in particular , the implementation of programmes that do not fully conform to established ethical , environmental and consumer guidelines . #% However , I agree with the rapporteur that their management and application must be simplified . #% The overall financial assistance from the Union to the states which comprise the former Republic of Yugoslavia now amounts to EUR 475 million . #% In conclusion , mechanically propelled vehicles have become weapons of mass destruction on our roads and we have become somewhat immune to that destruction . #% It is important to recognise , however , that while this is a very welcome step , it is a small amount compared with the cost to the world if these diseases are left unchecked . #% We can not continue like this , because it is undermining the credibility of the overall EMU framework . #% Military action without UN approval will increase antagonisms between the West and the Muslim world ; it will inflame the Middle East and it will deal a devastating blow , not only to the credibility of the UN , but also to the future potential of the European Union Common and Foreign Security Policy . #% The Commission 's scientific committee on animal health and animal welfare concluded that levels of animal welfare drop as journey times increase . #% I said this last month . #% The reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is used inappropriately in the report . #% It is equally important to ensure that similar bi-partisanship exists in its Sri Lankan counterpart . #% Mr President , in the spring of next year there will be a referendum in Ireland to decide whether or not to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty . #% Organized crime is emerging as one of the major problems in many countries . #% On behalf of my Group , I then supported proposals for EUR 30 - a figure which I believe is the very minimum necessary to close the gap and help restore profitability to the sector . #% There is a failure of implementation , not a failure of regulation . #% I believe these moves should be highly praised and that this is the way we should proceed as well . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the Commissioner is telling us that the Memorandum of Understanding was drawn up under Article 122 , part 2 . #% 
If we could agree on those two questions , we would have an amicable solution to all the other questions that arise . #% It is ludicrous to suggest that it is not causing injury . #% We have no choice , Mr Prodi . #% I would like to keep the date and I can accept the fallback as an addition to the text , if that meets with the approval of the House . #% We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed , the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems . #% There must be no unilateral approach . #% Under the original regulation , Article 31 EAEC ( which focuses on the group of persons who might be subject to radioactive contamination ) was considered the most appropriate legal basis as Article 168 TFEU ( which regulates public health ) did not exist . #% Energy saving and the rational use of energy must be part of our strategy for security of supply . #% But I also believe that we have a responsibility to seek to improve the draft directive presented to us , a view shared unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% We constantly obstruct their path towards enjoying a full human existence . #% I also said that this raising of the ceiling would be accompanied by a further effort to redeploy the available appropriations within Heading 3 to help the sectors concerned , allowing an increase in the total available funds of ECU 1.2 billion . #% One of the great weaknesses of the past has been a lack of efficient enforcement and member countries aiding and abetting that . #% In the course of preparing my report I did a great deal of research ; I took it extremely seriously . #% But by lowering the intensity without changing the objective , Milosevic knows that a village a day is keeping the West away . #% Earlier this year the European Council in Cologne decided to establish a chapter for fundamental rights which will bring together in one comprehensive document all the fundamental rights applicable at European Union level in order to make these rights more visible to its citizens . #% The position the Committee on Foreign Affairs puts forward in this resolution under my name is the appropriate benchmark for judging how much progress has been made . #% Their action or lack of action has led to an understandable but justified consumer resistance with beef consumption at one point dropping by 27 % . #% If Member States make commitments to implement the matters which affect life and death than we have to find ways of ensuring that they comply with those commitments . #% Last year , this Parliament roundly condemned Sinn FÃ©in -- the IRA -- for its continuing criminal activities . #% The Convention recognises that any State has the right to ban imports into its territory of foreign spent fuel and radioactive waste . #% It must now sit down with the Commission and examine the eradication programme and adopt a set of measures to eradicate BSE and restore consumer confidence . #% Mr President , I am very glad to participate in this debate , mainly to give a voice to the many children , young adults with handicaps and those living in inappropriate state institutions in Romania , which I visited recently . #% So I welcome this adoption of an ICAO balanced approach to air traffic noise reduction as it amounts to a fundamental system change for the European Union . #% Most importantly of all , however , because we value Russia as a partner for future developments , we should call on Russia to take the proper steps to ensure that the rights of all European Union Member States are respected equally - whether large or small , whether a neighbouring country or not , whether a former dominion or not . #% The key question these days is not so much one of technology itself but how technology is used in a way which contributes to growth through improved productivity . #% It does not make any sense . #% Procedures for establishing Houses of Europe in all Member States are under way . #% President al-Bashir continues to oppose Phase 3 of the present UN Plan which allows the AU mission to be bolstered by more than 20 000 UN peacekeeping troops . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I support what Mr Van Orden said . #% The EU needs to show its commitment to the Irish people , including the people of Carlow and Kilkenny , by fast-tracking these relief funds . #% To do so would tie the hands of the industry at a time when , for example , my country Ireland , as an agricultural exporting nation , must become increasingly competitive . #% Madam President , firstly let me thank Mr Prodi for this initiative today . #% For example , I know that the Commission is required to keep Parliament informed of the enlargement negotiations to enable it to express its views in good time through appropriate parliamentary procedures . #% As regards organs , Parliament has accepted that this directive is not the appropriate place in which to deal with organ transplants . #% I also stressed the need for prevention . #% An under-financed Union can not be successful . #% We in the EU must respond to this problem as a matter of urgency . #% European Union taxpayers have to subsidize heavily something that the vast majority of them are opposed to . #% It is frustrating that the United States through its present stance is becoming much more part of the problem than part of the solution . #% Without that we would not have had this result , which I trust will bring forward a directive that will work . #% Today , what we are talking about , to put it simply , is the ownership of ideas . #% I have to say that , expressions of concern apart , there do not appear to be any concrete proposals . #% SMEs that are inventors argue that without patent protection they are in no position to negotiate with big business or protect themselves from larger companies ripping off their inventions . #% You have demonstrated the potential in the world of a small , vibrant and - I remind you - still neutral nation . #% Finally , the bottom line in terms of protectionism is that we have to protect the rights of citizens , whether they are inside or outside the European Union . #% It has not been an easy job to construct an EU-China report , because there are a multitude of factors that have needed to be considered . #% We need proper studies that are independent and will give us the whole story and it is the responsibility of the Commission to carry that out . #% I congratulate Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , the rapporteur , and Commissioner Busquin , both of whom have realised the importance of this gap . #% Those who have called for this to happen should think about what they have now succeeded in achieving . #% I certainly hope that with the passing of the Europol Convention we will now see greater cooperation under the third pillar . #% I think this is something that could be expanded upon , throughout Europe , because schools offer a unique opportunity to educate this very venerable road user group . #% I think the Fusion Programme has to be re-examined . #% The budget must match our ambitions . #% This historic process will have a positive impact for the actual cohesion of the European Union itself . #% But having said this , as parliamentarians , we should exercise fully and vigilantly our right to scrutinise the outcomes of comitology meetings and to hold the Commission to account when their standing committee experts ' decisions exceed the powers conferred on them by the TSE regulation . #% This issue was discussed at length prior to the Amsterdam Summit and , in my view , the correct position was taken by the Heads of State and of Government to maintain the present practice whereby each country has the right to nominate a Commissioner . #% Hence the conciliation procedure which you , Mr President , were involved in . #% Even in countries such as the UK , where the EU programmes have funded some of the most important coastal zone management and regeneration projects , local authorities are unable to give priority to funding integrated coastal zone management actions because of the absence of a national policy framework , statutory duties , responsibilities or adequate funding . #% Let us grasp the opportunities that have been given to Romania and Bulgaria today , but , most importantly of all , let us grasp the opportunities which have been given to the European Union to act as a beacon of hope , of democracy , of freedom , of respect for human rights , across the world . #% As an Irish MEP , I am pleased to have the opportunity to thank the EU for its continuing support for peace and IFI funding . #% Extensive production of greenhouse gases is resulting in the depletion of the ozone layer which , in turn , is resulting in higher sea levels , contributing to greater coastal erosion , greater flooding and the elimination of many of our island communities . #% One of the excuses the minister has given is that there is a dip in the roads and the types of buses available in London would not possibly be suitable . #% Mr President , the resolution that we have before us today is not intended in any way to criticise the key actors namely the Bhutanese or Nepalese Governments in the process of finding a solution for the 96 000 Nepalese speaking Bhutanese refugees living in the camps . #% We have seen the success of rural development programmes , including the LEADER scheme and other such activities which have helped create much needed employment in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas throughout Europe . #% The air transport liberalization programme , which culminated in full liberalization of the market in 1997 , has undoubtedly brought many benefits to consumers both in terms of access and cost . #% Perhaps we could ring the bells . #% 
We are all aware of the difficulties that the international community has had with the Iranian Government concerning its compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . #% Mr President , I noticed that Mr Kirkhope did not describe the IRA , and nor indeed did Mr Allister , as a fundamentalist Roman Catholic organisation , and they were quite right not do so . #% I would have had major problems with a salary increase or with the idea of an EU-wide tax system . #% Mr President , I should like to convey to you a message I received when I was in New York last week . #% Could the President confirm that the study which has been carried out would , even at this late stage , look at fisheries in isolation rather than look at fisheries in the global sense ? #% This is certainly a matter of common interest for Member States and it does indeed complement the workings of the internal market . #% Even though Amina Lawal would have the right to appeal her verdict before a non-religious court , she has suffered enough . #% If our Taoiseach 's strategy is to insist upon a European Council declaration that Irish military neutrality is not affected by the Treaty of Nice , then he has once again misrepresented both the Treaty of Nice and Ireland 's role in Partnership for Peace to his own people . #% As we move into the next century let it be the first century in our island history in which we will have no killing on our streets and no emigration of our young people to other lands to earn a living . #% This is our business , in the same way that what happens within the EU is Egypt 's business when it affects the agreements mentioned . #% Indeed , their vigour , their enthusiasm , and most importantly , their all-round good humour in dealing with difficult issues should be recognised . #% I believe that the delay , for which you are now being reproached in debates like this , is totally undignified and unwarranted , and that you and this Parliament find themselves becoming the victim as bystander of a process of an Executive outside this House . #% The rejection of the Verts/ALE amendment requiring that Member States reach such an agreement means that the report , which is serious and important , is fundamentally flawed . #% I congratulate Parliament 's rapporteurs on their work and indeed the quality of both these reports and all of those people who have provided very good opinions to the reports . #% I do not share the Member 's general views as expressed on Article 235 . #% Close to 400 000 babies are born prematurely annually , yet there is no funding for research in this area . #% For two years , during the development cooperation instrument process , we tried to persuade the Commission and others that we were really in the business of trying to find a really good instrument . #% We must be fully aware of the consequences of what is proposed . #% The fact that the President-in-Office is red-haired does not in any way mean we should compare him to Red Rum who was one of the best stayers on the Grand National course . #% It crosses all classes and all generations . #% Changing this to patenting is a recipe for handing the software industry over to lawyers instead of the creative people who have led the boom in technology . #% I would like to mention a number of issues here ; one relates to the European schools . #% The provisions of these conventions must be honoured and we can not arbitrarily throw them out of the window when it does not suit us . #% Attractive Employment and Working Conditions and #% It is important that the emphasis on European added value in employment policy should not become an escape clause designed to mask the unwillingness of a number of social-democrat-led governments to embrace necessary domestic economic reform . #% The vision of the founding fathers of Europe has been further realised as a direct consequence of the accession of ten new countries into the Union . #% There are a number of areas in which Parliament has clearly improved on the original proposal . #% Some progress has been made for some people with some disabilities . #% Regrettably fraud occurs by falsifying certificates of origin . #% I believe that the World Health Organisation has taken the correct approach on this issue . #% In providing and caring for the elderly , that will mean utilising new technologies and new methods of ensuring that they have independent means of living and can fully participate in their own community . #% I have seen some progress . #% It is particularly important that the more than 50 % of the world 's population which is deprived of infrastructure , electricity and energy for development should be provided with decentralized infrastructures in a proper and concrete way . #% The EU Parliament too often closes its eyes to the persecution of such Protestants within its bounds . #% It means it conforms to the Directive on electrical equipment , and that is why , today , we are putting to you three requests : to examine the concept of a supplementary marking to enhance consumer information on product safety , to carry out an in-depth study in order to clarify the feasibility , the possible benefits and the potential drawbacks for such a marking for all stakeholders , including business and consumers , and to examine the possibilities for reinforcing the credibility of the CE marking through measures for stronger customs control inside and outside the European Union , to make sure we end the consumer confusion as regards the CE marking . #% We govern , after all , by consent . #% What is interesting as well as that the chairman , Ray MacSharry is a former European Commissioner for Agriculture and he is still refusing to acknowledge the fact that Coillte is a public entity and that it is not entitled to such payments . #% Hence my amendment , for which I urge support , for a 2011 timetable deadline for Greece , Portugal and Ireland . #% When the Commissioner does that , would he also again talk to Commissioner Fischer Boel about allowing countries in Europe to have GM-free status ? #% We recognize the advantages due to the cuts in transaction costs , due to the harmonization of interest rates and the growth in employment potential of EMU ; but we also have to say that we do not believe necessarily that EMU and social cohesion are mutually reinforcing . #% Mr President , is this the European Union or do some have expansionist ambitions beyond the boundaries of Europe ? #% However , when that imposition would help to realise a core EU principle such as social inclusion , then it is indeed important . #% Many others are offered introductions with a view to marriage . #% I have closely reviewed the discussions and debates on how best to achieve this and I can support the Commission 's proposal regarding the SPC extension , in tandem with the review mechanism proposed in the Regulation . #% If we are to make any meaningful contribution to the policies proposed as priorities then we have to have at least some expansion in the amount of resources available to us . #% This initial six-month ban has been extended on a rolling basis ever since , despite a categorical Commission announcement in 2004 that there was no risk of TSE occurrence , let alone transmission , from fishmeal fed to ruminants and that the policy of zero tolerance of meat and bone spicules in animal feed should be lifted . #% I believe that great credit is due to the Commission for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each and every one of the issues surrounding the original crisis . #% Sadly , stoning seems to have been only stopped temporarily , for reasons of image . #% But they must speak with honesty , not using double-speak or with forked tongues . #% However , with a referendum taking place in Ireland next week , I felt that it would not be appropriate to participate in this vote as it is broader than the text of the Treaty itself . #% That is why we would like to see both and , in particular , impact assessments or evaluations of where we went wrong . #% Having visited Kashmir and seen some of the devastating effects of the past violence but also having seen a people ready for peace , I support this report based on the importance it has for the way the European Union seeks , by offering best practice measures and experience , to show other countries how an economic zone can develop peace and prosperity in regions that have a history of war . #% Mr Wynn says that the Council says there is no more money : absolute rubbish ! #% That is a total distortion of the truth and an abuse of the urgency procedure in this Parliament . #% I regret that . #% It would be unfortunate if , in the end , we were bounced into ill-thought-out or ill-conceived solutions without due reflection and debate because this will be crucial to our effective ability to cope with enlargement - a point , again , which the Taoiseach quite correctly emphasized as the next major challenge beyond the IGC . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner if she thinks it might be useful for us to have a cohesion audit on an annual basis and try to build that into the Commission 's work programme . #% Our immediate objective must be to restore farmer confidence in the political process and to safeguard the integrity of the common agricultural policy , outside of which EU agriculture will not survive . #% I believe that we must increase mesh size to prevent unnecessary discarding of juvenile fish . #% While I welcome and support the dialogue and the development of a positive relationship between the European Union and China , removal of the arms embargo in the immediate term is still premature . #% So we have to look at what we are doing and the interests of consumers have to come before the interests of big business and profit . #% However , I fully support the resolution , as does the PPE-DE Group , with perhaps a couple of caveats . #% The Cohesion Fund is an invaluable tool in helping less well-off Member States catch up , particularly in the development of infrastructure networks and upgrading of water supplies , in order to contribute to the long-term sustainable development of disadvantaged regions . #% We should not get ideologically fixed on the whole question of whether we have a common policy or not . #% Ireland 's home lies in Europe , both historically and politically . #% The key provisions - Art. 9 , paragraph 4 - state that a Member State `` shall not be in breach of this Directive '' if a decision not to introduce domestic water charges based on `` established practice does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the objectives of this Directive '' . #% 
I also want to speak very briefly about driftnets , for their use is dealt with under technical measures . #% Indeed , the UK vice tax has only encouraged this worrying pattern of companies establishing themselves overseas and thus avoiding the need to apply for a UK licence . #% One hand does n't seem to know what the other is doing . #% The EU can only spend a maximum of 1.2 % of the combined GDP of all its Member States . #% I wish to quote from the letter that Gillian Shephard wrote to you in which she says : ' We do not wish to go down the path suggested by the Commission . ' #% In July 2004 , the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision on the Community position , to be adopted on certain proposals submitted to the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention . #% If we are going to ask consumers to choose organic , we are going to have to ensure that what they buy is actually organic . #% Mr President , I believe that the European Parliament should give its assent to the European Energy Charter which was underwritten in The Hague in December 1991 . #% The Commission proposals were tough and will definitely have an impact upon the fishing communities involved , but they had to be tough because the state of the stocks is so poor . #% It is an extremely important issue because although it will not affect people in Ireland and the UK - because we do not eat horses - it will in other countries . #% Doha was oversold for its potential for lifting the poor out of poverty . #% I believe that the question of voting rights in this new agency should not be used as a subterfuge to allow the Commission to dominate proceedings . #% Fundamentally , I feel there is a serious conflict in the description of European citizen which is in the Maastricht Treaty if somehow we are strangers to each other and must show passports while we travel within the Union . #% One regrettable point about the treaty is that the seat of the European Parliament has now been reinforced here . #% We have seen the dramatic affect the Socrates programme has had in our own countries . #% Reproach has been made in my presence that it is not the European Parliament 's job to put forward this sort of initiative . #% If terrorists were to get hold of this material we would be facing devastation . #% Otherwise , we would be in a very serious situation , particularly if , as is proposed , the United States provides aid to their airlines . #% In the Middle East , I condemn the way in which human rights are abused because of the use of terrorism , especially suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian extremists . #% Also very startling was the amount of human death from cancer and the amount of learning disability among children . #% This attitude , I find , is appalling . #% Finally , I would urge the Belgian presidency to ensure that the difficult chapters of negotiation with the applicant countries are opened as soon as possible . #% In 2005 we saw a 4 % growth rate in overseas visitor numbers . #% So how much are airlines making on this ? #% Success will come when we realise that the UN is an ideal that needs to be fostered and that we need an efficient organisation that can serve these ideals . #% I have spoken about employment and entrepreneurship and social justice . #% What short-term targets or actions and indicators will be needed to ensure its full development ? #% This is what the Commission proposes and I fully endorse it . #% The EU Commission had originally proposed stipulating a minimum distance of 0.5 km from the site boundary to residential areas but the Council of Ministers deleted this from the text of the draft directive . #% Indeed , some Member States have done precisely the opposite of what is needed . #% That STOA study made it absolutely clear that this is something the European Union should tackle . #% At best , it could be described as a reasonable basic document with which to start the discussion , but it lacks any concrete objectives and , as I said , any ambition . #% We clearly need a far more flexible legal framework to keep abreast of technological advances in banking systems . #% This should provide , for example , for the establishment of a European coastguard service to tackle the drugs problem , which is a dreadful blight on all our communities . #% We welcome manufacturers ' development of pedestrian-friendly car fronts , automatic braking systems and the use of daylight running lights , although obviously there is controversy on that particular topic . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on the amount of work he has put into this , indeed into all issues that come before the Committee on Fisheries . #% Any further contamination , such as another Chernobyl-type of accident , will create an environmental deficit and liability for future generations that makes sustainability an impossible goal to achieve . #% It should assist in improving competitiveness through investment and in improving skills training for our workers and for the temporary unemployed . #% At present , the funding is decidedly inadequate if we are to attempt seriously to meet the commitments entered into at the Essen European Summit in 1994 . #% We support the flexibility amendments to send a message to the Commission that there is room for different treatment in some Member States in relation to this regime , providing that it does not come from the flat rate payment . #% Most European countries are bad and some are appalling . #% Its political and parliamentary leadership has shown that it is unable or unwilling to control them . #% It is not acceptable that public health be put at risk like this . #% In particular , I should like to congratulate Mrs Waddington on some of the innovative measures which she brings forward , but also on not being afraid to criticize where the Commission has fallen down on its duty and responsibility to respond to the urgent need for training in our society . #% The only criticism I have of that section of the reports is that I do not feel there is enough flexibility built in to ensure that the so-called standby or waiting period is taken into consideration . #% I congratulate Mr Watson and all concerned in putting together this report . #% Israeli and Palestinian authorities are going to have to move to renew some level of security cooperation with the aim of ending this awful present cycle of violence . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , in fact Mr Stevenson is right : eight years ago Labour MEPs were calling for an end to the cruel trade in cat and dog fur . #% As someone who has a bank account in Brussels , occasionally comes to Strasbourg , has a bank account in Ireland and travels to other countries , I have noticed in my transaction charges over the recent past huge costs per transaction , particularly here in France , as against in Belgium . #% Food is being imported from other areas like , for example tinned food , chicken and other things , for which they can not guarantee the safety and they are not happy about this . #% It is particularly important that the temporary workers ' agencies are not excluded from the scope , given the extent to which staffing and recruitment agencies are used in a modern , flexible labour market . #% In my Member State , Ireland , there is a clear ban on any form of experimentation on human embryos or cloning . #% Bearing that in mind , I would ask you , Mr Blair , to concentrate on the urban problems as opposed to dismantling the CAP , which hopefully will strengthen rural communities in the years ahead . #% We have a duty to ensure that we cooperate and coordinate with other representatives of the peoples of Europe . #% A lot of new computers have just one password to turn on the computer and do not have a separate password to control access to the Internet . #% Hospital patients and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to resistant bacteria . #% ADRs , therefore , can not be a replacement for legal remedy . #% Mr President , I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on attempting to find a compromise between the different points of view on this issue . #% By any standards these comments are excessive , unfair and , in the context of the discharge procedure , wholly unsuitable . #% This directive will go some way to linking cooperation and exchanges of information , as well as extending the scope and range of the offences . #% So we must guarantee that we can deliver real skills and real training to people to allow them to get real jobs , not simply massage the figures to take them off the unemployment statistics for a few months . #% What is the situation , because if , for example , a request for a roll call has been made , other groups do not actually make a request so the opportunity to hold a roll-call vote on the final report is denied us ? #% It is up to the Commission to come forward with a proposal that is water-tight and workable . #% Likewise , the opportunity of rural development and new technology in terms of creating farm and part-time employment for both women and men must , in every case , be vigorously pursued . #% We look forward to receiving the Commission 's analysis of the economic and political developments since the freezing of the previous application in 1996 . #% I tried to establish how other States deal with this problem and I find the only comparable systems are in the United States and the Netherlands . #% 
Parliament has now called for action , with this majority support . #% Commissioner , you will probably remember that the late Phillip Whitehead , the former chairman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection , asked you as a Commission to take action . #% in writing . - This proposal on behalf of the mobilisation of EGAF for German workers - as well as the proposal from the Lithuanian refrigeration sector - was to be among the first beneficiaries of the fund in 2010 . #% Having listened to Mr Gomolka 's contribution I am even more disturbed that we are not going to give due reflection to this dossier . #% The timing of the present communication gives it a special significance in that it represents a bridge to the Green Paper to be published on the review of the common fisheries policy . #% I have been at a meeting where they invited the scientists to come and look at the Irish Sea and the scientists would not even come and look at it . #% If not , the blood that flows will be on their hands as surely as on the hands of those who pull the triggers or plant the bombs . #% The establishment , at the beginning of the current term , of a permanent European Parliament delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament is a very positive step which will contribute to consolidate the increasingly political engagement of the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly . #% I know that this Parliament is serious about fisheries conservation . #% I do not think it makes much difference if we made it eight or ten hours , but we have to decide something . #% As far as we in Northern Ireland are concerned , we will not see any change unless we achieve a totally different approach from our planning services . #% We are talking about the present , namely the present dangers of nuclear accidents and the present uncertainty surrounding the disposal of existing radioactive waste . #% The Commission puts a lot of emphasis on ` working with the market ' . #% Madam President , life is one constant risk-benefit analysis - what we do , where we go and what we eat . #% Mr Haarder , on behalf of his colleagues in Council , did not tell us on what Council 's judgement was based . #% Mrs Oomen-Ruijten brought forward issues that relate not to abstract numbers or abstract individuals , but to real people who encounter this kind of discrimination every day . #% But the choice is clear : either you support Mr Oostlander or you send out the dangerous message that heroin and synthetic drugs for personal use and distribution are acceptable . #% Over the past number of years the European Union has been doing the right thing by trying to convince other countries to be reasonable in relation to the kind of quotas they set for themselves . #% Too often we do not get the sort of support from Member States and from national governments that is needed to convince the public that determined and substantial efforts have to be made to enforce all the laws and regulations . #% In this regard I have proposed tomorrow two amendments to item 2 and item 3 , adding a word : `` to ensure that EU-funded programmes do not cause ` unauthorised ' damage or destruction to actual or potential protected sites '' . #% in writing . - Paragraph 68 of this report contains a reference to a common consolidated corporate tax base , stating that there should be a common basis for company taxation . #% Yes , people blame the Sudanese Government , and it is to blame . #% Because of reform of the EU financial systems and reductions in structural funding and cohesion funding to certain countries under the Agenda 2000 reform package , it is essential that we find new ways of financing these very essential projects . #% I recognise that this was a difficult compromise which does address the problem - the potentially disastrous consequences of absolute freedom of movement - while at the same time recognising the need to respect the new law . #% Let us hope that this will be at the Berlin summit in March . #% I appreciate that there has been rescheduling of debt but multilateral lenders do not reschedule and that is reflected in the fact that African countries owe the International Development Agency $ 25 billion compared with $ 2.58 billion in 1980 . #% We must commit to giving our utmost support , financial and otherwise , to achieve this . #% The wording I have used is taken from Parliament 's own resolution of September 2000 on human cloning , where we called for a universal ban . #% We should do it now while we have the time and the calm to do it and , as I say , guarantee the services we need in Europe . #% The European Union needs to support and encourage global governance reform , particularly as regards the Security Council , whose make up does not reflect the realities of the 21st century . #% They are in my prayers . #% It is in all our interests to encourage these countries to reach their maximum potential as soon as possible . #% However , I do not believe it is to the best advantage of the European peoples . #% They have largely been treated - I regret to say - with indifference and indeed , very often with contempt . #% I also strongly support information actions on the common agricultural policy . #% No-one has yet mentioned that people create jobs . #% I would just like to point out that Mr Titley himself has a lot of questions to answer . #% I deplore and regret the Commission 's breach of good faith . #% Also , with new designs of landfill sites , certain of the dangers have been eliminated . #% We had a worse situation in the past , when mismanagement of large companies resulted in the fact that , in the clearance of accounts procedures , major corrections were being made against the Member States which were not passed on to the food processors and the people who were involved in the abuses in the first place . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report . #% After that , God only knows . #% These proposals relate to natural disasters , such as fires , droughts and floods . #% However , we should act quickly on this through the EU . #% Mr President , approximately 58 000 people die each year in the European Union as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury . #% These plasma products , particularly in the UK and Ireland , are largely imported from the US from paid donors . #% The entirely innocent people who were accidentally present at the time of the murder have been obliged to remain silent about these events : in effect to become accomplices in the crime of these thugs and criminals . #% One of the important issues raised within the discussions at conciliation and also within the report itself is in clearing up some of the wording used . #% Since March this year , opponents of President Obiang 's regime have been arbitrarily detained and tried under deplorable and unacceptable conditions . #% I would particularly like to mention the category issue here which I suppose effectively means getting back to the first reading position on this . #% As regards the issue of waste water from slaughter houses , I believe that this must be reviewed as it covers a huge quantity of material for disposal . #% It is only now that we are beginning to take action on it . #% Nevertheless I believe in free trade . #% I voted `` against '' . #% These are the children who 20 years from now will be the leaders , or perhaps the victims , or the suicide bombers . #% The system is certainly very necessary , if nothing else than to achieve a level playing field within the European Union and to ensure that all countries reach the same standards . #% In the long term , we must consider the welfare of the animals and create incentives to reduce the need for long-distance transport . #% In Britain and in Ireland we have a different legal system - the old common law system - to that which pertains in the majority of other Member States . #% We should be talking about sectoral targets for CO2 emissions and here transport is one of the biggest sinners . #% They want help with new technology . #% The Fed formula devised by the US Federal Reserve , according to one of its former economists , shows that typically , when house prices have been driven up for several years by low interest rates , when interest rates increase , prices begin to decline roughly 18 months to 2 years later . #% We do so because we fail at national level to integrate the various economic , social , cultural and environmental policies that we pursue . #% I hope that the US President will come up with a firm proposal to outline how his administration intends to reduce the level of greenhouse gases in the immediate future . #% I do not have a legal definition of all arrangements with the Union . #% This depleted uranium has been used in Cumbria up to 1995 , and it is believed that as many as 1400 depleted uranium shells have been fired into the Solway Firth , which is an inlet of the Irish Sea . #% Some measures might turn out to be superficial ; others might need to be more efficient . #% 
On a very excluding special needs education system ? #% We need to help to ensure that these cultural and artistic trades are encouraged and made available to a wider audience . #% Today is a watershed in the reform of the European Commission . #% The truth is that serious concern exists on a number of levels . #% This might not look like a problem , but I am told that it is the most serious way of exporting Asian bird flu to Europe . #% Verification of such claims is also crucial if consumers are actually to have confidence in this . #% We need to talk about the quality and affordability of those services . #% I have practised in family law myself for a number of years and I have seen the difficulties and delays suffered by couples of mixed marriages involved in child-abduction cases . #% The farmers themselves are in a very , very critical situation , where they are extremely short of food and the excess taxes on them makes the situation even more catastrophic . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , first of all , I want to thank the rapporteur for her good work ; she certainly made my life easier . #% Mr President , the Commission 's proposals for the WTO negotiation modality , or rules on agriculture , were unanimously supported by Member States at the recent General Affairs Council , following earlier discussions with various trade policy groups and the agriculture fora . #% In 2001 , Equitable Life lost a case in the UK that made it impose exit penalties on UK policyholders , though money for Irish policyholders was supposed to be ring-fenced and safe . #% I would like to urge the presidency , particularly the incoming French Minister , to make this dossier a priority to help to resolve the crisis in availability , especially for what we call minor uses and so-called minor species , which include sheep , horses , bees , fish and many other animals that are not so minor in many of our countries . #% It achieved a lot in terms of finalising the overall financial parameters for spending within the EU for the seven-year period after 1999 . #% I hope those Member States that abstained and displayed such openness will be persuaded to vote for the resolution when it comes before the General Assembly for a final vote next month . #% Along with your welcome to the new Northern Ireland Assembly Members , I wanted you to welcome them also . #% It is a Treaty language and it should have that status . #% I thank the Swedish minister here this morning for her confirmation that there is going to be a convention . #% Ring vaccination has to be the way in which we look at trying to control it . #% I myself was absent , but I have had this confirmed to me . #% It does not help that a leading Eurosceptic has been promoted to full cabinet rank . #% On the Irish radio programme ` Live Line ' he disingenuously claimed , that as these votes closed at 5.14 pm , I could have easily caught the Frankfurt to Dublin flight . #% Yet I am always concerned that having more documents does not lead to transparency . #% I recently visited a number of orchard owners in Northern Ireland who have suffered from the declining bee population and indeed voiced their concern over it . #% The scrapping of the Supreme Court did immeasurable damage to the separation of power systems within Pakistan . #% In a resolution on the renewed Social Agenda approved by the last European Parliament in May of this year , again we state that we consider that strengthening of the implementation and enforcement of existing labour law under national and community law and under ILO conventions must be a priority for EU institutions and Member States . #% We regret that the Commission is unable to recommend the amendments to the regulation which my group are putting forward . #% As we work through the process of formulating a European mental health strategy , the most important question we should ask ourselves is : will this make someone 's life better ? #% We must make sure that our response is common and not isolated , shared and not unilateral , aimed at our common enemy , which is terrorism , but not at wider forces such as Islam or the wider Arab world , should that be the source whence this monster may have sprung . #% You may laugh , Mr President , but I am serious . #% Our government has reapplied , and I am hoping that that will change , because , if it does not , it ensures that the government can not apply really active measures from a state point of view to bring in larger companies . #% Our warmest congratulations to you . #% Mr President , I wish to take this opportunity , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party , to congratulate the various rapporteurs . #% The vast majority of people even in the border area of Southern Ireland have no aspiration to intimidate the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland into a United Ireland . #% Mr President , on Mrs Lynne 's report , the European Union can present a great model to the rest of the world , in particular with regard to how best we treat those who are most vulnerable within our society . #% This will remain so whether public service providers are in the public or private sector . #% The 1999-2000 household budget survey shows that almost 60 % of farm household income now comes from non-farm sources , contributing to the future viability of many farms . #% Breaking off the negotiations did not have the same negative impact as it had at the end of 1996 when all fisheries were suspended . #% Mr President , on a point of information for Members who may not be aware of this : Commissioner Bangemann was wrong in what he has proposed , especially when he held up the examples of the Scandinavian countries in the deregulation of postal services . #% Unless we address the very serious problem of the declining age profile in European agriculture , in the not too distant future Parliament will be sitting in an emergency session to address what has turned out to be a very serious problem . #% However , we can go further . #% It is a sad fact that in my own country -- and I believe in other European countries -- the threat of genital mutilation or stoning or honour murders are not a basis for granting refugee status . #% In order to take advantage of this positive relationship , the institutions of the EU must ensure an agreement that is modern while being full and fair for all . #% Personally , I am against a federal Europe . #% The directive must make it mandatory for landfill sites to be located beyond a certain distance from residential areas . #% Nevertheless , the amount of money which we spend has a minimal impact on monetary or economic policy within this Community , while national governments are not cutting back spending . #% Madam President , I echo the remarks of the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , Mr von Wogau , with regard to the procedure in this matter . #% The German Government has already stated that it is ready to restart the shipments of spent nuclear fuel to Cumbria , and the Dutch Government has overseen the transportation of two shipments of nuclear spent material to Sellafield in recent times . #% We should all be aware that this report came about , to a large extent , as a result of the aeroplanes flying into the Twin Towers in New York in September 2001 . #% The Spanish authorities should therefore learn from the experience in Northern Ireland . #% For all of these reasons , and more importantly because these proposals would mean a 40 % reduction in the Irish white fish fleet and a loss of approximately 2000 jobs , I will be supporting the Varela report . #% I am pleased that the German presidency has also made a priority of support for Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , as you can hear , we have a huge clash here between ethical and moral considerations of many religions and cultures and the ambitions of the pharmaceutical industries to secure their position in global markets . #% However , we still have enormous developmental and structural needs . #% The potential is clear : if the European Union , today , in its Member States , were to attain the best practice already achieved by its existing states and by its competitors we would have 30 million more jobs , twice as many as are currently unemployed . #% Who does this informing apart from France and the UK ? #% Nobody lives there . #% Unfortunately Europe 's contribution is often unremarked in these situations , and we have to have a visible presence on the ground and show our solidarity , not just in the military campaign but also in the humanitarian effort . #% So how does the Commissioner reconcile that with just getting rid of all these jobs in one fell swoop ? #% People in the Member States have to know the decisions that have been taken on their behalf which may not , in the long-term , be in their interests . #% What is happening to him and has that case been raised by the Council ? #% While I have registered serious concerns about what I viewed as the reported lack of tolerance expressed by my former colleague Mr Buttiglione -- a PPE-DE colleague for the last five years -- in his statements on certain issues such as Baltic minorities , homosexuality and sinning , single mothers and fathers , I agree to support his candidature on balance . #% I deplore that innocent civilians are used as human shields . #% When the time came , would these same people support those amendments in another situation ? #% It is time we got our act together and resolved these decision-making problems . #% I also welcome the focus on the sharing of best practices and the rights of sufferers and their families . #% 
In particular , the possibility of using 20 % modulation in the CAP to fund rural development without having to meet the agreed rules on co-financing and spending guidelines is regrettable and could lead to a distortion of competition between Member States . #% Nowadays those young people have many other options open to them . #% Madam President , I wish to point out that when we vote on the structural fund aspects of the greening block , in fact , our amendments and the comments on this line contravene the structural fund regulations . #% As regards utification , I take note of the Commission 's caution in relation to an agriculture directive concerning water pollution . #% This matter is not going to go away . #% This would serve a very positive function for all farmers in receipt of CAP payments in future . #% It is an appalling situation and I would appeal to you to write to all the parties concerned . #% As was pointed out previously , the EU makes a major contribution together with the United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . #% Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years . #% How will the 2 billion in aid be distributed ? #% The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on . #% The rapporteur was correct to point out that in view of the Kyoto timetable , we must be careful not to invalidate the directive by a long transition period , particularly for certification in specific areas . #% Last year , amidst the final crescendo , publications such as were reporting that UNICEF 's failure to develop a coherent strategy for child survival and its shortcomings were contributing to 10 million child deaths per year . #% This has all taken place in secret , behind closed doors . #% A personal and vitriolic attack like that is unjustified when the person is not present . #% I agree with several things in the report . #% Mr President , I am speaking on the broad economic guidelines . #% I know there is debate in the scientific community as to whether the models used by the IPCC stand up , and that debate will continue , but the majority of people accept the IPCC modelling and the projections arising from it . #% In the era of doing less and doing it better we need instruments to help us to be better at doing our work . #% I therefore welcome the announcement today by the Commissioner that implants have been reclassified as medical devices , and the effects that will have on how they may be controlled . #% I do not wish to repeat what has been said by colleagues who have already spoken but it has been a very great two-and-a-half years . #% I answered : number one is waste , number two is waste , number three is waste , number four is waste and number five is waste . #% I want to make it quite clear that the position of the Liberal Group is that we shall vote for the joint resolution and we shall not vote for any amendments . #% I would prefer this Parliament 's decision to prevail and I can not put my name to a regulation that is not legally sound and will not withstand legal scrutiny . #% The ECJ , after years of deliberation , becomes the arbiter of better legislation . #% This is a fallacy . #% Hundreds of Palestinians have been left homeless as a result of the demolition of nearly 100 houses by the Israeli forces at the refugee camp in the Gaza Strip . #% We hope that the EU draws a lesson from this whole experience . #% We in this House watched murder and rape in Bosnia . #% The purpose of my putting this question was to shift the emphasis , because poverty can not be tackled through a continuation of the same old formula . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mrs Theato on her report . #% I particularly welcome the proposal for a statutory right to interest on late payments . #% I was putting the whole thing in context . #% The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict . #% The European Council has since launched two action plans to combat organised crime , aimed at overcoming disparities in national procedures and encouraging more efficient judicial cooperation . #% However it is very important that any codes of practice which are drawn up by EU airlines are fully evaluated and monitored to ensure that they are rigorously enforced . #% Could the Defence Minister of the incoming Presidency come to this House at an early date and make a statement to us ? #% Whether it is his bulk carrier or the speedboat version that is commended by Mr Elles , I certainly think that the Commissioner 's focus on deepening the relationship and on being more strategic - even if there is argument on detail - is , in broad terms very welcome . #% Madam President , when I heard that poor Mr Blak was in trouble again I naturally rushed to see what could be done about it as quickly as possible . #% It is now evident that the European Union has come to assume a pivotal role in pursuing peace within the Middle East . #% Has no one in the Council been reading the paper for the last 25 years ? #% The EU leaders reaffirmed the inclusive nature of the accession process which now comprises 13 candidate States within a single framework . #% Rural areas are different from urban areas , but the policy priorities for rural regions have to fit in with the overall objectives , as you have set out , of competitiveness and economic growth , environmental sustainability and quality-of-life issues . #% Unless conservation is the number one priority , compromises with other objectives of the common fisheries policy , such as economic ones , will always lead to further erosion of stocks . #% In fact , if you look around the European Union and look at the countries which have done well over the years , the ones which have created a lot of jobs and given their people higher standards of living , they are all the countries which have pursued sound money policies . #% I have to say to the Commissioner : you have enough tools in the box at the moment with cross-compliance ; we do not need more . #% We must also ensure that in the European Union human dignity is protected and the weakest and most vulnerable are defended . #% I used my vote to endorse Amendments 354 and 352 as a means of opposing funding of research activities aimed at the cloning of human embryos . #% I hope , Mr Solana , that you will use your role to give an added sense of political urgency to the task of enlargement , rather than to promote procrastination . #% in writing . - The approval of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent , Deter and Eliminate Illegal , Unreported and Unregulated Fishing ( the Agreement ) is to be welcomed . #% Mr President , I support the resolution before us today . #% Of course , people can be up against big companies with huge amounts of power and resources at their disposal which makes it very very difficult in many cases for them to pursue these cases to the end and ensure that the companies pay the price . #% One ironic aspect of this report is that they are trying to push for alternative types of tobacco . #% Many commentators suggest that it is part of the strategy to ensure access to oil from the Caspian Sea . #% I would ask you , Madam President , to take the initiative and request the Commissioner to come to Parliament this week to make an up-to-date statement on this crisis . #% It is important that the information campaigns , which are to be intensified later this summer , are successfully managed . #% It seems like farmers are the first victims of trade deals but the first to be blamed when trade deals do not work . #% Overall , the protocol offers allocated fishing rights for various species , or category of vessel , to Spain , Italy , Portugal and France . #% I am therefore delighted that the European Parliament rejected this aspect of Brussels ' latest crazed proposal . #% Of course , we need new products and we need new processes and we need new ideas about how our society should be run . #% Since that is not going to be a reality and already is not a reality , we have to give some thought to how we treat those minority languages which are not used in the everyday business of the Union . #% It calls for the right of residence in Europe of those subject to the travel ban to be rescinded , for members of their families to be barred from employment and educational institutions in the European Union , for high-profile economic links with Zimbabwe that have given the regime international prestige to be curtailed , for those providing financial backing to the ZANU-PF regime to be identified , and for measures to be imposed against them . #% It is clear that there are serious distortions in the energy market with many hidden subsidies to both coal and oil generated energy . #% Without prejudice to the arrangements in existing Member States , it is a question that we must look at in due course . #% We are asking for your assistance to ensure that this vital element , as the Treaty states , in the democratic life and political debate of the Union is validated by statute . #% However we reassert , as we have done consistently , that an effective college requires the assumption of individual political responsibility . #% 
This is in line with the Council position . #% In particular , I believe that safety has to override all other considerations . #% The committee of which I am a member and which prepared this report , the Committee on Petitions , equally , is a direct link with the citizen , but has a different role in that it enables citizens to ensure that authorities in the Member State comply with European rules , regulations , funding etc. . #% In Ireland , since May of this year , the extra cost of delayed authorisations has been EUR 23 million . #% It should have requested at the very least that the UK dissociate itself from the management of the Echelon system and it should also have asked Germany to close down the interception base which is located on its territory . #% Why is it that it recommends these results should be improved on ? #% Mr Parish has made the point that consumers place great faith in the word ` organic ' and in organic produce , and we need to ensure that those who want to buy organic are actually getting what they believe is a very pure product . #% Secondly , it shows that , no matter how good your training or education or skills may be , there are people who will be caught in unemployment , and they must be guaranteed a safety net and security to allow them to have a proper and decent standard of living . #% The greatest responsibility we have as a European Union - and this was mentioned by the leader of my party , Mr Bruton , when he addressed this Parliament as President-in-Office - is to extend our good fortune to less fortunate peoples throughout the world . #% However , the Iranian Government has signed protocols to this treaty , measures which we welcome . #% We must be able to respond to that challenge . #% I would sincerely like to thank our Commissioner , Mrs Cresson , for her attention , which will be appreciated by many people in this Parliament . #% An EU directive , by setting limits to patentability in this area , could stop the drift in Europe towards a US-liberal style of patenting software as such , and indeed of patenting pure business methods . #% In this report , which particularly focuses on injury data collection , I have recommended that to promote safety and prevent injury we need better-quality data . #% Some may even have had FIFG money to transfer to those countries and I am pleased to see that the Commission has now proposed regulations to prevent public funding being used to transfer to flags-of-convenience countries . #% Brenda Wilson is a Greater Manchester constituent of mine who is an active campaigner for the Aviation Health Institute , an organisation working internationally to improve air passenger health . #% It would certainly be a serious mistake to allow the current crisis to panic us into introducing drastic budget changes which would militate against the sustainability of European family farming . #% The European Union has to address this and the dangers this will involve . #% Finally , I agree with you that they must commit to implementing policies consistent with ILO fundamental principles and rights and they must not allow the current economic crisis to be used as an excuse to weaken or disregard internationally recognised labour standards . #% I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions . #% I have some sympathy with the last speaker : sometimes the Committee on Budgetary Control gets so involved with the important work they are doing , that they are unable to see the wood for the trees . #% The convention should not be seen as giving a green light to the nuclear industry for such trafficking of deadly material . #% I would urge them to read this report ; to analyse in detail the Commission scoreboard , and when they clearly see that the single market is still a very long way from being completed , especially in the field of tax harmonisation , they might change their minds , especially in the wake of the decision at the Vienna Summit to carry out an impact study into the effects of abolition . #% Firstly , I am disappointed that the minimum allocation for the Leader axis in the budget will be reduced to 5 % . #% You can only try to develop the best possible system of traceability . #% Furthermore , the European Parliament must play an active role and strongly influence the revision of the rules already in the process of negotiations in the Basel Committee . #% Europe has done that for us and it is a big effort . #% This is currently something that we should be concerned about . #% I do welcome this report . #% Ultimately , both the environment and vehicle operators stand to gain from this proposal if carbon monoxide can be measured and then cut back and if vehicle performance can be improved . #% It is not a perfect solution , it may not be totally achievable . #% While I appreciate that Britain will not be one of these countries , it is nonetheless important that all countries , even those not participating in the single currency from day one , should be actively involved in the preparatory and planning phases for the launch of the euro because of the potential impact of this currency on all our economies , whether inside or outside the single currency zone . #% In order to place temporary pilots and aircraft engineers with an airline in Italy , a EUR 400 000 deposit and the establishment of four offices are required . #% Post-crisis , there needs to be an incentive for intellectuals and artists to use their creativity and publish new material , without fear , online . #% We have had the Amsterdam Treaty which talks about creating an area of freedom , security and justice . #% Today 's vote means that we can now sign up to the WIPO Treaty and we can give international copyright protection to our creative industries . #% Why should such a product be taken out of the seas and then given away ? #% Yesterday , a new national government for recovery was voted into power in Ireland . #% It is a matter for the Cypriot people and the Turkish people to find a solution themselves . #% While there are risks and benefits , I feel very strongly that partial decoupling proposals pose a far greater risk with no prospect of decrease in regulation . #% The report was amended earlier in committee and several difficulties which arose at that stage of the procedure were overcome . #% Maybe there is a difference in language and interpretation and that what the President of the Commission meant to say was consolidation , or codification , which happens in every single government . #% Herring is being sold at 20 % lower prices than last year . #% We have done too little to alleviate the pain and distress of these children and their families . #% We must err on the side of precaution , not on the side of cost . #% Countries such as Ireland are to be badly affected by the reform of the sugar sector . #% We expect to be offering to the developing world a bigger and an earlier reduction in all agricultural tariffs and in getting rid of restrictions of imports from the developing world . #% The audiovisual industry is one of the most rapidly growing sectors in Europe . #% However , I and the rapporteur will need to go to other institutions , and we have to go fortified by the weight of this House . #% In that regard I would ask the Commissioner to examine seriously whether or not Sellafield-THORP would come into that particular category . #% We can all be proud of these achievements because we all played a key role in making them a reality . #% This repression is being stepped up because the regime fears the spread of revolution from the Middle East and North Africa . #% But it is very difficult for Members to sit right through every single question during Question Time just in case we jump from No 1 to No 99 in a matter of seconds . #% Not every Member State takes the same view . #% Even at this late stage it is better we know the problems than adopt a head-in-the-sand approach . #% While the EU is committed to closely monitoring and regulating the industry , there is , in my view , a moral responsibility on those involved to agree on standards which it is not acceptable to exceed . #% Sugar beet growing and sugar processing have a long tradition in my country , dating back almost 80 years . #% The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is now warning that some 13 million people are threatened with starvation over the next six months as a result of food shortages brought about by adverse weather conditions and flawed government planning . #% However , the use of our intelligence is also necessary to undermine the sense of alienation and injustice felt by many of those who are recruited to commit these kinds of awful acts . #% Multinational firms will only change their behaviour when they are forced to pay heavily for their misdeeds . #% Recently , a disproportionate number of those fatalities on Irish roads have , sadly , been Eastern European citizens who are working in Ireland . #% Secondly , Amendment No 11 which was orally amended , was in contravention of the right of the presumption of innocence to all . #% We need to replace it with a system of human solidarity , based on the values of democratic socialism . #% There has been some dispute , as this is an issue dealing with counter-terrorism and serious crime , over the fact that it should be done under a framework decision and not a directive . #% Clarity on the coordination of the European Commission 's policy on State aid and social policy is urgently needed . #% The consumers are bearing the brunt of that particular worry . #% 
To maintain a disease-free status a country has to be free of FMD for at least 12 months , an effective system of surveillance must be in place and all regulatory measures for the prevention and control of FMD must have been implemented . #% I would like to speak on this particular subject but from a regional aspect . #% The Commission should adopt a communication on children ' s rights to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention and create a children ' s policy unit . #% That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government . #% The Irish presidency should concentrate its efforts on implementing the roadmap and ensuring that its partners in the quartet are committed to this goal . #% We must have the courage of our convictions to defend those differences . #% In order to do this , we must grasp the difficult nettle of forging a way forward in the Israel-Palestinian problem . #% And the Power of One is perhaps something we have not promoted enough . #% Ireland is not even a full member of WEU , so why does it need to cooperate more with the WEU presidency and on what issues will it be cooperating ? #% A balance must be struck between EU textile protectionism , which costs an extra EUR 270 per year for each four-person household , and complete market distortion . #% Mr President , I should like to draw the House 's attention to the fact that this morning in Belfast the Northern Ireland Assembly came together , almost three-and-a-half years since it was elected . #% The work of the EU Ombudsman brings into focus the wider debate on accountability -- or , more accurately , the lack of accountability -- within the European Union . #% Please do not underestimate the potential of the Joint Research Centre , which is itself a scientific centre for policy - a reference centre for policy - and is ideally suited to the role of networking the centres of excellence . #% Last summer , in the United Kingdom at least , we saw the corrosive effect of cheap South American beef imports on our indigenous beef industry with plummeting prices threatening the survival of many producers . #% Compared to the US and Japan , we are woefully lacking in a proper research strategy in almost all Member States except Finland , Sweden and the Republic of Ireland - countries shown in the Commission paper to have had unusual success . #% We have had oceans since time immemorial , and this has nothing to do with our present problems with climate change , so I agree with my other colleagues and can not see what possible relevance that paragraph has . #% It is not worthy of being brought into this report either . #% Of course , we need infrastructure in science facilities and communications . #% Given this situation , would the Commissioner now ensure that some ground rules are laid down concerning the manufacture and sale of such toys ? #% We based our decision on political ideology rather than scientific investigation . #% Madam President , I should like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mrs Lambert on her tremendous work on what was a very difficult brief . #% We must also support the SDLP campaign for a PEACE 111 programme by earmarking $ 200 million in the 2007-2013 budget . #% Mr President , Commissioner , this proposal for a Council regulation concerns the prolongation of the fisheries protocol which has been in force between the EU and Senegal for the period of 1 May 1997 to 30 April 2001 . #% The very existence of the Ombudsman 's office , I believe , is a deterrent to maladministration , and the 10th anniversary of that office deserves a review of the statute . #% Mr President , it is not actually on my own question but on behalf of Mr Gallagher , whose question is No 10 . #% Let me make an altogether separate point of order . #% From the outset , had I been allowed to draft this report in the Irish language , the problem would not have arisen because I would have used the word , which , unlike the English word ` fisherman ' , is gender-neutral and embraces all those involved in the sector . #% Most fundamentally , there is no coordination and no unit of the Commission , no Directorate-General which takes a lead in developing a coherent , overall policy on children . #% We also need to recognise that sovereign states have their role to play in that they control their national police forces and security services . #% You will not force Member States and companies into complying with the law if there are no adequate sanctions in place . #% Thousands , even millions of adults will face adulthood with cardiovascular disease from a paediatric medicine tested for its effect on behaviour , not hearts . #% Therefore , I feel we can not vote on it . #% There are large variations , depending on the size of the farm and the system of farming . #% I really do not see the difference , and I urge you to reconsider what you have said this evening to come to our committee , look at this one case as an example of what we need for the public of Europe and for the workers in our nuclear plants . #% The French government should follow the example of the British government . #% Mr President , I believe it is important that we all use this opportunity to highlight the unfortunate rise in racism at football matches in Europe . #% As has been stated and restated time and time again , forums such as the NSRAC were established in order to canvass and to utilise the wide body of expertise and opinion among people on the ground , people on the coalface , people who know the industry and to counteract the perception that Brussels or Strasbourg make policies which are often seen as ` about you , without you ' . #% We need to make European businesses more competitive ; more support mechanisms must be put in place to assist small - and medium-sized enterprises . #% I share that belief strongly which is why on this occasion I feel at ease in supporting this report and do so in good conscience . #% That is what the framework programme is for . #% For its part , the European Parliament will no longer be prepared to be presumed to be the junior partner in European decision-making . #% I hope that we will be able to welcome you back in the near future , when you will be able to see and perhaps help us on our way through some of those difficulties . #% However , I must point out that there are some elements of this report which I do not support . #% It may well indeed be possible that ten states could be ready by that time and if that is the case , that would be very welcome . #% The European Consensus on humanitarian aid , signed on 18 December 2007 , underscores the will of the EU to cooperate closely in this field in order to be as effective as possible , to defend and promote the basic humanitarian principles of humanity , neutrality , impartiality and independence , and actively to advocate the observance of international humanitarian law . #% Madam President , first of all I would like to express my grave disappointment at the resolution which we have before us . #% The export to regimes with poor human rights records would be allowed if the weapons were to be used to protect the police . #% However , to target the creation of jobs for others , particularly in a region like Dundalk , which needs economic stability to copperfasten the process of peace and reconciliation , is unacceptable . #% I greatly welcome that , but one has to recognise that , without real governmental commitment , the full potential can never be achieved . #% Finally I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute and thank the secretariat of the Fisheries Committee for their assistance and also the secretariat in my own group . #% However we must also take action to ensure that there are fewer victims in the future . #% The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real . #% Mr President , it is good that we have so many environmental reports here today . #% We can have more influence over them through the present vehicle than we could have otherwise . #% Our position is plain and simple and fully in line with the mandate of the Conference of Presidents . #% Top priority continues to be the need to protect and to care for the refugees . #% Some people have decided to create the impression that this is an issue pitching the large multinationals against small SMEs . #% Mr President , I should like to add my thanks for the Commissioner 's excellent work over the past five years and to wish him well in his future career . #% That risk , which I hope has disappeared , can not be taken again even if it means postponing enlargement . #% I know it is an important issue for President Barroso and for others to try to move away from unanimity where it is not possible to get it , but if you do that you further alienate not only governments , but the people as well : people who see Europe as an autocratic body trying to force its own will on others . #% It is not helpful in terms of prevention to know the overall number of road fatalities . #% Therefore there are limited indigenous outlets to use recycling packaging in the manufacture of new packaging . #% These unilateral quotas contributed to the obliteration of some of the stocks in eastern Canada ; I say ` contributed to ' for the responsibility does not actually lie with the EU alone . #% What we have seen in Palestine over the last 30 years has been a failure to meet any one of those four criteria . #% Consumer confidence in banks is of paramount importance . #% I hope that the Irish referendum will not get in the way of this process . #% 
In view of our history , I am perhaps a little more liberal in my thinking about these particular issues . #% While I agree with much of this report , I am wary of proposals for a corporate consolidated tax base and voted against accordingly . #% Therefore , anyone who advocates the isolation of China as a foreign policy strategy , for whatever reason , is being unrealistic . #% Nevertheless , there must be infinite compassion for those who have been stricken . #% I think this is the start of that process . #% in writing . - Having worked on this area at Committee level before , I am obliged to stress the point that impact assessments must be free from outside interference and that this independence must be protected at all levels . #% The basis for the European convergence model must be the successful tax regimes rather than the ones that are creating difficulties . #% The IAEA at their conference in Vienna last week still deny these findings , although the Ukrainian , Russian and Belarussian delegations dispute their figures . #% But as well as betraying the EU/EOM and ordinary Pakistanis , you are also betraying the ideals of your own Presidency . #% We need rigorous and exhaustive impact studies before any such scheme takes place . #% We all need chemicals as part of everyday life , but we also need to guarantee their safety . #% Remember that it is the farmers who , through a whopping 9.5 % modulation from the single farm payment in 2006 , are going to be key funders . #% As you will know , in a rather complex procedure , Parliament has already been consulted on the agreement itself . #% I am sure that people in this House have firm opinions on this matter . #% That is why we have asked for national plans with clear targets that will guarantee the return of the investment . #% It will eliminate the current opt-out , and introduce strict new conditions on how ` on call ' time can be counted towards the 48-hour week . #% Some people speak of the pensions time bomb and , given some of the figures that I have seen estimating the gap between what we currently put aside for both public and private pension provision and the resources we will need to ensure adequate pension provision for the next forty years , that gap is huge . #% I consider that Parliament must continue to press for ratification by the Yemen of important international human rights conventions and continue to take up individual cases of human rights abuses as they are presented to us . #% At the same time , cuts must not have a negative impact on the quality of Parliament 's legislative work . #% Those which delayed were wrong , especially those which at the same time took advantage of the opening of markets elsewhere and we have evidence that this also applies to countries outside the European Union . #% So we need longer-term and future planning as well as the immediate aid requirements . #% I understand there is plenty of information that some supermarket chains in the UK have publicly declared that they have excluded Irish beef from their shelves for the moment . #% We should also look at questions like the disability sector , the education sector and the importance of life-long learning and education and training with regard to employment and other social exclusion problems which we discussed this morning , when we were speaking about the Van Velzen report and the Commission 's response . #% However , it does not address the unemployment question or the downside , negative aspects of the abolition of duty-free in terms of airports , airlines and , indeed , shipping companies that are already under severe pressure . #% There are a broad range of projects which we can support , involving the promotion and protection of human rights and support for democracy and good governance in developing countries . #% Think of the purchasing power which those billions could release to our economy . #% Given the ongoing difficulties in the agricultural sector , more resources are required . #% I wish to congratulate the rapporteur in her absence on an excellent report , which , I believe , is a very significant contribution to the debate . #% Please , in all of this , do not ask the poorest people in the world to carry a burden they are not able to carry . #% There is a two-year waiting list and something like double the number of clinics are required in order to cope with the numbers involved . #% There is also a belief that the objective of a common policy on immigration should be enshrined in the proposed new treaty . #% This becomes ever more worrying when we see that while the UN-nominated judges will be screened by the Cambodian Supreme Council of the Magistrate , a body controlled by the ruling party of Phnom Penh , the UN has no power whatsoever to screen the judges appointed by Cambodia . #% The regulation of 13 March 1998 is due to come into effect on 1 January next year . #% Mr President , the introduction of a single currency in Europe was never going to be a simple task , but with 11 countries within the Union covering a population of 300 million , I fully support the single currency . #% in writing . - I support this report , which asserts that the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement must be consistent with the actual global crisis and be carried out in a way that fully respects a partnership of equals . #% Mr President , I very much welcome the President-in-Office of the Council and Ireland 's Foreign Minister to the European Parliament this morning and I thank him very much indeed for his report on the recent summit held in Dublin . #% Nevertheless , we do have a fall in incomes . #% Better maternity leave is an investment in the future good health of our society . #% For many valid reasons , we have had to emphasise the cause of women . #% Can I say , Commissioner , that certainly the very rosy view that has been written for you by the textile unit in DGIII is not my personal experience of the textile sectors within my region and I am sure Mr Caudron will also have a different view from the French region that he represents . #% Likewise , is the presidency prepared to promote this priority in the Council . #% I believe I said some years ago that compared to national parliaments we were like children playing shop . #% The Commission can not continue to ignore what citizens are saying . #% As regards GMOs and plant genetics , the proposals that were adopted in committee would put genetically-modified foods on our table and will be forced on European consumers , quite contrary to what many want . #% It is very important that passengers are fully informed as to what they should do to guarantee that deep-vein thrombosis will not develop . #% We must work for a more sustainable industry in the future . #% We are not the body which will carry out any sort of trial on that man . #% What is wrong with having a system whereby you have to account for what you spend ? #% Madam President , the presentation by the Council of a first EU annual report on human rights was a welcome contribution to the on-going debate . #% This is the message that came out clearly from Parliament . #% Madam President , I very much agree with what Mrs Ferreira has just said . #% I believe that when you remove the farmer and his family from rural society , it begins to disintegrate . #% Pan-European infrastructures are essential to an integrated financial market , with market participants , regulators and competition authorities all playing a role . #% It is deeply regrettable that the Commission has still not come forward with the promised initiatives highlighted again and again by the European Parliament : the collective rights of employees , social security for atypical workers , protection against individual dismissal , revision of the working time directive and of the European Works Council directive . #% Such a development would have serious consequences for the socioeconomic infrastructure of rural communities . #% Why is it that those of us with questions one , two and three in part three will not receive oral answers ? #% I wish that all blood and blood products came from voluntary , unpaid sources . #% Mr President , we have been sleepwalking for decades . #% Effective mitigation requires a rapid response . #% We have aimed at the target of improved energy efficiency in buildings for some years , in the climate change programme amongst others . #% It effectively exempts Dell from facing the social consequences of its strategy and allows companies to engage in a race to the bottom supported by both Member State and EU funds . #% Certain clear targets have already been set by the Union in the energy field to reduce CO2 emissions by 8 % by the middle of the next decade and of course to double the contribution of renewable energy sources from the current 6 % to 12 % by 2010 . #% We should recall that , from an Irish perspective alone , over 6500 Irish citizens lost their pension investments either in total or in part as a result of the collapse of Equitable Life Assurance Society . #% Finally , at this important juncture , it is vital that all peoples across Europe come together and unite , and understand that , no matter what may divide us in our different ideologies , or in our different political opinions , or , indeed , in our different religions , the things that bring us together , the things that we share , are far more powerful and far greater , in order to effect change for the good , not only in Europe but on the world stage . #% It is very important that EU governments and citizens are given time to reflect on the provisions of the draft Treaty . #% I am entitled to my opinion , and so I repeat that this directive has been stripped of all meaningful safety requirements . #% 
Bluefin tuna is the world ' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and , of course , the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons . #% The Commission has consistently discharged its functions as guarantor of the European Treaties in an exemplary fashion . #% We know that the US Government and the European Union could not reach agreement in the Netherlands before Christmas on setting a timetable for the reduction of the use of greenhouse gases . #% Again , it is a case of implementing the regulations that are there . #% The Council has continued and I believe intensified a growing tendency , exhibited also at Cardiff , to carry forward innumerable key issues for future presidencies . #% Madam President , like other Members I would like to wish the Dutch presidency the very best of luck in a very important year for the European Union . #% If carbon dioxide is not reduced , the Arctic ice cover will disappear . #% Firstly , when did it become a sin to be radical ; when was it ordained that we should not try to create something new and different and , when we see mistakes , not try to right them ? #% We should never start at a consensus , but we should always end with a consensus and compromise . #% We must also recognize the leadership of Chancellor Kohl . #% The barriers of the past in Ireland will be eroded and a new Ireland will evolve . #% How can we create confidence in our legal and police institutions to identify and prevent the flow of paedophilia ? #% The best thing that we can do today in the European Parliament is to encourage Prime Minister Zapatero in his efforts to bring together what were previously irreconcilable peoples to find a common way forward in the Basque region . #% So , there is a great diversity . #% We are fortunate to have people who give so freely of their time . #% I sympathise with the Commission . #% I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the significant contribution of women to the work of voluntary community organisations . #% I wish to thank Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for her detailed , informative reply and to assure her that I am aware of the serious concern with which she has always treated this matter . #% The European Commission has already given approval for marketing support to small regional airports because of their importance in creating tourism and economic development . #% I am pro-American , but that does not mean that I am not going to question the US Government for the presumed use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation , illegal detention and/or torture of prisoners . #% It seems to me , for example , that the problem exists , not just within the European Union , but with citizens of the European Union plying this terrible trade outside the Union where a single market does not exist . #% We are all aware that President Bush is due to meet the European Union leaders in GÃ¶teborg this week . #% In my view only nation states can and should represent their citizens in the United Nations , with each free to determine their own foreign policy . #% If they are serious about Europe and creating a Europe of states and peoples , then we must ensure that equality , cohesion and solidarity rule right across the Union . #% Those problems always go back to the same two causes : PVC contains chlorine , and requires the addition of a wide variety of hazardous additives in large quantities if it is to be functional . #% Mr Trichet , only a few weeks ago you called upon European consumers to open up their purses and spend more , but there is not enough certainty in the current economic climate to facilitate the surge in spending that you call for . #% The PPE and PSE refuse to acknowledge a link with the BNFL MOX shipments to Japan . #% What are the consequences for long-term food security and quality , not to mention the role of farmers as managers of the environment ? #% I urge the remaining countries that have not made their global commitment to combating climate change , to do so , via the Kyoto Protocol . #% Therefore , my group will be voting for the compromise text debated yesterday . #% If the impact is found to be negative , we want a renegotiation of the agreement to eliminate those fishing activities which cause the problems . #% However , it is also clear that there have been unaccountable and unacceptable actions within the Commission that have jeopardised the reputation and the good name of the institution . #% I would like to thank you for your various answers here tonight . #% They too stand exposed as the grubby gangsters that they are . #% Does the President-in-Office agree that rural tourism must be prioritised in the context of the broader EU tourism package and that agri-tourism must be promoted and developed as a means of sustaining farm families and rural communities ? #% I look to their support and cooperation in this regard . #% If it is of any comfort to her , the Irish have not got their channel yet either . #% The majority of the people in my own country support our Minister for Finance and the only people who do not are those in opposition in my country and they are using the recommendation of the Commission for what they deem to be short-term political advantage . #% Madam President , can I welcome the forbearance and patience shown by the Commissioner 's staff during the last seven months . #% This single card will at least eliminate a lot of those difficulties . #% 1.8 million people died in 2002 from tuberculosis alone ; 2.2 billion are at risk of malaria , which is preventable and curable provided that sufficient ACT or the new combination therapy is made available ; 39.4 million people are living with the HIV virus , and last year alone 3.1 million died from AIDS , mainly in sub-Saharan Africa . #% There are over 50 000 carers for dementia suffers and an estimated 100 000 people are directly affected by dementia . #% As a result , two fraught days were spent in Copenhagen negotiating a financial package , with divisions at one stage threatening to stall proceedings . #% I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water . #% We are seen as passive bystanders . #% I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs JÃ¶ns , my own Group , Commissioner Å pidla and the Council for largely agreeing the amendments which Parliament put forward and which the Commission fought hard for . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his well-chosen words here this evening . #% That is the challenge for the future ; that is the challenge that we , as democrats , have to take on board . #% In this capacity I can clearly state that under no circumstances should the EUR 20.3 billion currently being proposed by the draft regulation be reduced . #% Mr President , I hope that Members will not be deluded by the rapporteur 's assertion that the common position respects this House . #% Prospects for progress are bleaker now than at any time this year . #% If we want to achieve our Lisbon goals of making Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2020 , we need a truly unified internal market in our major energy resources . #% I feel it necessary to say this at this time because there are many calls for the return of the death penalty for certain crimes , and I am very glad indeed that the resolution includes a proscription on that . #% Mr President , Mr Rothley 's own-initiative report is indeed most welcome at this stage in the evolution of the single market . #% But if we are going to speak about the future of Europe , then that future has to be based on honesty , on facts . #% I understood that , and Mrs Scallon and other colleagues who are not here have been confused by this . #% Nature is a very powerful force . #% I feel that we are spancelled in terms of our legal powers unless we have Treaty legitimacy . #% Incineration of PVC makes the problem even worse , as apart from the risk of dioxin formation the hazardous residues resulting from PVC incineration may even exceed the quantities of PVC put into incineration . #% All EU countries and an encouragingly ever-increasing number of other states have signed up to the ILO conventions on the minimum age for employment and on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour . #% In this regard , I have two main criticisms to make of Ecofin and European Council work so far - and I mean this in a very constructive way . #% The situation in Germany is particularly difficult due to sheer numbers ; 2 476 redundancies are concentrated in the same area , around the same industry . #% Mr President , I welcome this programme to shift freight transport from road to short sea journeys , inland waterways and rail , and also the aim of holding the amount of freight on roads at the present level until 2010 . #% Frankly , in our opinion , this is not the time . #% in writing . - I just wish to raise one particular point regarding cooperation on taxation between Member States . #% Because it is clear , certainly in the case of Congress , that they are a major influence on the role of the US executive , and we here are a growing influence on the executive , although we still regret the pillar system that marginalises us in areas of foreign policy or in fighting crime , and so on . #% 
Rather , it is being used as a vehicle for rabid anti-Americanism , willing to trade in selective tittle-tattle while operating on a presumption of guilt by the CIA . #% This is serious business and EU governments must look closely at the different options available to us . #% Decision-making procedures must change so that we can guarantee that decisions can be taken within the different EU institutions in a streamlined and structured manner . #% In all our deliberations we have to remember the victims of terrorist violence and , today in particular , the victims of ETA violence in Spain over the last few years . #% A study carried out in Ireland recently came out with the fact that the impact of EMU on tourism , retailing , agriculture , manufacturing industry and financial services was excellent . #% We were there when he was sentenced to prison for a further 11 years . #% I do not agree with the present policy , but within its framework stocks could have been conserved if the advice of the Commission had been taken through the years . #% I would prefer the number of vessels going into these waters to be more transparent . #% Is the Commissioner satisfied that the vigilance and disinfection facilities at all ports and airports in the EU , but particularly in Ireland and Great Britain , are as they should be , and has he a role in that area ? #% I know how difficult this area has been in the past for the Council . #% So it is a source of great joy tonight that we have beaten Spain . #% Our version of social partnership is in many ways ahead of the social dialogue . #% We see the potential and the enormous contribution that China and the Chinese people can make worldwide . #% I believe that we must give more support to the victims , and I think that then clearly identifies who was the victim . #% This is especially relevant in view of the remarks of the French Finance Minister with regard to the impact of abolition on employment and the stated intention of the incoming German presidency who said that they will push for a lengthy delay . #% We must seek to ensure that they achieve in life what they set out to achieve , and not be alienated from us . #% Mr President , the action programme for education and training reflects the need to establish a proper legal basis for providing grants for organisations engaged at European level in the education and training fields . #% Can he confirm to the House that this is no longer on the table ? #% Mr President , I should like to welcome both Commissioners to the House and thank them for their time and assistance . #% The scientific studies commissioned by the Commission highlighted a number of key hazards relating to PVC , in particular during disposal . #% I was torn between whether to vote for or against . #% The Council of Ministers will make very important decisions this week which we know will have a long-lasting effect on the future success and credibility of the European Union . #% I see the family as having a very real relevance both at the beginning and end of life . #% Critical to it also is a programme of sensitising people in trade unions and in employers ' organisations to the fact that there is another half of the human race who are entitled to equality as of right and not just as a privilege . #% So let us have a real and honest debate . #% I should like to lay down a marker in relation to the declaration we have just heard from Commissioner FigeÄ¾ , speaking on behalf of Commissioner Dimas . #% The collapse of the Russian economy and the fall-out from BSE are just some of the problems that are impacting on our beef sector . #% As a European federalist without reservation , I have every confidence in the Irish Government in its intention to help guide and develop this Community in every possible way for the benefit of its citizens . #% It is essential to find a balance between the needs of the fishing industry , the management of resources and the needs of the people who make their living from fishing and its associated industries . #% Present and future actions in the fight against international terrorism should and must emanate from the membership of the United Nations . #% Ideally our children should have both . #% They are for the benefit of business and profit and the consumer is hoodwinked which is completely unjust . #% The ` shortest route principal ' should be secondary to the ` safest route principle ' . #% Rather than reinventing the wheel and coming up with new ideas , we should reinvigorate the whole idea of the roadmap that was agreed between the EU , the United Nations , the US and Russia . #% The issue is that there is an opt-out and it is wholly predictable that the UK has reservations , as you said in your letter . #% As Mr Collins indicates , Ireland has made full and proper use of the structural funds , so much so that if the funds were being allocated in 1996 under the present criteria , i.e. , GDP per capita of less than 75 % of the EU average , we would not qualify . #% Two questions if I may . #% You should know that from Northern Ireland . #% In addition , as well as the rightful emphasis on biodegradability of surfactants , I welcome the change in the review clause in the compromise package to give priority to exploring possible needs for phosphates legislation within three years rather than five . #% Cost-cutting and cutting corners caused the biggest environmental disaster in history . #% I believe that the Community must be at the forefront in international efforts to reduce atmospheric emissions from marine vessels . #% Mr Rothley is to be complimented once again on his wisdom and competence . #% In relation to the latter part of the honourable Member 's question , if he puts down a separate question I will try to deal with it . #% A similar fate must not befall the groundwater directive . #% Over the last couple of years , information exchange in the area of judicial and law-enforcement cooperation has become a high priority for the European Union and its Member States in the crime-prevention and crime-fighting potential . #% I believe that those who disagree with me have a right to their views . #% I see it as imperative that all future legislative impact assessments should take into account the increasing level of global competition . #% Mr President , cooperation in the field of education in Europe has brought many students together from different parts of the European Union , as well as students from the accession countries . #% There has been some talk recently in certain quarters that the Commission was considering taking action against Ireland for failure to implement new legislation , which is currently going through the national parliament in Ireland . #% We have to establish a system by which traceability of food , wherever it comes from , will be assured and we have to reach an understanding with our competitors in the world markets . #% To think that what happened in Gaza with Hamas was an accident is to misread , even with the gift of hindsight , our own failures in the European Union and in the US to deal properly with the solutions that may be required . #% It is known that countries like Australia , Brazil and others want full liberalisation in this sector . #% As I said to you in London last week , I believe we are standing at the dawn of a new future . #% Those working in public enterprises are the concern of many colleagues here . #% Given the importance of knowledge-based industries to Europe and our thriving R&D sector , we can not afford to wait until FP8 to take action . #% This directive is a move towards the new regulatory framework and supervisory framework of the financial markets . #% So a number of factors had to be taken into account in this allocation . #% However , I believe that the idea to establish an Internet charter which will be a legally non-binding document setting out internationally agreed objectives and principles in areas such as taxation , liability , jurisdiction and data protection would be a very good idea indeed . #% As he said , we now live in a world that is totally interdependent , and the problems of one country are problems for all of us , problems such as poverty , hunger , disease , ecological disasters and crime . #% I would ask the President to bring this back to the Council if possible . #% You need only look at everything we have at our disposal , and at the costs incurred in this senseless slaughter of thousands of innocent animals . #% We are doing this in Ireland , and the Information Society Commission clearly recognises the value of public libraries . #% The forthcoming IGC is the biggest challenge facing the European Union as a political and economic body since the decisions were taken when negotiating the Maastricht Treaty to set in train the process of Economic and Monetary Union . #% The honourable Member will understand from my previous answers that the European Union , and certainly the Council of Ministers , sees possibilities for developing relations with Albania and influencing it in that way . #% Again , that remains to be confirmed but apparently there is a spread of sheep from Carlisle to a mart in Armagh , which straddles the border of the Leinster Euro constituency I represent and the exclusion zone . #% We consider that Malta has a natural vocation , both in terms of its democratic institutions and respect for human rights , to form an integral part of the European Union . #%

This was a specific case not a general ruling . #% I also support the approach taken by Commissioner Byrne in guaranteeing that all interested parties are given due representation with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations under the White Paper on food safety . #% Decisions and objectives of the recovery plans can not disregard the social and economic consequences which they will have . #% In fact , within this institution we have voted that abortion should never be used as a means of family planning and that it never should be funded for that purpose . #% The agreement at the summit on the draft revision of the Treaties was a major breakthrough and a special word of thanks is owed to those involved , in particular the government representative Noel Dorr , for the leading role he played in this respect . #% It is important to recognise the tremendous efforts that have been made by France and Finland to reduce their emissions between 1990 and 1995 . #% I hope the Commissioner will feel encouraged by tonight 's debate to continue with infringement proceedings . #% However , the legacy of the years where materials were simply dumped remains and has sometimes returned to haunt us , often with severe consequences . #% Thank you to those who have enabled more money to be spent on the important area of science and society which includes a detailed examination of ethics . #% However , rehabilitation programmes for children , young people and women must be an intrinsic part of this new initiative . #% These realities must temper our discussions at Feira and elsewhere as must also the need to keep in mind the status and role of the United Nations . #% In the Thyssen report Parliament has made it clear that it wants to see an extended impact study in this area . #% If they are practical and realistic , then it will be possible to insist on delivery from all Member States , even those that have difficulties in reaching targets in this area . #% in writing . - I support this allocation of $ 14.8 million of European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGAF ) support to the 2 840 workers of Dell in Limerick who have lost their jobs following the closure of their plant because , rather than Dell , it will benefit the redundant workers directly . #% Unless we target resources to the demand side , we literally can not win simply by tackling the supply side . #% Even then , they will still be highly radioactive for more than 50 years . #% The Commissioner is always excellent on these occasions and gives very generously of his time , as do his officials . #% I submit , therefore , that we need a specific directive in relation to any potential water pollution in the aquaculture sector . #% We are now voting on Amendment No 11 which deletes them . #% What is the point in having the clause if we do not act on it ? #% Now I have listened to what the Commissioner said and I have listened with tremendous interest to some of the things she did say , but she has not given us anything other than the fact that they are going to meet the stakeholders in January . #% Finally , acquisition and possession of child pornography with the aim of handing it over to the law enforcement authorities should be made an offence . #% Mr President , as the Parliament 's mediator for transnationally abducted children , I have been involved in the de Brouwer-Limet case for some time . #% Justice delayed is justice denied . #% Most employees with acute or chronic depression , for example , hide it from their employers for fear of the adverse impact on their careers . #% I wish you success , as I am sure that the future of this new constitution depends on this happening . #% Are you in favour of it or are you against it ? ' #% This is an affront to individual and collective dignity and it gives us at least 15 million reasons why we should carry on with the project that you have highlighted here today , Mr Prime Minister . #% It is an ideal area for the European Union . #% Talk , goodwill and interest are not enough ; we need serious financial and regulatory catalysts to increase research and roll out the development of pilot projects using cutting-edge renewable technologies . #% ` On 31 January both the European Parliament and the Council demonstrated a clear will to find a political solution to the problem of national measures , already adopted by some Member States , to reduce F-gas emissions . #% This would be a fitting way to mark the UN 's Millennium Summit . #% Anyone who has been subject to the lobbying from both sides in this debate will have heard convincing arguments for and against the common position proposed . #% It means that we need to make sure that from the seed onwards there are checks and balances in the system . #% We do not have a great deal of time . #% However , unfortunately , national funding for frontline services to assist women and children is still not adequate , with insufficient shelter accommodation for those at risk . #% On the healthcare side , one important development that can take place is the delivery of health services to rural and peripheral areas . #% Unless the root causes of conflict are addressed , no peaceful solution can be secured between the opposing sides . #% That is why this matter is of exceptional political importance this week . #% in writing . - It is now widely accepted that the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy has failed miserably and the situation in the fishing industry continues to deteriorate rather than get better . #% He has done a splendid job and it has rightly been recognised by Parliament . #% For example , some people have put forward the proposition that ecstasy use should be deemed quite normal in society . #% That is the language of the agreement we made with the Commission and the Member States . #% In addition , Question Time did not start at the time stated on the agenda . #% Would it not be wonderful for us if a Member of this House were to become the constitutional Head of State of Ireland , especially since it is someone who is committed to the ideal of European integration , breaking down barriers , sweeping aside old enmities ? #% Perhaps it is because East Timor is very far away and a very small country , that the crucial issues at stake in this dreadful catastrophe engulfing the country at the moment have been of little concern either to ourselves within the EU or , of course , to the United States . #% That stipulation continues to be breached on a daily basis , but we still pump in aid as if all was well . #% I do hope that this Parliament , which has that responsibility , will undertake that in the course of the next 12 months . #% We have tried to help investors with the contents of the summary and the concept of key information . #% What exactly are we going to do in relation to Lisbon ? #% Perhaps the emphasis could be shifted from Ecstasy smuggling to the major problems of smuggling from areas such as the triangle around Afghanistan , and via shipping routes . #% I realise there will be a debate on this matter , but unfortunately I will not have the opportunity to express an opinion on it . #% We demand to have our say on how this issue is addressed . #% There is no doubt that the operation of the internal market has been a success , particularly over the last ten years , and from an Irish perspective economic success in our country could simply not have been achieved if we were not a Member of the Union . #% I take note of the novel , innovative suggestion of the rapporteur , but I do not support it through the back door . #% I reject this method of paying for BSE , a crisis which cereal farmers had nothing to do with and for which they should not be asked to pay . #% E-mail was non-existent on personal computers worldwide , but this is now changing at an accelerating rate . #% Winter is due to start very shortly in Afghanistan , and these winters are exceptionally cold and difficult . #% Some injuries will happen - we can not prevent them all - but with better understanding of how they happen , resulting in safer products and practices , we can reduce their occurrence . #% I would like finally to thank again the rapporteur for taking on board the serious concerns that we expressed in committee . #% At that meeting a proposal was made that a delegation should go from this House , not to Israel again or the Palestinian territories , but to Dublin to ask the Irish presidency what can be done urgently in the way of conflict resolution . #% It is essential that Member States pay for the cost of new security mechanisms and short-term special measures . #% But we can only imagine the trauma that she has suffered with a death sentence hanging over her head throughout the past year . #% I believe that the five-week period for the changeover is of the correct duration . #% Closing GuantÃ¡namo is not the answer because many prisoners transferred will be tortured elsewhere . #% I 'd also like to take this opportunity to say that I hope our caution also shows our solidarity and fraternity with our Greek and Portuguese colleagues who are having a notably difficult time at the moment . #% 
I urge the Commissioner to take a sound , scientific and evidence-based approach . #% However , whatever the consequences for existing EU members , the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must view current developments with growing alarm . #% Madam President , I want to thank Mr Gallagher for his report and to say that I agree completely with him when he makes the point that we have to accept the scientific information that is provided to us , and that it is on the basis of scientific information rather than political expediency that we must make decisions relating to conservation . #% In addition , condemnation of terrorism rings hollow when they fail to take a strong line against the incidences of state terrorism committed by Israel , which have the potential to create future generations of terrorists in that region . #% We are harmonising the legal systems , whether for better or worse , without proper public debate , without public accountability . #% If we are convinced that CO2 emissions need to be reduced dramatically , then we have to stop tinkering at the margins of renewable energy and to achieve genuine liberalisation for electricity markets . #% Farmers are getting older and young people are reluctant to take up farming as a career . #% Could the record show -- I know you can not go back and retake the vote -- that those Members who voted did so in error . #% I have had at least six families come to me about this . #% But it is equally important that the European Union and the applicant countries get down to negotiating the more difficult chapters of talks , which to date have remained closed . #% On the basis that the sector is likely to enjoy budget stability until 2013 , we must use this time to initiate practical research as to how best to achieve this objective . #% The White Paper proposes to tackle this situation by gradually breaking the link between transport growth and economic growth or an increase in GDP , while recognising that economic growth will generate greater needs for mobility . #% Any proposals that diminish the representation of small Member States within the EU institutions will fly in the face of the principles of equality that are the stated aims of the European Union . #% I know the Commissioner would agree on the need for a framework for energy support . #% But there is also uncertainty in terms of the actual post offices that will be distributed throughout rural Ireland as well as rural Europe . #% In 2009 , I became the first ambassador of Rape Crisis North East based in the town of Dundalk . #% We shall have an earlier review than was expected ; we shall have an update on new technological advances in this area of energy efficiency ; we shall have a report to Parliament . #% What we have done here today is regrettable . #% It will not be economically viable if you do not have enough waste to keep the incinerators going . #% For instance , the US , Canada , Australia and New Zealand have all implemented major legislation to progress integrated management of coastal and marine areas . #% This is extremely damaging to the health and safety of those workers . #% The statements by our European leaders and President Prodi are very much welcome in this regard . #% EU Member States should not allow themselves to be bullied into applying an Agreement which fails to guarantee the data protection rights of its citizens . #% It is quite clear that if something is not done now , at this stage , we are going to have a defence aspect to the EU . #% I am also very concerned about monopolies and cartels in the paper industry , particularly in Ireland . #% Medicated feed must not be used to support or underpin poor farm management or weak animal health and welfare standards . #% I have one amendment to my report and I ask the Commissioner to take it on board . #% Would the President-in-Office not agree that the international community , including the European Union , should do more , because this has gone on for far too long ? #% I mention that particularly as someone from a relatively small state with a minority of all-Irish speakers , although the Irish language is not a minority language in Ireland and is the first official language of the country , with many people who have some words of Irish in general use . #% In my own city of Dublin the number of heroin addicts has been increasing steadily for the last 20 years and is estimated to be about 7 , 000 now . #% It has already made it clear that it intends to promote wider cooperation between law enforcement agencies throughout the Union . #% War is a failure of politics . #% We need an intensive dialogue between times and some intermediate staging-posts at which to make evaluations . #% There are therefore grave responsibilities on us all to persuade the Iraqi authorities to give this full and active co-operation . #% Too many of our European markets are still too fragmented . #% However , a one-size-fits-all policy has proved extremely difficult , as colleagues have said , with 12 out of 15 of the older Member States currently in court for non-transposition or improper transposition of the Nitrates Directive . #% Consumers should be free to choose their own level of potency and nutrients , provided that they are safe and appropriately labelled . #% The cost of both air travel and ferry links has been kept at a low level , partly because of the EU-imposed competition between airlines and between car ferries and partly because of the cross-subsidizing of transport costs through duty-free sales . #% The industry itself claims that fuel efficiency , direct routing and new technology have already achieved a 70 % reduction in aircraft emissions over the last 30 years and that air traffic management , improved holding patterns over airports , and replacement of older planes with state-of-the-art technology in fleet renewal could reduce climate-change impact even further as the number of flights increases each year . #% The practice is amoral , unethical and completely unsustainable and results directly from the Common Fisheries Policy , which criminalises fishermen for landing by-catch , thereby forcing them to discard - fishermen who are desperately trying to make a living while faced with ever-depleting levels of fish stocks . #% At present , consumers are faced with a deluge of marketing ploys in order to entice them to purchase food products . #% So five or six people had questions down to Commissioner Byrne , but none of us were here to ask the questions . #% Consumer and investor confidence is waning , the value of global and stock markets is down too . #% The Committee also intends to introduce a leverage ratio to help contain excessive build-up of leverage in the system and other supplementary countercyclical measures such as capital buffers to be built in good times . #% Let me remind you that in your own Presidency programme , you set yourself the twin tasks of ` increased effectiveness and greater openness in the field of human rights ' . #% Agreeing to the integration of the two directives would amount to allowing hazardous waste to be burnt in plants intended for household waste , and vice versa . #% I am pleased that the rapporteur identifies the links between the issue of renewable energy sources and wider policy considerations . #% We have committed ourselves to fully eliminating the customs duties applied to the export of the world 's 48 poorest countries . #% I am greatly concerned that these basic protections are not sufficiently enshrined in this current proposal . #% From the outset , they will be equals , they will have the same rights as the existing members . #% The former US Secretary of State , Madeleine Albright , considered 5,000 children a month as a price worth paying to get rid of Saddam Hussein . #% This reputation for angling also has a vital impact on tourism in many parts of Ireland , both from within Ireland and internationally , with Tiger Woods one famous regular patron of the Liffey in County Kildare . #% We have yet to see this document . #% Stop this nonsense out in the corridors of this esteemed Parliament immediately . #% That is why the proposal for a biofuels directive is also to be welcomed . #% I refuse to accept that neighbourhoods that exist on a social or economic margin should be of no concern whatsoever to Europe . #% However , the success of last week 's summit in Florence will be judged by many of our constituents by what it achieved for them . #% I regret that tonight we have not had a commitment to do a study . #% We need this information to analyse fully what is happening . #% Many of them are run-away children , sometimes running away with adults , not their parents . #% Reports of planned cuts of up to 30 % by the Irish Government to some services amply illustrates their lack of real commitment to prevention , protection and prosecution . #% Mr President , five years into Lisbon , in Ireland -- and , I wonder , where else ? -- poverty , discrimination and homelessness are alive and well . #% The system is also acting as a deterrent to young people making a career in farming . #% If we fail to resolve this issue before enlargement we will have abandoned the goal of a United States of Europe and replaced it with a glorified large free trade area with additional rules and regulations . #% I wish to place on the record the fact that I did not participate in the vote on the Lambert report ( A5-0333 / 02 ) . #% So much for democracy . #% 
Mr President , I participated fully in the drafting of this joint motion for a resolution on antibiotics in animal feed . #% The Court of Auditors ' report - and Parliament supports this - draws attention to the fact that we should perhaps utilise our resources better in a way that might encourage greater consumption of dairy products on our European markets , rather than subsidising unused quantities . #% The BÃ¶sch report quite rightly praises the cooperation between Parliament and the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman 's office and the invaluable procedure of referring complaints to the Committee on Petitions where they fall outside his remit . #% Why do you always have to be dragged here as a College , as a President , before the bar of public accountability ? #% So we have got to have security of our own food supply within Europe . #% Madam President , I would urge you to consider the position that now exists in relation to the foot-and-mouth crisis in the United Kingdom . #% That should be respected , both in terms of accepting waste and in terms of the risk of waste being transported through our waters . #% During 2005 , some 4.9 million people became newly infected with the virus . #% While it might be very simple to operate , it is not linked directly to land area and does not suit the highly desirable objectives of the Commission to promote environmentally friendly grass-based systems of production - which the Commissioner has just mentioned . #% We should remember that we have evidence to suggest that if conservation measures are properly carried out and control is exercised we can increase the take for European fishermen by something like EUR 5,000 million worth of product a year . #% Mr President , I was dismayed by President Barroso 's contribution at the end of the debate on the presidency 's programme -- particularly his defence of his intervention in Portuguese politics . #% The declaration must now be followed up by real action as set out in specific instruments , realistic targets and effective timetables . #% Member States at the extraordinary summit this week on employment would do well to remember that . #% Commissioner , I would say that the IAEA are not competent to make judgements and pronouncements on health and I ask you to state that the World Health Organization is ... #% This happens in many instances . #% I wish them continued success for the next couple of weeks and that Cardiff will be like the finishing of the Grand National , as was said by Mr Titley . #% Biofuels will contribute to Europe 's energy self-sufficiency , at a time of rising oil prices and in light of the recent controversy over gas supplies from Russia . #% In the streets of Hong Kong we saw Korean farmers fighting for their livelihoods , small Korean farmers threatened by transnational grain corporations which are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries . #% Madam President , I would like to congratulate you on the speech you made the night the heads of government met in Brussels . #% The transboundary nature of the marine environment , which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region , leads to the need for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution . #% The recent nuclear accident in Japan , which we were told could never happen , demonstrates yet again that current nuclear energy production is potentially catastrophic . #% It is equally important that the Commission , as the institution charged with implementing European policies , should have a reputation for efficient , fair-minded and even-handed administration of European policies agreed on in Parliament and the Council . #% It is crazy , and he deserves far better . #% An entity that can not raise taxes autonomously , is not authorised to run budget deficits , has no right to raise a military force and , most importantly , can not act outside the competences given to it by the Member States is not a recipe for a super-state by any stretch of the imagination . #% Unfortunately , while countries like Germany , the Netherlands and the UK received the derogations , Ireland did not . #% I ask all Members to support this resolution . #% The setting up of this new Radioactive Trains Investigative Committee will hear evidence from British Nuclear Fuels and Railtrack , as well as from representatives from local community groups on this very issue . #% Agreement on the final contents of a new revised Treaty must be accompanied by an agreement on the future direction of the major common policies and on the framework for enlargement negotiations . #% But once the US and its European allies took action , the situation changed dramatically . #% I thank the President-in-Office for the continuing support , particularly for investment in Northern Ireland . #% We held three dialogues and several meetings at technical level , both on the contentious issues of delegated acts . #% The regulations and directives enacted through the three decision-making procedures in Europe must be streamlined and simplified . #% Mr President , this debate on Strasbourg is not scheduled . #% In the light of tomorrow 's debate on the competitiveness of the EU industries generally and Commissioner Bangemann 's action plan on the competitiveness of the European textile industry , would you not agree that Eurocoton 's complaint belongs to the past for our industries ? #% Offhand I can recall only one instance where the UN moved from a peacekeeping simpliciter to an operation with an element of peace enforcing and that was in Sudan several years ago and , by all accounts , it was an unhappy and unsuccessful intervention . #% However , there are no international or even European regulations on shark-fishing and these species are also in some cases over-fished . #% We should put in place more resources and more finance for research and development to achieve a traceable vaccine , so we know that animals have been vaccinated . #% No other Commissioner was subjected to this ordeal and it is bitterly resented by those of us who wanted to do this thing properly and to objectively listen to what Commissioners would say about their future work . #% Mr President , the European Union can be justly proud of its efforts to meet the commitments entered into at Kyoto . #% It was suggested in a document entitled ` The future financing of the European Union ' , issued by the Commission before Christmas , that possibly 25 % of the CAP should be financed by the national exchequers of individual Member States . #% It is time that we recognise and rebuild as institutions - Commission and Parliament - our common European vocation . #% Mr President , research carried out in the UK on consumer credit awareness has demonstrated very clearly that consumers need clear , consistent information to be able to make informed comparisons of the products on offer . #% Independent journalists reporting on political trials have come under extreme pressure , while several human rights organisations report that deaths have occurred from injuries sustained from torture while in detention . #% I would also plead for input from those who have to implement this labelling to make sure that it is clear and transparent , that it is of good design and can easily be seen and understood . #% My fear is that some organic produce being imported into the EU is anything but organic . #% Concerted action can have a positive effect , provided it is not founded on the values of the lowest common denominator nor on any retreat from the 1951 Geneva Convention 's fundamental approach to asylum-seeking as an individual human right . #% Restaurants , catering and hospitality services need particular attention in all Member States . #% If I am deaf in Ireland , I am deaf in Europe . #% Bioethanol is one of these sources . #% We still have a lot of work to do in that area . #% The events of the last 10 days have been absolutely terrible for those of us who have held to non-violent and to political traditions over the past 25 years in the most terrible and difficult circumstances . #% Today , as the Prime Minister has remarked , we are all Americans , we are all New Yorkers , we are all Washingtonians . #% As a Member of the European Parliament representing the east coast of Ireland , I am particularly angered by the extent of shipments of nuclear waste within the Irish Sea . #% As far as I am concerned , the Member is pushing an open door . #% It is up to Member States to recognize these workers ' rights to fair treatment and I hope that Member States and the Commission - especially Commissioner Monti , who has been rather intransigent on this whole issue and I hope the message can be taken back to him - can agree that those countries that did not apply for the 1985 derogation should have the right to do so now . #% I must , however , clarify that the preferred terminology is sustainable development or sustainability requiring in environmental policy the promotion or focus on renewable energy sources . #% Funding to improve people 's access to basic health and education must be ring-fenced by including a clear benchmark . #% Last September it published a report stating that BNFL has high-quality management in terms of health , safety and the environment . #% Finally , I am very disappointed that some of my fellow Irish Members in this House did not feel that they could support this being discussed in Parliament . #% To some extent that affects how we can best utilise this area . #% Infrastructure upgrading in candidate countries will require massive investment . #% It is something we have a great responsibility to do something about . #% I would appeal to the President of this Parliament and the Political Group leaders of this Parliament to issue a joint statement to the Iraqi authorities and the Member States this week , urging that Iraq co-operate fully and that we operate entirely through the United Nations , thereby ensuring that international law prevails . #% It is estimated that 1.5 million people have died since the introduction of sanctions . #% But within the House there is a committee responsible for incorporating the substantive work . #% None of us disagree with that . #%
