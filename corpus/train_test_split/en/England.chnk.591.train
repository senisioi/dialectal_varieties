I think of Piper Alpha as one example , and I believe that lessons have been learned from that . #% Indeed , today the President-in-Office of the Council was able to tell us of a very offensive letter he had received from the Secretary of Trade in the United States . #% However , it will , at the same time , provide us with a new ordering for our Rules of Procedure ; it will plug a few gaps and deal with a few technicalities that have been spotted and it will allow the newly enlarged Parliament to have a new set of Rules that has been adapted for enlargement , not least pursuant to Rule 180 ( 8 ) . #% We should give serious consideration to this and not brush it under the carpet . #% I agree with what you said earlier , i.e. that they were saying ` no ' to the direction that the European Union is going in . #% Yet , there is little if any , attempt to impose sanctions against General Musharaf in Pakistan , who is responsible for counter-trading such sensitive technology for missiles . #% I hope that is clear . #% We oppose it because it an undemocratic institution . #% One can say that the position of Israel , at least , was impossible . #% Many small firms will be excluded from low-value sales altogether , limiting the opportunities for new and aspiring artists to market their works . #% I would like first of all to remind Parliament that this report is about ensuring that European Union money is spent in the best possible way . #% That was an error of judgement , and not of legality . #% Mr President , in his eloquent introduction the rapporteur referred to the importance of focus and reasserted the importance of the word `` safety '' being in the title of this authority , which I very much support . #% We have had no complaint in this matter from the Member State . #% Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and I are both of the view that the requests for a new report on the re-evaluation of the approval of aspartame are also completely misplaced . #% I have a problem with NAFO though . #% In parts this seems to be more concerned with protecting the civil rights of terrorists than with condemning their murderous behaviour towards innocent civilians . #% If people would look at what is being done with the buildings : we are trying to reduce the payments over the shortest possible time , thereby reducing the total burden on Parliament 's budget . #% We are consequently proposing to cut or to end allowances which have no continuing justification and to keep and , in some respects , improve those which correspond to objective conditions such as expatriate working life , bringing up children and , typically , having to work in more than one foreign language . #% The Irish thought that the British Government was checking on Equitable Life . #% I very much hope that the Commission will fully recognize the importance of monitoring the human rights situation and stressing the deep concern that we feel . #% The European political process is widely seen as an elite preoccupation of little or no relevance to many outside the political classes . #% What happens if my name is down wrongly and I am arrested for a crime I have not committed ? #% It just seems incredible that in the year of enlargement and of the adoption of a new Constitution not to mention the European elections we should even be thinking about reducing or dropping funding for these emblematic institutions . #% It is not acceptable for telephoto-lens photographers to be sitting up there refusing to move . #% What we see now is untenable ; the unfairness and the inequity have to be tackled and trade is the key to doing this . #% We have heard that the negotiations will be the most rigorous yet . #% We warn that this coalition , if it is formed today , unacceptably legitimises the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation , which bring us together in this European Union . #% These reports state that overcrowding in prisons and discriminatory treatment of political prisoners continue as well as a lack of basic medical care , poor hygiene , torture and ill-treatment . #% My father drives a van , and like many small businesses , he is struggling due to the recession . #% We have failed to control it and we have also failed to provide the necessary border controls . #% Parliament also pushed for the regulation to cover areas of data collection which , until now , have not been thought of as relevant for tourism statistics but which we felt needed to be included as part of the recognition of tourism 's important social , economic and environmental impact . #% One example , and I make no apologies for a blatant constituency interest , is that the remains of the British distantwater fleet fish off Norway , Iceland and various other north Atlantic places . #% Mr Bolkestein said that he can not reveal this information because it could be subject to legal action by the Commission against the British Government . #% While there is far less that government can do to stop people losing their last job , there is a lot more that government should do to help people gain their next job . #% At bottom is the threat of the hold-back of government grant from the colleges . #% Put them in the mining waste directive , Commission , and we will relent on the amendments . #% The concept of a really competitive European agriculture in the world market without subsidy is far from the Committee 's thinking . #% It would involve substantial changes in tort law in England and Wales , for example . #% I am delighted to hear that there is progress being made but there is some scepticism . #% That is why we want the second stage as set out in Article 13 ( 5 ) to be distinct and a commensurate advance . #% The Commission should take the logical next step , moving toward a situation where tobacco competes in the market with no subsidy , if it is grown at all . #% It is important that the Commission is to be on the board of mechanism and , above all , that the rules for the operation of the mechanism , including the terms of the strict conditionality , are prescribed by a regulation proposed by the Commission and codecided by Parliament and the Council . #% There is an EU programme called Interreg -- detailed in the British press today -- which demands the setting-up of ` transnational regions ' . #% In mixed fisheries , you can not discriminate . #% One of the problems we have at summit meetings is that of ideology and dogma . #% So we should ! #% How can the international community , a multinational company and one of the world 's main countries , stand by and watch this happen ? #% We have moved on to getting rid of CFCs , moving on to deal with the other substances - HCFCs and halons . #% We should vote . #% That , frankly , is not acceptable to the European Parliament . #% Firstly , what we do not do , and what we refrain from doing , is as important as what we are positively trying to do . #% It is difficult because the speed of liberalization has progressed at very different rates in the different Member States . #% It is a pleasure to see our roles reversed , since he shadowed me on the report on the overall strategy for the human resource reforms that this House approved at the end of last year . #% The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters . #% If we pass this directive and include natural radiation , this would be taking the ` nanny state ' mentality too far . #% As I have said before and I will say it again , it is now or never . #% I say to Mrs Frahm and Mr Cappato that this is what we are aiming for , and I do not believe the rhetoric you used just now is helpful in such a very difficult situation . #% Madam President , we in this House are all aware of the dangers of smoking , particularly passive smoking . #% Saying that we will not allow our citizens to sexually exploit children abroad fits into that pattern , and the part of Mrs Klamt ' s report that talks of how we must insist that double standards are unacceptable is very well put and particularly valuable . #% Europe needs friends , not enemies . #% Current regulations , for example , specify that an aircraft must be evacuated within 90 seconds with just half the exits open . #% My constituents in Scarborough and Whitby and I are appalled that money languishes in accounts in Brussels when children are dying of diseases that could be treated . #% I was attacked ; I was called a hooligan ; I was told I had behaved like a football supporter . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , in a sense I have an easy task following the last two speakers . #% It is therefore vital that these by-products are monitored and prevented from escaping into the environment . #% 
And , in particular , would he agree , or disagree with the FAO when they say that the trend of further intensification of demand in production is inescapable ? #% I know the Commission is not happy with it , but it reflects the procedure followed by the other agencies in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ' remit . #% We must have clarification of the position of the WEU and the role it is going to take in the European defence identity , and that must happen in Cologne . #% The public learn about Europe through television . #% The second issue is that of buildings . #% Now , I agree with those who say that we should not force the opening of trade and services down the throat of our negotiating partners . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mr Langen for his introduction . #% Indeed it may also be possible to make a significant impact on a whole complex of issues currently of topical interest comprising fraud , money laundering and economic crime of that kind , if the talents and abilities of specific small teams able to operate in different countries can be brought to bear under the control of a single operation . #% I particularly turn to paragraph 9 - property policy . #% There are stories that there was actually an illegal handbook produced by the management telling workers to operate in this way . #% Mr President , for the last two years the British Government has funded ` Operation Scrap-it ' with GBP 7 million -- EUR 11 million -- a year given to London boroughs to cope with the End of Life Vehicles Directive . #% It is on the basis of that constructive dialogue and negotiation , which has lasted over the past five months , that we are now putting refreshed and reconsidered options which I hope will recommend themselves not only to staff in the Commission but to the other institutions . #% Let us concentrate on delivering a real citizens ' Europe , security from terrorism and organised crime and from abuses of fundamental rights and discrimination , and promotion of Europe 's soft power in the world . #% This is an important step in uniting Europe against discrimination . #% We must remember that Community air carriers and keepers of aircraft registered in the Community shall forfeit their operating license where the prescribed insurance cover is not maintained . #% We therefore support the idea of an interinstitutional framework agreement to address some of these issues . #% I entirely agree with what Mr Hindley said . #% Some government opponents , like M.P. Sukatnu who recently died , have spent nearly 30 years in prison . #% It is hard to believe that the charges for which he has been given five years ' imprisonment could be true . #% We accept that Europeans , particularly the younger generation , need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead . #% Our hearts go out to the Iranians who have been injured , detained or had their human rights abused . #% I fully agree with Mrs Karamanou that victims and witnesses should be given better protection and assistance . #% It shows why regional agreements alone are not enough . #% That is really a prize worth having and worth having as quickly as possible . #% What then are the concerns ? #% What will assist us in winning this acceptance is for the Union itself to become a contracting party to the Council of Europe 's Convention - a move that will complement the development of our own fundamental rights regime funded on the Charter . #% We are an entire economic generation behind the United States of America . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Winnie Ewing on her contribution , which I agree with absolutely . #% This is a very complex and important report . #% Please be careful that Mr Brown signs in pen rather than in pencil ! #% Because the economic situation is not good and because we recognise the nonsense of flying empty aircraft , we will support our rapporteur on this occasion , but I hope our caveats to this have been duly noted for future reference , not only in this Chamber , but by the wider aviation industry as a whole . #% In those circumstances , will the Commissioner consider what other actions can be taken through the World Trade Organization , through GATT and in other respects which some of my colleagues have mentioned this afternoon ? #% All of us in this Parliament are united in our determination to combat the drugs trade . #% The irony of the situation would be that African Americans would seek to claim , not Africans , who were not subject to slave trading . #% Her strength and power for evil purposes is matched only by her determination not to find the missing prisoners . #% Europe has a responsibility to protect those people whose livelihoods have been built , at no fault to themselves , on a failing to value the long-term viability of the planet rather than short-term profit . #% Or , to put it as the late , great Elvis Presley would have put it , ' It 's now or never , ... tomorrow will be too late ' . #% I therefore move the deletion of those words , with the support of Mrs Thyssen and Mr Bushill-Matthews , who jointly moved amendments in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy originally . #% For lorries , Labour in the UK advocates the introduction of a lorry user charge , which is to be introduced in 2006 and , incidentally , is strongly supported by the main haulage-trade associations . #% I very much hope the Socialist Group will support the very reasonable ELDR position . #% I am thinking of the case of Mr Zavvos in particular . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , the EU has no competence over sport and nor should it . #% It gets no support from Europe . #% That is not my agenda . #% Turning to lawyers , they rightly get special treatment . #% We have good reason to seek to reduce and control and even eliminate their emission from the industrial installations in which they are used . #% In this regard I welcome the determination of the UK 's PM-in-waiting - Tony Blair - to complete the single market during the forthcoming British presidency . #% This also must surely be a sensible policy to make the best use of our own resources . #% What are these plans ? #% Nevertheless , vital as the role of the United Nations is and must remain , it is impossible at this stage to lay out a precise timetable for a transfer of sovereignty , or indeed to identify the precise nature of a Trust Fund in advance of the forthcoming donors ' conference . #% But that committee has considered further amendments and we are asking for further action in the resolution . #% Yet four years later , not a single developing country has proved able to do this . #% Secondly , how can we gain the confidence of those who could provide evidence against trafficking organisations . #% We now find ourselves faced with a text but without the means either to amend or discuss it . #% There is very little new in it , and I would simply say to the Council that the Wise Men 's report , if it recommends a fundamental change of the Staff Regulations and the way in which the Commission itself operates , will have achieved something . #% How can they do that and the NGOs do that if the way we work and who does what within all of the different units remains a well-kept secret , open only to those lobbyists and those lawyers who know ? #% The first is about the annual report and concerns the agencies and the satellites . #% We need to look more carefully at the kind of tourism projects we want to invest in . #% Rural depopulation is a problem , particularly in my country of Wales . #% We must all be prepared , if that report is negative on any particular country , to take the appropriate action . #% This means that in the new Rules to be published in time for the new Parliament -- indeed , presumably in time for the enlarged Parliament in May -- the figures in our Rules will automatically be adjusted to suit the expanded size of Parliament . #% He produced a report on subsidiarity a number of years ago and from that we can draw some lessons because every single paragraph in his report , if I remember correctly , was amended in committee and then in plenary , by Parliament adopting amendments tabled by yourself . #% I was particularly horrified by the idea of Mrs Randzio-Plath that we should actually enrol schoolchildren as the stormtroopers of this euro propaganda blitz . #% Nothing has changed , because no one has been prepared to take responsibility for Eurostat . #% It would be outrageous to do that in secret and without accountability . #% We are going to have an important second reading and possibly a conciliation , so we still have time to try and get this even more right that we have done so far . #% 
There has been a very sustained lobby of this Parliament by people saying that the common position is fine as it stands , that there should be no change and that it would be very tiresome at this stage if we had any sort of codecision phase . #% Through the use of clear labelling , individuals are beginning to realise that they are able to play their part in tackling the problem of international poverty . #% We also joined with our political group in supporting Amendment 3 as we believe there is a right for all states to develop civil nuclear power , but there is a responsibility for these states to reject the development of nuclear weapons . #% I hope that we can ensure that those TENs revisions properly incorporate the ports , ensure that there are fewer studies , more rail projects , more maritime projects and fewer roads . #% If we do not have any detail on the General Affairs Council plan , can you at least say what kind of structure and shape it will take , what indicators it will be using and the follow-up and monitoring ? #% First , as he said in his answer , there are many ongoing discussions . #% I would like to ask whether this happened as a result of your instructions and whether or not you are prepared to take responsibility for this ? #% Croatia and Bulgaria have refused to sign . #% To do this we have to set every government clear targets to be achieved . #% In historical terms , I think Britain now finds herself very alone , perhaps as she was back in 1940 , but ... #% Our main concern was always about the existence of the provisional legislature . #% Yet you have allowed speakers to speak for over one minute including a rather long and pointless dialogue about the merits of Murcia . #% The buck stops with the Commission . #% They make proposals for further improvement . #% What I know on the basis of precedent , and also the Commission 's assessment of the scope and the depth of the challenges that arise from the forthcoming enlargement , is that appropriate measures will be taken at the right time not only in terms of the recruitment and integration of properly skilled staff from the new Member States but also to assist with the preparation of other areas of expertise - presumably including the Scientific and other committees . #% However , it is unlikely that the real truth will ever be known . #% They are there running their own businesses , having their own taxes and they want to co-opt NGOs to ensure that our European money goes to them to undermine the peace process rather than to support it . #% From that time , we have probably had the longest period of peace and prosperity globally . #% However , the case offers an opportunity to break free from a culture of secrecy and fear and to bring the killers to account . #% Further , since pollution is a practical problem , remedial actions must be practical too . #% Let us remember that all that is required for the triumph of evil is that the good men and women do nothing . #% There is always a case for exceptions as we have seen in the original regulation . #% Failure in Hong Kong will allow the US and Japan to increase trade-distorting domestic support by up to five billion dollars , and Europe by up to 25 billion dollars . #% If there is another edition of this series , it should deal with the long night with Mrs Roth-Behrendt at the end of these proceedings . #% The rapporteur called for companies that have received public aid and have then relocated within the EU to be blocked from receiving state aid or structural funding for seven years . #% Besides the outcome of the working group that I mentioned , the investigation of the matter with a view to introducing European-wide regulation in this field as requested by Mr Fitzsimons is already under way . #% Those responsible are motivated by fundamentalist and extremist Islamist ideology . #% Access to documents regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to hold the EU governing bodies accountable , stimulates greater efficiency and enhances democracy . #% You never think of this when you bite on your praline and you discuss whether or not the chocolate is adulterated by the ingredients . #% . -- Mr President , I should like to express my sympathy to Commissioner Mandelson . #% Indeed , as Mr Papayannakis has said , there have been counter-concessions from the Commission . #% I refer in particular to future enlargement for a country like Turkey , as things stand . #% There are many ways in which this can be rectified and I personally feel the Convention could and should have gone further in this area . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner three questions : #% But what does Europe itself do for those at local level who seek its support ? #% While the army is undoubtedly an important guarantor of secularism and stability , any attempt to undermine an elected government would scupper Turkey 's EU ambitions for good . #% My feeling is only somewhat lightened by the very warm welcome I give to the Secretary-General who is here at the debate and Commissioner Liikanen . #% And , indeed , when did it do so , given the fact that it presumably consulted the self-same national experts who were happy with 350 mg/l when it drew up the directive not very long ago ? #% This adds up to a huge bureaucracy being created , only to come to an end within one year . #% Secondly , because although I can understand the context and rationale for withdrawing the shipbuilding intervention fund , I am nevertheless convinced that we need to have structural measures , particularly in the areas of research , construction of oil and drilling vessels , chemical carriers and cruise liners . #% But certainly to look at the pharmaceutical industry and its effectiveness without placing it in the context of the link between poverty and health , between housing and health , between employment and health , between education and health , means a serious omission . #% In trying to defend an untenable position the Commission has shamelessly sought to gag its own scientific advisers . #% It was all reactionary ; there was nothing proactive in what you put before us . #% At the end of the day it does not matter what nationality we are . #% The multiplier effect is going to mean that the pace of climate change is going to accelerate and there is little we can do . #% We must make sure that we have good administration . #% The largest UK Fair Trade organisation , Tradecraft , is based in Gateshead in my constituency . #% Madam President , I asked for additional speaking time because I am aware that rapporteurs often do not have a chance to reply to particular points which could be cleared up during the debate . #% Finally , I should like to endorse the view expressed in this debate that there are many hurdles to be overcome before the embargo against China can be lifted . #% Mr President , I declare an interest as a director of a television documentary company , in which I am now not very active ; but I retain my concern for the quality of our broadcasting and television . #% As you know , they have been extremely highly contested in the WTO framework . #% It is very timely that this matter should come up because it is nearly ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union . #% The fact that the European Union has devoted very considerable funds to enable the comprehensive land reform bill to be carried out underlines the importance which we have put upon it . #% However , some of my colleagues feel this is the wrong judgement . #% I have two specific questions that I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council . #% Last November saw the peace process gather momentum , with the signing , on 16 November , of a peace agreement between the transitional government of Burundi and the Forces for Defence of Democracy movement . #% Countries can not go away thinking the job is done : the job has not even started to be done , and we have to build upon that . #% The Commission wants the date 1996 plus five years . #% In that respect , it is a pity that MEPs have not been consulted on the joint statement to be agreed next week - especially as , with the Lisbon Treaty , almost all of these matters come within codecision . #% They are helped by a supine media that is only too willing to participate in what is effectively a cover-up . #% I should like to make it absolutely clear that is not the case because our group would certainly not want to be seen to be supporting an amendment by the TDI Group . #% When the bell went off yesterday several of us did not even know where the stairs were . #% It is also important to explain to the House that this Regulation is in any event contained within the parameters of the existing European Community accounting code and that the standards themselves can only be adopted by the International Accounting Standards Committee after a rigorous and transparent process agreed by the IASC in its own properly adopted and legally enforceable constitution . #% Much still remains to be done , to echo the words of Commissioner Nielson . #% I also have concerns about the proposal on animal transport . #% I was in Warsaw on the march that your Government tried to ban . #% 
Madam President , this White Paper between ourselves is worth more than all the recent grandstanding speeches of national leaders , because it combines clarity of purpose with a substantial degree of self-criticism . #% We believe that what we are seeing is -- as has already been mentioned -- evidence of irregular employment and false claims about self-employment . #% It is therefore essential that the JPA plays an active role in shaping and monitoring this process . #% Madam Commissioner , when we go to the Hong Kong Round , in my view you are slightly mistaken to think that reforming the sugar industry will give us a strong position in Europe . #% Although MONUC 's mandate has been strengthened and there are extra troops , they are poorly trained and there is a serious lack of information and technical assistance . #% However , as we have moved on , Parliament has called repeatedly for a revision . #% This is a comment that I think applies just a shade too often where Europe is concerned . #% Unfortunately the position is not hopeful at the moment insofar as the United Kingdom is concerned , but who can tell what might happen . #% The question on PVC softeners in young children 's chewing toys is : Who says there is definitely a risk ? #% I am very pleased with what the Commissioner said and with the agreement that we have reached to secure a second reading confirmation with the Council . #% There is an election going on in Britain and yesterday I was doing my stuff on the doorstep in a country village . #% Third , there should be a denial of all economic and military assistance to and through the present government . #% That is why Oxfam has awarded the European Union its Double Standards Award for rank hypocrisy . #% Appoint the director of the board after open competition and a parliamentary hearing . #% If these firms were able to hire just one additional person , the UK 's severe unemployment problem would , in large part , be solved . #% It is stated that in the second part of question time each Commissioner will answer for half an hour . #% Firstly , we want a real process of conciliation between Parliament , the Commission and the Council in preparing the IGC . #% We have yet again to reinforce the notion that we are making ourselves accessible to citizens , who may not know about this right or how to access it . #% On behalf of the quite large Non-attached Group of thirty-plus Members , some of them refugees from other places , I congratulate you on taking office . #% That would make the European elections meaningful and would actually accord with the views of most people in this House that the business-as-usual approach , the top-down approach , can not be sustained any longer . #% Even if the shortcomings of Member States relate mainly to delays , incomplete paperwork and suchlike rather than to fraud , the general impression created is damaging , and damaging in practice to the EU rather than to the Member States . #% And , in our amendment , the Greens are calling on the EU to ensure a formal mandate and timetable for negotiating future climate commitments with a time limit for achieving agreement at the end of 2008 . #% Finally , we must look at a reform of the financial institutions . #% I again congratulate the rapporteur and ask that we all vote for what was originally a cod and hake report - and make sure that we do have a cod and hake report . #% Today , Europe adds its condemnation of the systematic use of brutal , physical torture by Peruvian security forces . #% However , we believe that for our efforts to be both rapid and effective , they should be planned , funded and executed on a truly international scale , utilising the resources and the capabilities of the whole free world , including the technical genius and the good will of the United States . #% I hope he understands that ; hopefully , this House believes that -- I and my colleagues certainly do . #% I congratulate the President-in-Office for the commitment made by this Presidency to Parliament . #% I have great doubts however about whether the Ecofin Council will maintain the position proposed by the European Commission . #% Why else did 10 % of all the euros issued at its launch suddenly disappear into Russia ? #% We have to extend that discipline to the existing states . #% Companies were meant to volunteer information about what they pay governments so that we in turn would know , and investors would know , just what money changed hands between governments and companies . #% I am proposing we use a colour coding system to do this , not to make a judgment on the product as a whole , but to inform consumers if the product they are buying is low , medium or high in salt , fat and sugar . #% I also see these orders as being extremely difficult to enforce in the UK , for we will end up in a situation whereby an order is handed down by a foreign judge in a foreign land who knows nothing about the conditions of a British town or our way of life . #% An optimistic interpretation would suggest that Europe is now in a strong position to exploit and build on the concessions already secured from China by Washington . #% This method , to my mind , is more likely to produce a result than any other . #% As the shadow rapporteur for my group , my guiding principles have been to ask : what information do consumers want when buying food for their families , and how best can we provide this information ? #% The EU welcomes Tunisia 's record of promoting reform in the Arab world , notably on the position of women and the right to education . #% I stick by my previous words describing these proposals as impractical , untenable and unenforceable . #% I know this House and certainly the people present at this debate understand the problems . #% When you look at the convergence criteria set down in the Maastricht Treaty , it is a remarkable success story for the European Union . #% I think that there are many young people within the Community who would in fact welcome that opportunity . #% We look at the economic provisions rather than the demands of citizens who look to us to improve their lives through the agreements that the EU and its Member States have signed and ratified . #% I very much hope that when we vote on Wednesday we will have reached an agreement between the political groups and between the three institutions . #% We are at a delicate stage in relation to the peace agreement . #% Please , when you vote , take note that 20 of these Commissioners have already said that they intend to attempt to implement the Constitution even before it has been ratified by Member State governments . #% You could not leave messages for the generality on the telephone apart from leaving a rude message on your answering machine . #% In the time available to me I will address just three . #% So much time is spent and wasted on voting as it is and this is a way to get around the rationalisation of the Rules of Procedure we adopted as a Parliament last year . #% Stringent safeguards are in place in the UK , yet one state - France - is going to opt out of the Commission ruling . #% It is unsatisfactory in the approach that the Commission has had to adopt and indeed in the content of the proposal coming before us . #% Parliament should also express its appreciation to Mr Bolkestein and his staff , and to the Commission , for responding to the concerns that we raised about these matters . #% NATO ' s vitality and transatlantic solidarity will only be maintained if NATO remains closely and constantly engaged in current crisis management . #% Whatever the future of such developments , Parliament should insist from the issuers of electronic money , as with a bank or other institutions , that the requirement of public confidence , interoperability and the continuing stability of the financial systems should be met by the competent authorities . #% We need stability among our near and next-door neighbours to be a key priority for the new Commission and the new Parliament . #% Does he still think that German public opinion should be tested on the euro and what does he think the result would be ? #% Mr Bradbourn has made very sensible suggestions and has a feel for the needs of the travelling public , in particular those in cars who are delayed by heavy freight vehicles . #% Some may agree with Mr Seppänen that the agreement is stupid . #% The European Union in this context is facing its most serious crisis of the last decade . #% The mother of one such trainee doctor said to me recently that she had been writing to the British Prime Minister and his wife , Tony and Cherie , to ask if they would be happy if their new baby were to be delivered by a tired , stressed-out doctor in a semi-drunken condition as that described by Mrs Lynne . #% The answer to that is regionalization . #% Many of those hopes had been fulfilled but they are endangered by an inadequacy of funding . #% In the case of the United Kingdom , this accession has brought tremendous benefits to the citizens of the United Kingdom , creating jobs through increased trade , bringing in considerable investment , creating jobs , and benefiting our citizens through increased travel opportunities and education and employment . #% Subsidiarity is something that should be protected . #% We need , however , to recognise this issue is not only a gender issue . #% We need a proper system of immigration and asylum that will cater for the needs of Europe in the modern world . #% 
At a time when governments are trying to cut their budget deficits , we have to look at the costs involved in buying the pharmaceuticals for the health of our nations . #% I take one particular example . #% My constituents expect no less . #% Will he tell us whether there has been any dialogue with the other shipbuilders in the rest of the European Union about this deal . #% According to a recent report in The Lancet by a London-based consultant , as many as one in ten people get blood clots of some kind on long-haul flights . #% We can try and make it happen less often , but it is impossible to prevent . #% I think there is a further problem that the Bureau has to examine . #% British Conservatives believe that this report is an outrageous intrusion into the domestic affairs of the UK and other Member States . #% Losing 20 000 of them a year is unacceptable . #% But we must not lose an even-handed approach , because it will achieve naught if we make the Serbs in Kosovo fear for their future as much as the Albanians . #% I want to see Europe create millions of jobs , too . #% Those are fine words , but here we are with yet another attempt to bulldoze wonderful diversity into a common , harmonised , featureless landscape . #% As others have said , it is essential that we look at ourselves very critically , at least as carefully as we have been looking at accession countries and indeed third countries . #% We all want Romania to join the European Union , but not at a price that is too high for the European citizens to pay . #% That is why it is so crucial for the applicant countries to fully meet the standards required because , if they do not , we run the risk of having a backlash in public opinion not only in the 15 but also in the 10 . #% It is entirely pragmatic and practical that we will initially have a proposal that will be subject to governments among the 15 Member States . #% Some Groups have not had a chance to look at the Ghilardotti report in particular and to debate them . #% Even more serious , however , is the possibility left open in the common position , namely that the self-employed might be permanently excluded from this directive . #% A major supermarket chain recently told me that a quarter of its egg sales are now from hens other than battery-produced . #% In fact , all it is doing is bringing itself and the European Union into disrepute and burdening European businesses with a layer of cost and bureaucracy that they can ill afford . #% As I understand the rule in question , which , Madame President , you are carefully trying to construe , there is at the moment an opinion before you from the Legal Affairs Committee but there is not a proposal as such . #% So please could we put off this debate on the French beef ban , and could we also make sure that the Council speaks in the Papayannakis report ? #% I regret that on this occasion the Council failed to show the necessary leadership . #% What we see are the worst examples of conflict . #% Governments and the Commission of the European Union have a role to play in encouraging beneficial application of biotechnological products by supporting research , basic research , which is independent of commercial concerns and has at its prime purpose the discovery of biotechnological applications which really will benefit the world rather than company profits . #% The many exemptions I shall be supporting show that I consider this approach to be a measured and balanced one . #% This will build on that and also extend this cooperation to citizens and to businesses . #% However , although tobacco was prohibited , alcohol failed to get sufficient votes . #% Low Euro-election turnouts , vocal opposition to enlargement and the rejected Constitution are all , apparently , to be remedied by throwing EUR 235 million at projects to persuade the people that the EU is actually doing something good for them . #% In other words , the priorities themselves do not seem to have guided the selection of legislative and non-legislative proposals before us today , which again gives a somewhat artificial tenor to the selection of the proposals presented to us . #% Amendment No 1 which I moved in the committee and which was carried , would indeed make certain that there could be a single committee responsible for the labelling of products for alcoholic beverages . #% rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade . - Mr President , I have abandoned my prepared text because I have to say something about the proposal to have EU cultural attachés . #% It is now a balanced compromise which allows a significant pre-trade transparency requirement to go ahead whilst at the same time addressing some of the practical problems with the original proposal - as Mr Bolkestein says , ` in a pragmatic way ' . #% The EU institutions show , with unwavering consistency , how totally out of touch they are with the sentiments and views of the public . #% The essential essence of this directive is to address the human factor . #% You even want to increase the scope of the bail-out fund so that , along with the ECB , you , too , can go on buying yet more of your own debt . #% We are building cooperation so that we can finally make a quantum leap . #% I want to see this figure increase and Internet access broadened to as wide a cross-section of society as possible . #% The fact is that we are here now facing a very simple process and yet there are petitions , paranoid talk of plots and industrial lobbies mimicking consumer concerns . #% Just two nights ago a prominent community leader , Virginia Oballer , and her son were murdered in the middle of the night . #% No doubt well intentioned , this report needs to be reduced to identifying and eliminating whatever it is that is killing our bees , and to allow the international community to deal with it , not to serve as an excuse for more and more and more EU regulation . #% The whole thing is completely crazy and it is a tragedy that none of you have done a real job in your lives or you would understand this . #% The solution put forward by the Commission is to use a system of averaging and banking , whereby dirty engines can be set off against clean engines and clean technology can be saved up for the next year and used to produce some dirty engines the following year . #% Why do we use the word initiative in presenting this to you ? #% Instead , the economy is in chaos , with rampant inflation and unemployment and half a million of its people living on the edge of starvation , sustained only by world food aid . #% This is certainly the case in the United Kingdom . #% That is what we are talking about ; that is about us trying to translate hope into reality . #% Neither does it properly address dismantling of ships . #% Fourth , the European Union , and obviously the Commission , will also contribute to work in the other pillars : pillar 1 with UNHCR on humanitarian issues , pillar 2 with the UN and pillar 3 with OSCE on institution-building and democratisation . #% I would like to stress a different word in the title and that is the word `` authority '' , because it is vital that this is a body to which the rest of the EU can look up . #% I very much welcome the Commission 's support for that bizonal , bicommunal , federal Cyprus for which the UN has campaigned for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be working hard to bring about . #% However , I am worried that by taking away the UK 's independent ability to monitor and regulate asylum entrants , we would potentially be exposing ourselves further to the threat of terrorist attacks . #% Powerful international agri-business knows that too . #% Therefore , the Copenhagen figures could not have been maximum figures , since the figures that we have seen since are actually larger . #% Also the Council , who are not represented this evening , but it should go on record how helpful the Belgian Presidency has been . #% They have already tabled a large number of exceptions , a proposal for special and differentiated treatment for developing countries , the aim of transferring discussions into the WTO and a study on the development impact of the agreement , all of which are consistent with our resolution today . #% The EUR 100 million fund , available from early 2010 , is exactly the kind of help that small businesses need at this time of financial crisis when banks are still unwilling to release credit . #% Why , indeed , should we agree a new financial perspective when supervisory and control systems are so blatantly flawed within the Member States ? #% -- Mr President , as others have said , those who have suffered so much in this disaster want more than just promises of support or the transfer of money from one disaster to another -- from Africa to Aceh for example . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I very much support this report and in particular the initiatives behind the ETF Start-up Facility and the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Guarantee Facility . #% That would simply be following the bad practices recently tried out by certain burger chains . #% Mr President , this is not reform , as the Commission itself points out . #% I also have a question about the longer term . #% This would mean that we would have to tell British local councils to initiate policies to remove packaging from the household waste stream . #% He mentioned , too , a separate problem of overbooking hotel rooms and plane seats , which has been highlighted tonight by the problems of MEPs coming to Strasbourg . #% But , alas , it can not be feasible until there is a fully functioning common asylum and immigration system in which there are no artificial distortions influencing that choice . #% 
Mr President , I congratulate the Commission on its radical proposals for decoupling . #% What then ? #% He was then in 1987 sold to another group which was funded and run by Iran . #% Anyone with a chance of fleeing his dictatorship does so , and some are able to build a better life for themselves elsewhere . #% More damage to the environment will probably be done and we have to find a way , without being culturally imperialist about it , to ensure that rapid economic development in the countries of eastern and central Europe does not damage the environment , particularly the natural environment , in the new Member States . #% In summary , this has the making of a good piece of pioneer legislation which will be an integral part of the financial services action plan and the first designed specifically for insurance brokers . #% I have received other information on the results of publication of this proposal which suggests that there will be many unexpected benefits from this programme in industrial applications . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that the statement by Commissioner Fischler is indeed to be welcomed - with the rider given by Mr Hindley . #% If the Palestinian authorities arrest those who continue to attack Israeli civilians , there will be no need for helicopter gunships to attack Palestinian civilian areas . #% The finance here is critical to everything . #% Surely you are not ignoring political signals sent by both the Council - many countries are against this - and Parliament , which , as I said at the beginning , two weeks ago rejected many things to do with the European public prosecutor ? #% We can not do business , we can not appease , we can not reach any consensus with a government which uses children as slaves , a government which represses democracy and refuses to discuss any kind of political settlement of ethnic groups . #% I would like to stress that the opposition to the initial scheme for a health policy unit was not an opposition in principle to an agency established in Ireland or to the improvement of consumer safety . #% As Mr Pérez Álvarez has pointed out this evening , the issue was also tackled in the framework of the directive on temporary and mobile work sites , but in a fairly limited way . #% Mr President , I should like to make a point about the PPE-DE recommended voting list . #% If you now find yourself stuck in an airport , with your baggage gone , your flight delayed , or perhaps cannibalised , you get this little piece of paper which tells you what your rights are under the Warsaw Convention . #% What about the additional cost of this project both for the taxpayer and for the motorist ? #% The first is in contributing to the construction of an international human rights community : in all kinds of ways there has been increasing recognition that Europe must promote international standards of respect for human rights , for instance in the international criminal tribunals on Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , the agreement on the statute of the international criminal court , the Pinochet case , the intervention in Kosovo to stop ethnic cleansing - all these things have been developing momentum . #% I turn now to the other report on the coal and steel part of the budget . #% My own nation of Wales is a case in point . #% It is a challenge that we must face together by intensifying security cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral basis . #% Thirdly , we have to say that we should be offering assistance to the Japanese if they request it . #% Let me make it absolutely clear that I am not speaking as a British Labour Member and , therefore , I can not say those things . #% This is a Commission-style deal which is more suited to a command economy . #% Nevertheless , I felt that the need for a registry of closed sites and previously occupied new sites was particularly important if we were really to establish the full extent of the problem across Europe . #% I congratulate the presidency on getting the form of words agreed in Thessaloniki - that the constitution will be the basis for the negotiation of a new treaty in the IGC . #% So , yes , keeping within 1.27 % must be kept a firm target but at the death it must not become an unyielding barrier that prevents enlargement . #% The vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and also the negotiations we have been able to engage in ensure that when we vote on this report tomorrow we can get a commanding majority across the House . #% I would like to thank the Council too for the adoption of a common position which strengthens the Commission 's original proposal and also incorporates a number of the European Parliament 's first reading amendments . #% It can be a very useful process to use soft law but it can also lead to fuzziness , unclarity and difficulties . #% Many small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the capacity or experience to carry out their cross-border recruitment . #% Lastly , we are adamant that such major constitutional changes require a full public debate in all the Member States . #% The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions . #% The Court has to be fully resourced in order to carry out its tasks in the difficult times that lie ahead . #% How many more blows are our fishing communities supposed to take before faith in the European project is finally lost ? #% Inevitably the then existing Uzbek nomenclatura filled the power vacuum ; hence the composition of the current regime . #% It should be cut up so that I can choose to watch my team 's matches , not get a couple of them and twenty matches I do not want to watch . #% I hope also , as other speakers have said , that the system involving a regulatory committee - a technical committee set up within our institutions - will provide the openness and , most importantly , the democratic accountability that this Parliament seeks . #% Finally , if colleagues are in any doubt about the importance of a separate scheme , they should consider the words of a chief economist of British Airways , who admitted last week that if airlines joined the existing emissions trading system their emissions would simply continue to grow at an alarming rate : they would simply buy up the right to emit as ever , their own emissions would not go down , and we would still see aviation having a massive accountability for the climate crisis . #% Let me explain , because I do not think you really understand . #% As regards prospectuses Parliament should follow the example set by the committee . #% It says that , in a court of law , two female witnesses are required against the testimony of a single male witness . #% We are particularly hopeful that they will look at the suspension of pension rights for the Commissioner in this instance , particularly while he is engaged in a private company . #% I would simply say to him , without softening the attitude of the Commission at all , that in our efforts to try and secure protection for human rights and progress towards greater democracy , the setting of litmus tests is not always well advised . #% Mr President , in the House of Commons the day before Mr Jack Straw , the Home Secretary , and therefore responsible for electoral rules , said that there was no manifesto commitment to introduce PR or the regional list system by the 1999 European elections . #% I am assured that report is wrong . #% Will the President-in-Office agree with me that ferries sailing from the east-coast ports of the United Kingdom to the continent through international waters will be able to sell goods on those ships at duty-free rates , even when the duty-free regime is abolished on 1 July 1999 ? #% Despite a resolution passed by this House on 25 September 1995 , on 5 December 1995 contracts of non-Italian foreign language teachers at Naples expired , amongst them one of my constituents . #% I should like a specific answer please : as regards the post-litigation phase , would you not agree that sometimes that can take several years and then again several years before a penalty is applied ? #% Madam President , would you , as President of our Parliament , consider sending a message of congratulations to Ellen MacArthur , my constituent from Derbyshire who came second in the round the world yacht race ? #% Co-Chairman of the EFD Group . - Mr Barroso , it is very good to see you here . #% I do not believe it should be an EU competence in any case . #% This practice heralds from Spain but could happen elsewhere . #% I have written ` chaos ' in the margin against one set of votes because I did not understand what was happening . #% I am very pleased that the Minister has said that there is further legislation coming forward on Article 13 regarding age . #% The UK Government will add that up to twelve years as against the 13 years which the UK Government was asking for initially . #% I would like to have the Commissioner 's view of what will happen if the Council puts the Copenhagen figures into the accession treaties . #% Sadly , such a sentiment does not resonate in the People 's Republic of China , whose Communist rulers are obsessed with unity , but not much thought is given to celebrating diversity . #% This is cutting-edge technology , and it is very important . #% It is an addition , Mr President . #% Let us give it away ; let us put it on to the Russian market ; let the Russians use that meat to feed their people ; and let us relieve pressure on our own markets . #% There was of course a deathly hush , but such a situation is far from impossible . #% They have been given a false prospectus . #% I have to say it is a pity that the international community took so long to wake up to the situation in Zimbabwe and that the European Union waited until the eleventh hour before imposing targeted sanctions . #% This requires ongoing monitoring and we very much welcome the revision of the series of directives which are the subject of this debate this evening . #% That effectively will be a warning shot across the bows of these blacklisted flag states : over a period of time their ships will be banned one by one if they do not improve . #% 
Nor do its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention apply until an asylum seeker is actually present on its territory . #% Tomorrow we take a vote on a pretty important piece of legislation , Mr Kindermann 's report on animal welfare . #% The British experience has shown that the UK was right to take the bold step of opening up its labour market . #% Our response to the challenges posed by China needs to include a thorough-going reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory until now . #% I find that a very worrying statement coming out of the Food and Agriculture authority and would like to know very much whether or not the Commissioner agrees that such intensification is inevitable or would he agree that there are other alternatives and that those are alternatives that all of us ought to be promoting and pursuing ? #% I pay great tribute to him . #% This concerns budget line 05 05 01 01 . #% Egypt is primus inter pares in perpetuity in the Arab League . #% Let us get that point clear . #% On the day of the election people had freedom , but not freedom of information . #% I would like some clarity on that point . #% I have been very proud to go on a number of election observation missions over the years , most recently in Pakistan . #% These are all serious questions , which we know you will try to answer . #% I welcome Mr Colajanni 's report . #% I can only commiserate with the people of India . #% I congratulate the rapporteur . #% Undercutting , when one country 's defence sector steps in to supply arms refused by another Member State , must become a thing of the past . #% We believe the common position is a considerable improvement on that initial proposal . #% Could I ask you please to put that back on the agenda of the Conference of Presidents this week , so that we can take a decision and also have an ad hoc delegation to Kashmir . #% It seems to us that the summit at Doha represented the coming together of two themes or two trends within the WTO . #% Now remember this is a humanitarian force , which is planning to use a weapon that will leave an enormous legacy of cancers among the very civilians it is supposed to be there to protect . #% in writing . - We are obviously in favour of Frontex exercising surveillance beyond the territorial waters of border EU states . #% From Penny Black to EU attack in 166 years ! #% However , it would undoubtedly be more prosperous and secure if it did not suffer from an artificial territorial division . #% I hope , Mr President , that , when the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly , over which you preside , meets in Brussels in a few days time , we will hear a statement from the Commission and the Council on precisely what happened , why it happened , when it happened and who took the orders . #% And , of course , minimum income harmonised across the EU will be followed by a harmonised tax system , reducing all to a grey amorphous mass , devoid of Europe 's greatest property : diversity . #% Secondly , I would like to mention that our committee wishes to maintain all its amendments at this stage , especially those relating to Eurostat . #% In addition the Commission failed to check that those particular regulations were being implemented . #% It is so important to keep in the European Union , both for the European Union and , above all , for consumers who want safe , effective and affordable medicines . #% I should like to thank Mr Byrne for his very comprehensive and thoughtful reply . #% Mr President , the G8 leaders in Scotland are exercised about the sustainability of our world . #% We acknowledge where further development needs to take place . #% The principles of the code will be constantly undermined if action is not taken to control and license arms brokers . #% This shows the seriousness of the situation . #% I welcome the fact that NGOs are funded through the exclusion and anti-discrimination action programmes . #% They relate in particular to the later paragraphs , from paragraph 47 onwards . #% To dismiss it out of hand would be dangerously short-sighted , and would only perpetuate Kosovo 's state of limbo in terms of international recognition at EU , NATO and UN level . #% That is why I particularly support the 1997 Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty on the prohibition of the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of antipersonnel mines and their eventual destruction . #% We have to start telling people the truth . #% As we know , along with the CAP , regional funds represent the biggest part of the EU budget . #% The Commission and Parliament are better placed to deal with these difficulties , but meetings of ministers flying in for a short time to Brussels , when it takes half a morning just to have a tour de table - really provide the Council with a challenge . #% That was the reality . #% It is not acceptable for governments to put the blame on OPEC , on oil companies , on peaceful protesters , on other political parties , or even on the European Union for protests about levels of taxation that are too high . #% Let me quickly take up one other point : better regulation . #% It is certainly nice to see the professionals back in charge of the shop . #% He is the only acceptable Afghan figure who can unite all the warring factions and demonstrated the ability , when he ruled his country between 1933 and 1973 , to rule constitutionally with tolerance and moderation , even using the English model of sport as a way to unite the disparate ethnic groups . #% It is interesting to hear that you are going to check the receipts of Commission monies - who gets contracts , where tenders go . #% And who sits in the Council ? #% In my opinion it is disproportionately eroding our credibility with European citizens and provides opponents of the Union and national governments alike with an easy alibi on which they can blame all evils . #% Mr President , in common with many other people , this is positively my last performance in this House . #% In order to do that , we have , of course , started with the child . #% If the European Council is to have a semi-permanent president , it should be someone who takes a low-key but practical approach to building a consensus among the Member States where this is possible and desirable . #% One in three of us will probably , at some point in our lives , have cause for concern , and indeed thanks are due if we have managed to make headway in that field . #% Whole-herd slaughter has no scientific justification . #% I would like to put it to him that at the moment impact assessments that we receive attached to Commission proposals in many cases are not thoroughly done , they are not looking at the full implications , they are not necessarily independent . #% There is a tragedy brewing in the Congo , but the proposed international deployments do not address this . #% This would be a small but significant step in the right direction and , by increasing cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament , it would allow national MPs a real say in the workings of our Union . #% We had the welcome news in Geneva that South Africa , for example , wants to join that network . #% It was aimed at the extractive industries because it was clear that this was an area in which an awful lot of money was going abroad , away from the countries where it should have been used . #% Would you please repeat your invitation to him to take the microphone . #% There are two questions . #% - This resolution contains many points that I fully support on the IGC , on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and other aspects of Community policy . #% Yet it is not a position that Europe could or should have followed . #% Mr Stevens ' comments are more a courtesy to his leader , Mr Hague , at home in Westminster . #% Every possible effort must now be made to end this war and sanctions must be tightened . #% I therefore urge and plead with the Commission : please do something positive as a result of this debate and this vote today . #% 
The European Parliament and the EU generally protest against the use of the death penalty throughout the world , whether it be in the United States , China , Japan or anywhere else , and Iran is no exception . #% The question is what can the European Union do to help us . #% I agree that the key to feelings of closeness with the European Union hinge on information . #% Could you tell me what kind of mandate you will give the Commission to incorporate clauses that are specifically salient and relevant to the issue of Syria 's biological and chemical weapons stock , and whether the Syrians will be encouraged strongly within these clauses to effectively dismantle them and avoid any proliferation of such dangerous weapons ? #% One of my colleagues in another parliament , of which I have the privilege to be a Member , always says ` the one way of identifying things when you are wrong is when everybody is in agreement about it ' . #% It was always possible for the Swedish Presidency itself to put the item on the agenda . #% I am duty - bound to say to this House , there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered , or indeed the action taken , by the Commission on this issue . #% You know as well as I do that the gap between what you want and what the ordinary voters want is getting wider . #% Needle-stick injuries are the most common and most dangerous form of medical sharp injuries . #% Among the British subjects were two of my constituents , Paul and Lesley Coppin from Mildenhall in Suffolk . #% Behind those principles there is also a very clear statement of priorities from Mr Viola . #% What we need is action - to ban the flags of convenience in our waters ; to improve our port state control ; to ensure that the ships of shame are detained ; to ban all single-hull tankers ; to ensure that those responsible for these disasters pay the full cost of the damage that they caused ; and last , but not least , to ensure that the Prestige is the last tanker to spread its black death over our coastline . #% You said yourself today -- in that most incredibly arrogant speech -- that the whole process of political integration will continue regardless of what the people say . #% Last year 38 % of the annual export earnings of US$ 700 million was pre-empted for debt servicing . #% We are recommending that it is set up to try not just Saddam Hussein but all of his officials who have carried out gross violations of human rights , both inside and outside of Iraq 's territory . #% The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater , the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals , which we all need in society in all circumstances , should not be finding their way into our water system . #% Let us move ahead ! #% Simplification of certification procedures , transparency and price predictability are all things that will benefit the consumer . #% I just want , on this last occasion , to say that many of us in this House have invested a lot of ourselves in the REACH process : Guido Sacconi and many colleagues have laid the foundations for a safer , better chemicals framework . #% I would urge the Commission to be more relaxed about it , to listen to the code that is proposed by the Ombudsman and endorsed by this House , and to accept it . #% It means that if you restrict yourself to using just existing stem cell lines created before the date stated by Mr Nisticò and others , you will be confined to using ageing stem cell lines from the USA that have been made by using mouse-derived proteins and that are not suitable for treatments for human patients . #% I hope the House will give an emphatic welcome in the vote tomorrow . #% As the market gets bigger , there is a temptation for more and more players to want an ethical label , but they do not want to pay the real price . #% You can be sure that any new EU law would be gold-plated and rigorously enforced in Britain but ignored in other countries . #% It is very important , particularly when we are urging the applicant countries - and indeed countries which are not yet applicant countries - to address certain issues , that we should be prepared to look openly at ourselves . #% Of course , the industry 's efforts to reduce its emissions are welcome . #% Yet the Constitution , however you look at it , is to a large extent discredited . #% The Commission has said that it has made a firm agreement with the Council and is sticking to it . #% Secondly , the rapporteur is moving his Amendment 42 , calling for bans on lead and cadmium in power tool batteries . #% Mr President , a rhetorical question often rhetorically asked is : which came first , the chicken or the egg ? #% Such a step would certainly underline the fact that Albania continues to fall well short of the EU 's expectations . #% My final question to the Commissioner is to ask what he and his services might do to support that initiative . #% That is why the ELDR Group is especially keen that the somewhat stalled talks in the interinstitutional working group , which is looking at the way in which we all collectively improve our law-making capacity , should conclude as quickly as possible . #% Mr President , on behalf of the PSE group I would like to join the rapporteur in thanking the Commission for this important contribution to the debate on the maritime sector and its future and in particular , the role of short sea shipping . #% in writing . - The comment ` if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day , while if you teach him to fish you feed him for life ' is all too apposite to this debate . #% I make the point in reply that what we need is a true cost-benefit assessment that takes account of all the costs and benefits . #% We are on the threshold of an era - which , I believe , in the next few years will include all 15 Member States - an era which will bring employment and prosperity to Europe in a way we have never seen before , and give the people of Europe a weight and an influence in the world commensurate with their importance . #% Whenever the EU starts talking about creating a level playing field it reveals a fundamental ignorance of enterprise . #% Parliament has consistently called for a widening and rigorous enforcement of sanctions , as well as other measures , to make international action against the Mugabe regime more effective . #% There is a very strong argument for saying that the single currency can not function properly unless there is increased political integration and political union . #% I commend this motion to Parliament . #% How much of this schizoid quality reflects the positions of the two rapporteurs is hard to estimate . #% Firstly , within the proposals before us , the Commission attempts to accrue more power for itself . #% Like Mr Parodi , I was pleased that the Council , with the support of the Commission , has incorporated most of the ideas and objectives of the European Parliament in the first reading . #% Everybody involved will tell themselves how jolly hard they worked . #% Government studies in my country suggest that ozone may lead to the premature death of 12 500 people each year . #% Whilst that most obviously refers to matrimony between two heterosexual people , it also relates to homosexuals if homosexual marriage is legally recognised in a Member State . #% It is counter-productive to approach such an important issue as religious fundamentalism with a tirade of political fundamentalism of the kind that this report is largely made up of . #% Paragraph 51 refers to the right of people who are arrested and imprisoned abroad not to have their trials indefinitely delayed and to suffer thereby because of technicalities like lack of translation facilities and lack of understanding of the legal systems in other countries . #% The protection of the diverse market in Europe remains crucial . #% There is no example of a common fisheries policy ever working effectively , so the CFP is fatally flawed by virtue of the fact that it is a common policy . #% In 1999 the European Union forced Britain to adopt a form of proportional representation for the European parliamentary elections . #% However , I must say that , in terms of this legislation being forthcoming from the Commission , we have had to wait quite a long time . #% There is no point in having new rights for consumers unless they can be enforced . #% Often in the EU , we believe that the is an menu from which we can pick and choose what we like . #% The series of reports we have before us this morning attempt to move things forward . #% Now , two years after that date , we are still waiting for something to happen . #% It also has a track record , no doubt worsened by its desperate self-inflicted poverty , of exporting arms , including weapons of mass destruction , to any willing buyer irrespective of the danger posed to world security . #% Unless they are prepared to accept the conditions we negotiate , it will not happen . #% Will the Commission be prepared to send envoys to the ASEAN countries and to Japan to discuss the options which we face ? #% These containers are a menace to navigation , they could pollute the seas with both toxic and non-toxic materials , and they leave local authorities with large clean-up costs . #% We are moving towards management by objectives ; transparency whereby both staffing , administrative expenditure and substantive expenditure are now exposed in the budget remarks . #% I would raise some concerns about the Commission 's powers of enforcement in terms of infringement proceedings as we move towards enlargement . #% When we talk about the Iraqi people let us not forget the 750 or so Kuwaiti prisoners of war still inside Iraqi prisons . #% That kind of situation , President , shames us all . #% In fact , Mr Miller should be receiving an invitation from me , so I am pleased to say that I had already anticipated what he was going to invite me to do tonight . #% 
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez for her report and I have noted with some interest that she has pointed out some of the facts that I pointed to three years ago when I was asked to write a report on potato starch quotas . #% That is our challenge to them : to make sure they adhere to the very worthy agreement that we are hopefully going to be endorsing this week . #% It is an opportunity for President Mugabe to make the decision once and for all to step back from the brink , as Mr Van Orden has clearly said . #% I expect it is going to be possible to ring-fence the classical constitutional provisions that we find in the first and second parts of the Constitution , around which consensus still exists . #% We do not want our money spent on promoting it either in the UK or elsewhere . #% I draw your attention to the fact that alarming events have been taking place in Moscow in the past 24 hours , mainly aimed at the independent media and the freedom of the press . #% Europe and America diverge on a clutch of important questions : trade ; science ; fundamental rights ; climate change ; monetary policy ; competition policy ; foreign , security and defence policy and the Constitution . #% The promoters see it as more important to have the kudos of an exclusive body than the reality of an across-the-board transformation of society . #% This is about - and I quote - ` air emissions and environmental taxes ' , just as the last speaker said . #% We have constituents from East Anglia , from Cambridgeshire , in the Parliament here today and , like me , they wonder when the Government is going to appoint a minister for homeland security . #% I fully support the rapporteur 's point that there should be national support schemes . #% What this place knows about running small businesses is absolutely unbelievable . #% If we can make progress in improving the returns for pensioners in private schemes across the European Union , we should do so . #% We have heard already about third-country nationals and the legal base which should be applied to include them in the scope of the regulation ; the comparative lack of progress in including accession countries in the coordination process ; and the update of the regulation in my report to bring it into line with the changes made in the social security systems of certain Member States . #% Parliament will vote today on whether to have a say in the priorities and running of this programme , the European democracy initiative , because the resolution put forward by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy today points out that this fund , which uniquely requires no host country consent , should be more focused , especially on what I describe as the ` arc of instability ' from Russia to Morocco , where democracy is fragile , or on the Arab world , where it is non-existent . #% With central and eastern Europe gaining enormous ground , it is also very true and quite proper that we should look for observer status for them and involvement around the table , to allow an effective process of change and adaptation . #% That seems incredible in terms of the subsidy we offer under the common agricultural policy . #% This is a battle which we may not be winning now , but which we must not lose . #% The State Peace and Development Council - the former SLORC - has harassed the people of Burma , the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi . #% I and my committee want to work with the Commission and the industry to develop a safe , integrated , interoperable railway network . #% The UK 's department for international development is on record as saying that development there is dependent on the relaxation of Israeli curfews , closures and checkpoints , and eventual withdrawal . #% In very broad terms , I welcome the Commission proposal to bring flax and hemp into the arable area payments scheme . #% Thank you Commissioner for your answer . #% It is true that there are few issues of disagreement , but they are certainly extremely important ones . #% Sound employment practices and good working relationships with employees are key indicators for such ethical assessment and we need to see the recommendations in the report in that light . #% We have heard some amazing things from Mr Pirker , Mr Santini , Mr Blokland and others which make one wonder how they chose to interpret the remarks in this report . #% The PSE therefore welcomes the fact that , on top of the payment of ECU 540 000 to the government of Comoros for fishing rights , there is a commitment of an additional ECU 540 000 for direct support for the Comoros ' own fishing industry to support the programmes mentioned already by Mr Macartney . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , I , too , would like to add my voice to that of others who thanked our rapporteur for the very good work that has been done on this report . #% If that is the case , could you please ensure that these are the final conclusions and that they are available to all Members as soon as possible ? #% President Mugabe has just returned to Harare from Johannesburg claiming support for his land policies . #% Though agencies like Oxfam are seeking to help 8 000 families per month , over 400 000 people have lost their belongings or their livelihoods . #% Sadly , no sooner had we adopted this report than the Andizhan tragedy occurred . #% We must acknowledge that any knowledge acquired that is superfluous to the inquiry or gratuitous should be disclosed immediately . #% Firstly , we appreciate the need for adjustments to be made to financial and economic policies over time , but the use of ` revision ' implies a fundamental departure from them , as Mrs Figueiredo effectively acknowledges in her speech . #% So we support the measures set out in the report and call for this action to be taken sooner rather than later , because this is discrimination that women have faced for a very long time . #% Too often there are those who seek to apologise for or justify terrorism and abuse the human rights , civil liberties or anti-discrimination arguments in order to provide protection or legitimacy for terrorists whose causes they happen to favour . #% The United Nations agreed in 2001 to consider proposals for an international convention to promote and to protect the rights of people with disabilities . #% I will , however , respond to it in the interests of transparency . #% It is a vicious and cruel approach . #% I just wish to thank the President-in-Office for the excellent , lengthy and detailed answer on this important subject . #% As long as these risks are ill-defined , it is right that the Commission should introduce legislation to mark these risks quite appropriately . #% For example , it calls for the publication of information on the number of licences refused , stating the reasons for refusal . #% What we need is a comprehensive worldwide agreement . #% Well , as parliamentarians we are doing what we can to increase that room , but can I ask you specifically what you are doing to increase that room for manoeuvre ? #% Thirdly , minimum indicative levels act as a reasonable guide in the UK for personal consumption and help the UK authorities to fight fraud . #% Thirdly , would he agree with me that the logic followed through by my colleague Mr Titley , is that we really ought to be thinking in terms of having an independent regulatory assessment unit operating institutionally , which would provide a true external verification on impact assessment for all the European institutions ? #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I should like to thank my colleagues , and Commissioner Dimas , very much for their comments . #% I would also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for having come from Switzerland late yesterday evening to inform us of the situation regarding the talks with Cyprus , which is intimately linked with our debate this morning . #% Labour MEPs did not move a single amendment to bring the proposal more into line with their Government 's wishes ! #% Firstly , Liberals attach great importance to rules ; here we are seeing a consistent , persistent breaking of the rules . #% The Socialist Group fully supports the condemnatory nature of the remarks made . #% But as we are trying to change what the Irish said in their referendum , maybe we should look at the British vote . #% Nowhere is this more obvious than in Iran . #% I would like to remind everyone that the Commission will be producing a further progress report six months before the date of accession . #% That is to be welcomed and it will enable our farmers to plan . #% Over the weeks that follow , many Thule workers were involved in the clear-up . #% As for the schools , I would point out that the fact that four of the schools have more external pupils than Community pupils poses a problem . #% Mr President , I welcome Mr Friedmann and thank him and the Court of Auditors for their report . #% Mr President , as second Vice-President of the Joint Committee with Slovakia I regard myself as a friend of Slovakia and the Slovak people . #% So I seek further acknowledgement of the problem . #% How does it look in our first year if we do not fully commit the funding and meet our obligations ? #% If money can not be spent then we will look at those areas where it may have to be reduced . #% There can be no fudges whatsoever during that process . #% I suggest that first you ought to put your House in order . #% To help it on its way the PPE-DE Group is calling for a roll-call vote on this particular amendment but will then abstain so that the amendment will fall . #% A strong vote for this resolution will assist the Convention to complete its task and set criteria for this Parliament ' s final appraisal of the results . #% 
It seems that at the beginning of the week there was a great deal of concern that we speak about this issue and we have been going at a snail 's pace today . #% We have seen that handed from Mr Pasty to Mr Andrews . #% It is those ordinary people whose interests are under threat . #% In one case in which I was concerned , the Commission official , when questioned in committee , said that the EPAs are not only about trade ; they are also about regional integration and exporting the EU model . #% In the week that 600 people lay dead after the earthquake in El Salvador , this European Union must be able to move more quickly just as we failed to do in response to the impact of hurricane Mitch in that same country back in 1998 . #% Mr President , I want to thank the rapporteur for the way in which he has approached this complex issue and his willingness to entertain a wide range of reservations across the Committee and where possible to approach these efficaciously ; and also my colleague , Mrs Van Brempt , for her work on this . #% Salmaan was a man of charm , charisma and high intelligence . #% Now Amina Lawal faces the same threat of death by torture . #% I am interested in understanding how this links to the current treaty requirement in Article 6 to integrate the environment into policies and practices of the European Union . #% This is a very important report in terms of completing the internal market for motor vehicles . #% Others have mentioned the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit but there are other needs for a conclusion : the needs of industry for early clarity about the new rules , the need of European citizens for cheap , efficient competitive telecommunication services , the needs of European Union businesses for education , for research , for societal applications . #% No decision has yet been taken in my group as to what buildings we need . #% I am extremely grateful for the constructive approach taken in this report and , indeed , the improvements made on the original proposal , because it has received close and enthusiastic attention from Members of this House . #% Indeed the solution for the euro is to recognise the need for full political discipline in combination with full market discipline . #% However , as we approach the Spring Council next month , it is vital that national governments get a grip and push ahead with the economic reforms that are vital to the future prosperity envisaged in the programme . #% I know you have already met the new Polish leader , but the public at large needs to be able to see in practice that we have a vision of a fully complete , united Europe and that you , Parliament and the Council are working together to achieve this . #% in writing . - In recent years , general and business aviation has been the fastest growing branch of the aviation sector . #% It is true that non-state actors can suffer from the same problems of bad governance for which we sometimes criticise governments of developing countries . #% This is a sensible measure ; yet this relatively straightforward technical measure has already taken 18 months to get to this point of second reading . #% Let us consider the facts . #% This loss , which flowed directly from what the government was doing and was entirely foreseeable , was equally real . #% I want to thank the Commission for its full reply . #% Those of us that joined later should remember why we joined and the efforts that other countries made to integrate us successfully into the Union . #% There is also the Liberal Group 's amendment which would establish joint liability between the producer and the seller who has ceased trading or does not know of the claimed lack of conformity . #% However , most importantly , we are concerned to look at the work programme which is set out and properly costed . #% The EU can be proactive by breaking down some of the taboos around violence against women - and men . #% Meanwhile , the funding plans of this grandiose project , which will run into billions of euros , are encountering severe difficulties . #% The model itself is failing and yet what you want is to double the size of the bail-out fund . #% Mr President , Mr Bourlanges should be congratulated on having drafted a good report on an extraordinarily complex set of questions . #% It is ` stability ' , is it not ? #% We have adopted resolutions on this subject time and time again . #% Worrying , because a domestic trial in Cambodia is unlikely to bring out the full facts of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge in the years of the killing fields in the late 1970s . #% That is undemocratic and , at a time when everyone talks about making the EU more transparent and closer to its citizens , this move smacks of hypocrisy . #% In addition to this , the final report failed to acknowledge the amount of money being wasted on Strasbourg . #% We are very keen to ensure that development policy is not ghettoised into one little bit of the Commission , and that its objectives are mainstreamed right across EU policies when we are dealing with the developing world . #% However , this report says that the clause must apply in all countries equally . #% We want answers today if at all possible . #% On specific points , Mr Kirkhope referred to his anxieties about paragraphs 11 and 12 , and I know the points that he is making there . #% On Sunday night I was rung up by the BBC World Service who wanted me to give a quote on the position taken by the Turkish Government . #% I compliment the rapporteur on her report and all the work she has put in . #% Mr President , I sympathise with the Commissioner over the vagaries of temperature in this building . #% Secondly , I am very grateful to Commissioner Wallström for her comments and for agreeing to incorporate much of the report into the Commission 's thinking about evolving and developing the Northern Dimension into the future . #% Even if electoral observers are allowed in , we must maintain the pressure on Mr Mugabe to deliver free and fair elections . #% Well , British Conservatives have been saying this for years about the European Union as we have led the way here in the fields of liberalising our economies , deregulation , the Lisbon Agenda and open accountability and control of our budgets . #% Who , therefore , decides what qualifies for it ? #% In fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good . #% In my opinion , to create two separate regulations simply does not make sense and would undermine the efforts that we are making to streamline and clarify our programmes . #% However , given that this measure increases protection given to the consumer and provides an incentive for airlines to improve their performance in respect of the services they provide to their customers , Conservative MEPs felt that this was a compelling reason , despite the reservations outlined above , to support the measure . #% Farmers need a clear direction as to where they are going . #% I am a lifelong keen sea angler , as are most of my family . #% The final point I want to make is about speed . #% We agree that legal aid should cover both pre-litigation advice and representation in court . #% They are not fishing in European Union waters : they fish exclusively outside European Union waters , under agreements which we have negotiated with various countries around the world , and those agreements are I hope respected and monitored . #% For example , both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Legal Affairs took the view that requiring every segment of the fleet to have reached its objectives before any segment could benefit from financial assistance ran counter to the principles of natural justice . #% It can be compared to rearranging buckets under the tap to stop a flood without considering the possibility of at least turning down the tap a little to reduce the flow of water . #% There is a need for better dialogue between richer and poorer countries . #% Nothing that the Commissioner has offered addresses the fundamental flaw and that is that it is a common policy . #% With what targets are we to start ? #% We will be voting that position . #% There is unnecessary regulation and , speaking as a pro-European , I think it does us more harm than good . #% We can have the trialogue in Athens and try again . #% I can assure you that this side of the House will work with you to get the measure through , because it is the most important measure for the internal market since the 1992 programme and it is crucial for jobs and employment . #% However , there are several areas that still need improvement . #% With some reservations , I welcome the Article 82 consultation , which draws on recent experience , but it seems to me that there should also be more consultation with regard to Commission procedures and Regulation ( EC ) No 773/2004 . #% They were linked , of course , and everyone here knows how difficult it was for some to give up 3.5 % of the EU 's overall agricultural support . #% If Mr Papayannakis wants to express a personal opinion , he should have the freedom to do so . #% 
That is for our Bureau to decide and we would like to have clarity on that issue . #% In Britain , Ireland and elsewhere we have not gone down the route of some of our fellow Member States , which is to take the recommended minimum daily allowance that was set by the American Government in 1943 to ensure that GIs serving in Europe did not suffer from scurvy and beri beri , and to treat that as the basis for maximum intake before classification as a pharmaceutical . #% I agree with the Commissioner that resources should therefore be focused on them . #% Nevertheless we should welcome the fact that we have a joint debate of this nature taking place , and together with the debates we shall have on blood safety and on tobacco advertising over the next two plenary sessions , it will raise the profile of the European Union health portfolio quite considerably . #% Parliament , in its first reading , recommended a Type II ( b ) committee . #% Indeed , Commissioner Cresson was obliged to reply to the debate while Members were still coming into vote . #% Furthermore , the UK stands completely by the conclusion reached in Council that in no circumstances may telecommunications interceptions be used to gain commercial advantage . #% I would just like to suggest to Mr Martinez that last year over 20 people died from listeria in France - more people than caught BSE . #% Private enterprise in Belarus can not function efficiently , and the effects of the Chernobyl disaster are still of grave concern . #% And therefore , maybe an informal document such as this would be useful for Seattle . #% To date , we have contributed some GBP 180 billion . #% Kofi Annan also wants non-African states to supply more troops , and Canada has been one of the first to agree . #% I strongly believe that taxation is a matter that should remain within the remit of the Member States . #% Having common standards for these cross-border payments , credit transfers and direct debits is an important part of the health and growth of the single market . #% on Amendment No 174 from the PPE Group #% Mr President , last year I was the rapporteur on the 1996 annual economic report and I am very conscious of the difficulties under which both the Commission and the rapporteur have had to work . #% The report also places liability for vaccines with manufacturers , which may hinder the supply of vaccines and blurs lines of accountability . #% For this reason Labour MEPs supported the amendments that would exclude Western Sahara from the scope of the agreement and voted against the agreement when the exclusion amendments fell . #% I can find something far better to do on a Friday than sit there facing the Council . #% The crisis has gravely undermined Europe 's global competitiveness and weakened its political influence . #% That has made it impossible for me to endorse the Member States ' nominations . #% The same situation in ` euroland ' could happen if we develop free trade with North America . #% Recently in the Czech Republic there was restructuring in the banking sector . #% This is mainly because , these days , the Lib-Lab-Con sit at Westminster and like to be told what to do , having given away control to the EU . #% If the Commission is going to come forward with new plans -- as it should -- then it should do so before Parliament rises in June to give us time to scrutinise them properly . #% Madam President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this important report . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the TRIPS amendment is both overdue and ahead of its time . #% The most despicable and stupid proposal is the denial of development aid to countries which fail to stem migration , thereby making them even poorer and generating a new exodus of desperate people . #% It is because of the unsustainable fishing practices of decades . #% It is not really a bad result . #% It is important for both countries to continue to consolidate the ongoing reform of their justice systems , enhancing transparency , efficiency and the impartiality of their judiciary . #% On voting rights , on the selection of ethnic minority candidates , what I do not understand is whether they have no institutional memory or whether , a more sinister development , their political position has changed . #% All the petitioners have their normal residence -- i.e. , the place where they live at least 185 days in each calendar year , because of personal or occupational ties -- in a Member State other than Greece ; that is , they fulfil the conditions laid down in the directive . #% Mr President , I welcome this directive and Mr Nisticò 's elegant improvement of its direction . #% Madam President , the McKenna report assesses the first of a very important series of reports by the Commission on the effectiveness of the common fisheries policy in the area of monitoring . #% Last month five Tibetan monks were arrested in Drepung Monastery . #% We must put some teeth into our common foreign and security policy . #% In the light of the Commission 's options as presented , we , like the rapporteur , take the view that the list should not be further extended at this stage . #% I fail to see how you can have legislation aimed at preventing the sale of illegally logged timber which does not actually make doing so an offence . #% I wish to urge most strongly that the WTO collaborate in full with the International Labour Organization to ensure that core labour standards are observed as was recommended in the final declaration of the 1996 Singapore Summit . #% I am grateful both to the former Italian presidency and the current Irish presidency for the work we have been able to do together . #% Tonight we are pleased to be able to offer our full support to the rapporteur , Mr Stenmarck , who has , as ever , worked on this proposal for a directive with great skill and has steered the proposal through the committee with great speed . #% Why were Parliament 's hearings a success ? #% I understand his concern but I have the advantage of going to the General Affairs Council and having our proposals - I quote `` warmly welcomed '' and also having an extremely good reception in ECOFIN at lunch where the discussion was naturally quite intimate but immensely constructive . #% The economic advantages of doing this pale into insignificance compared with the devastation that has been the direct result of this risky practice . #% These statements are widely reported in the press . #% Finally , I thank the rapporteur for the commitment he has shown in drafting a highly appropriate report , and I look forward to a positive response from the Commission . #% That is why Pascal Lamy told a forum of African ministers last week that this is what is at stake and this is why we have to bid on what is on the table although it is not sufficient . #% The Ethiopian Government 's decision to move back its forces has been very welcome . #% The first is to support the Commission as far as possible in its effort to keep it simple and not to include unnecessary complications such as biometric risk . #% A European equivalent would be a bureaucratic behemoth , unable to keep up with the dynamism and innovation of financial markets . #% However , I do think that if the European Commission actually withdraws its case on HelmsBurton , having satisfied European interests , then it would be undermining the WTO itself . #% More clearly needs to be done . #% We should be no under illusions , however : the method by which these summits are organised is now in crisis . #% The majority recommendation of the committee now is to approve all the candidates , with which I personally agree . #% As Miller said in his speech , these arrangements should be drawn up and adopted at the earliest possible opportunity . #% That will , everybody anticipates , involve a year of negotiations on the detail of amendments to the Staff Regulations and the pay and pensions package , which will take nearly the whole of 2002 . #% The European Union should assist this reform process by supporting financially and also technically certainly carefully selected confidence-building measures , without which the fasting will not cease . #% Each Member State should have a comprehensive universal postal service at an affordable uniform tariff . #% We have seen what has happened in relation to Kyoto ; we saw the attempt to sabotage the UN Conference on the proliferation of small arms and we now see the Farm Bill , which threatens to exceed the limits set out in the WTO in terms of subsidies for farmers . #% I suppose it is still possible in theory that the Council will agree with Parliament 's figures , or even go higher . #% The Tribunal must leave a sound legacy , both as a model for other potential ad hoc tribunals and in order to contribute to the strengthening of justice in the Balkan countries . #% The British Conservatives introduced in Great Britain a similar law in 1988 . #% Seeing so many friendly and familiar faces here this evening , however , I am also reminded that we perhaps make up in sheer intelligence and talent for the lack of numbers that we are able to muster this evening , merry gang of telecoms specialists that we are . #% Property values #% ` Jobs R Us ' might be the leitmotif of this debate . #% 
However , I should emphasise that I do not think that is any reflection on her . #% It is a question of the power of the regulatory body to authorise start-up procedures to ensure stoppage for maintenance and to be the final arbiter for loading and restarting . #% Mr President , I should like to start by saying that 15 minutes ago there were still no amendments in English to two of the reports despite your assurances at 9 o'clock that there would be some within a couple of minutes . #% It is not a forgettable minority . #% I do not need to remind the Commissioner -- although he may wish to refer to it -- that the Council 's record to date in dealing with these issues has , frankly , been deplorable . #% It lifts sanctions : how many people in this Chamber have been calling for that over the last few years ? #% I would therefore like the new Commission - and I ask Commissioner Kinnock now - to make an overall evaluation of the efficiency of the TACIS programme and then to report back on how they will improve the programme for the year 2000 budget so we can have greater confidence when we vote in support of the TACIS programme . #% The Conservatives are opposed to the return of any of the former Commission and we have been denied votes on individual Commissioners . #% Honourable Members repeatedly have drawn attention to those realities in this debate and indeed on many other occasions . #% In the new millennium , with new global problems requiring new global solutions , they need to give good arguments why it can not be done now , rather than why it has not been done in the past . #% These include parts of Europe that are not even part of the EU : the southern part of Norway is in one such region ; northern Norway and Iceland is another . #% You will be entitled to the very generous daily allowance ; you will find the chauffeur service at your disposal ; there will be an endless round of breakfasts , lunches , dinners and drinks receptions . #% Thank you , President-in-Office , for that supplementary reply . #% This is unlikely to change , but a small but important industry can be helped and aided . #% In some areas we lay down detailed legislation - which the Member States have to comply with . #% We have heard much about ex-presidents , the Pope , academics ; they all have one thing in common , they are totally powerless . #% Could you try to get something sorted out so that we can restrict access to main lifts during voting sessions to Members only ? #% I went to Gabon and South Africa and met doctors who are desperate to use those drugs , who have read the Internet press releases saying that the prices have been brought down ; yet when they ring up they can not actually acquire the drugs to treat those patients . #% We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation . #% Sign the Rome Treaty on the ICC and thereby signal our commitment and our challenge to the rest of the world . #% Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Kallas , will these be like the EU 's own accounts , in which the directors-general of the Commission sign off their respective departments with reservations , because they have not got a clue where the money has gone ? #% It is a definition , which is inevitably a compromise , of what cooperative enterprise is about , to which the cooperative movement itself across Europe has agreed . #% That has been stated here in the House many times by her and I appreciate it greatly . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - The unfolding and tragic events at the Red Mosque in Islamabad show that Pakistan faces a clear and present threat from extremist ideology . #% Mr President , I just wish to point out that Question Time is supposed to last an hour and a half . #% Tourism is a key sector in Europe , and the euro will definitely provide a huge degree of additional transparency . #% Let us not forget that in spite of the great leaps forward that South Africa has taken , the life of many South Africans is still one of extreme poverty without work or land or a decent home . #% Its effect will be to create massive quantities of materials in a highly volatile market . #% Like Mr Posselt I agree that human rights are very important . #% One thing we found out was that the US , Australia and New Zealand still do not have foot and mouth and they control their imports wholly . #% The unemployment rate is high and rising and 101 000 regulations and directives are bleeding the life out of the wealth creators . #% At that meeting we discussed the possibility of his playing a role in some form of mediation in Afghanistan leading to the restoration of the democracy which he established in 1964 , and which involved free media , free elections and the involvement of women in politics - a very far cry from the current state of affairs in Afghanistan . #% In the past even under Delors and under Jacques Santer it never appeared that way , but the second stage is vital . #% Would Mr Watson like to tell us whether he deliberately misled the House , or is this just another example of British Liberal Democrats ' inability to call failing Commissioners to account ? #% Is all that spectrum within the remit of the working party or is it really within a new common fisheries policy as a common fisheries policy ? #% Montreal was a success , but only in relative terms . #% Even the ILO itself has stated that Colombia is not in full compliance with ILO core labour standards , which should be necessary to afford GSP + benefits . #% The report warns that a lack of progress ` will have serious implications for the negotiation process and could even bring it to a halt ' . #% Not content with single legal frameworks , tax harmonisation and the rest , the EU apparently wants to control nature . #% One has to look at the charges brought against these individuals . #% The House is aware of the renewed detention of some leaders and members of the unrecognised Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam . #% Big ideas can fail , Mr President , and I really worry about this European project . #% In a few years ' time , following the enlargement of the European Union , they will have access to a potential 500m customers - as big as the American and Japanese markets put together . #% Have they been throwing their weight around the WTO trying to bully the emerging democracies into submission ? #% Whatever its content they are happy to call this product chocolate . #% Those tensions will continue and only get worse , because it really is impossible to run a single economic policy which suits every single one of those 12 economies . #% Patent holders must allow the production of generic alternatives in poorer countries . #% Mr President , it has been a long hard road on this directive . #% We should avoid disconnection wherever possible in favour of other , more effective measures to combat piracy . #% Of the twelve tests required for cosmetics , three have alternatives now , a fourth is in the pipeline , four more have been refined or reduced , four have no alternatives even on the horizon . #% However , I think there is a contradiction in the PPE-DE Group 's position - one I know the PPE-DE Group has debated internally - and there is a contradiction in this report . #% Amendments 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 concern in different ways the added value the Agency should bring to the data it collects and collates through analysis , evaluation , identification of best practice and dissemination of that information and best practice to where it is most needed , particularly with small and medium-sized enterprises . #% Mr President , may I begin by stating how bizarre it is that we are debating the extension of a regulation tonight in May 2000 that already expired last December and which , under the Commission ' s proposal , would again expire in seven months ' time . #% We will look back in amazement at how much more progress Europe made on cutting red tape on goods and businesses than it did on people . #% Changes are going to have to take place to meet the requirements of this proposal . #% Mr President , like everyone else , I welcome this report . #% However , there are questions to which we demand answers . #% In June , I warned the House that there was often a yawning gap between the Prime Minister 's rhetoric and reality . #% The CAP is an artificial , expensive and unnecessary burden on farmers and consumers . #% And on an occasion like this the Commission is not necessarily the enemy - in fact it is quite a friend . #% Even though this directive delivers a balanced view , taking into account the various factors affecting Member States , it is clear that the cross-border approach to supplementary pensions needs more in the way of liberalising articles . #% It is clearly not . #% The tremendous poverty of the Palestinians has to be alleviated and we should be looking to encourage projects of economic cooperation which link the Palestinians with the Israelis in order , in the long term , to cement the peace process . #% It is not available for television companies to use and it is not available for archives . #% Mr President , in Mr Christodoulou 's report - in the explanatory statement - there is a wonderful line that says this ` provides a long-term solution , since it has not been unilaterally denounced by any of the three institutions concerned ' - yet . #% But what happens if Parliament objects and then the Commission does not accept its objection to an implementing measure ? #% 
By joining forces with Germany in the way it did , France has alienated America , undermined the UN , sent the wrong signals - signals of division - to Baghdad and exposed the impossibility of ever achieving a single foreign and security policy . #% Surely we should be able to manage our affairs efficiently . #% What we really need is for the Commission , as the independent arbiter , to be able to find mechanisms to put pressure on Member States which are so reluctant to rock the boat within the Council and to point the finger at one another . #% The very existence of this debate shows that in the European Parliament , and indeed with the Commission and the Council , we have been pushing for more attention to be paid to the role of Europe in education . #% This is a debate about how to further an illegitimate United States of Europe . #% Finally , we must not become complacent . #% I hope you will accept that as a genuine mistake , and the record can be amended accordingly . #% I can not say definitively that we know how scrapie originated in sheep . #% I am delighted to report that the ECB has so far agreed three of them , and we must give them credit for this . #% Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heaven ' s sake . #% Indeed , its charter suggests it is committed to global Jihad , including using suicide bombers and establishing a theocracy and an Islamic caliphate everywhere . #% I wish them well in the presidency . #% The Colombian President has committed his government to taking decisive action against these illegal paramilitary forces . #% Can I say to the President-in-Office that I welcome as a good first step the code of conduct for the arms trade which is designed to prevent arms being used for either internal repression or external aggression . #% It wants to take over relations with Eurocontrol from Member States , bringing it closer to achieving its ambition to be what Monnet described as a European government . #% Can you give us some idea whether there will be any across-the-board reductions ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , the ECR Group accepts that Russia is a vital economic partner and a global diplomatic heavyweight , but this position brings with it responsibilities . #% We can not ignore China with its annual 11 % growth rates , but we must also not shy away from criticising this very great country when it is appropriate . #% And again we recognise the importance of solidarity in that first pillar , not least for those whose working lives are involved with more casual labour , short-term contracts and so on . #% How will we be protecting , ensuring and supporting the Rwandan Government 's case for beginning those trials in January ? #% And in the south of Iraq , he has drained the historic Iraqi marshlands . #% To be quite honest , if the Russians are not prepared to invest in Russia what chance is there that anybody else will do so ? #% But most important - and here I address the Secretary-General of Parliament - is the letter which the president of my group sent to the President of Parliament yesterday about the absolute need to have a multi-annual plan for enlargement before the first reading of Parliament 's budget so that we can get a grip on what is likely to come in terms of expenditure in linguistic services and a whole range of other matters . #% That was the first point we made when we looked at the APS back in May . #% Ask yourself a question : would you buy a used car from this Commission ? #% He had all the information and for understandable reasons he kept it to himself . #% One reason for this rise is that employment opportunities are fewer these days , so people look towards starting their own work . #% I was privileged to be there as part of a small group of colleagues from Parliament . #% Colombia is another case of blatant violation of workers ' rights , despite the window dressing of official enshrinement of ILO conventions . #% The impression is left that we are foot-dragging , but in fact we are not getting complete answers to the questions put by Mr Bösch and Mr Blak . #% Did the United Kingdom between 1978 and 2001 implement fully and correctly Directive 73/239/EEC ? #% Today we have effectively given the big companies a licence to print money . #% Mr President , as someone who has consistently called in this House for an early report from the presidency on the progress of our own staff reforms , can I be the first to welcome the fact that we received a letter from the President yesterday on this subject . #% So , with our compromises and our amendments , we go for prioritisation , pre-registration , ` one substance , one registration ' , data sharing , a balance between volume and risk , special account of the needs of small firms without sacrificing public safety , and mandatory data sharing to reduce and phase out animal testing . #% Again , I gather that there are some detainees who are in desperate need of such attention . #% On the issue of labelling , I am sorry to see that there are amendments against this . #% We must , however , strive to see that out of this trauma comes something of a catharsis , so that civil society is reinforced by its great efforts to cope with the aftermath of the earthquake crisis . #% We all know the EU has very limited responsibilities as regards education , but there are some places where the European Union can give added value . #% We must also look at the issue of codification of the Treaties . #% Criminal money could give liberalisation a bad name . #% Mr President , I should like to say , on my own behalf and on behalf of Mr Titley , that response is rather weak . #% This will insert the word `` not '' , so that the last phrase reads as follows : `` independent from other activities not relating to the transmission system '' . #% If you look tonight at the amendments which the Socialists will be supporting , we have relatively long timescales for these new regulations to be incorporated into EU law . #% But there is a difference between the noble Nordic hunter scaling the utmost peak in pursuit of an individual elk , the picture that Mr Sjöstedt would commend to us , and the syndicates of flabby businessmen turning out on English landed estates , as they turn in a large quota of inexpertly shot birds and animals for the market . #% Let me ask all comrades and colleagues around this room today to consider the effects of the amendments that could be passed this week , the damage they could cause , the lack of confidence that would surely emerge and the damage it would do to this nascent market . #% I have always been fascinated by the work of the European Court of Justice . #% The precise status of the New China News Agency should be clarified as a matter of priority . #% In doing so , we recognised that the proposals were far from perfect but they did at least attempt to address the present situation . #% Why do they think that ? #% This will not only facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance , but of course it will also help the whole process of building a long-term solution in Rwanda and elsewhere . #% We have a fine opportunity now to make a strong case for long-term multilateral development . #% Sadly , this is another own goal by the Commission . #% Better infrastructure , efficiently functioning public administration supporting democratic structures and the continued transition to a market economy are vital to achieve this . #% No , it did not ! #% Who is to say that when we have 20-something states around the table that sometime some government or another will not be tempted to use a similar tactic ? #% In the past the Union has been rightly criticised for being slow in responding to crises . #% Excluding Parliament , special circumstances decided by an unelected body , secretive motives : all are the beginnings of totalitarianism . #% If the conference is held in Thailand , it is very important for both this Parliament and the Commission to raise these issues with the Thai Government . #% Far too often our relationship is characterized by misunderstandings and confusions . #% As a Brit , I can say that , on the issue of own resources , I understand why it is doing this . #% There have also been many specific human rights issues and concerns which have been taken up over the past six months . #% Mr President , the Minutes of 29 May show a considerably larger attendance than we get on the last day of a Strasbourg session . #% Mr President , I would like to thank , on behalf of my Group , Mr Quinn , the President-in-Office , for the full and comprehensive way in which he set out the Council 's reactions to the broad economic guidelines . #% If we are to have a stronger motor , we will also occasionally need stronger brakes -- perhaps an emergency brake -- and better safety features too , such as a safety belt on each seat . #% By 2009 the battery cage system of egg production will be no more . #% Mr President , this Parliament has often discussed the issue of trade union rights in Colombia , but on behalf of myself and my colleague , Mr De Rossa , I ask you to intervene urgently in the defence of workers from the trade union Sintracarbon . #% 
This is a very sad day for Parliament and for the rule of law . #% Diseases like Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's , diabetes , heart disease and even cancer have yet to be fully challenged by the biotechnologists . #% Now I realise that the Commission might be sensitive about doing so , in case it brings the wrath of this House down on it . #% We can only do this if Member States work together , if we copy good practice from one country to another , if we do not repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past . #% I hope that report will include the proposals for two new conference rooms here . #% It is important not just for the safety of the environment but in particular for human health and safety . #% The time has come to develop a true European perspective for our railway network , and the first step for that development is the first railway package . #% With regard to regional policy , my group would like to see the Commission ensure the full application of the partnership principle at all levels of programming of the Structural Funds . #% Although perhaps unfeasible , it enjoys enormous support , and I find the resistance of the Council and the Commission to discussion of this tax staggering . #% Likewise the necessity for training of police officers and others in authority . #% Conflict resolution should be at the centre of the Cypriot accession and the Union should prove itself far more creative , and even ingenious , than it has been so far . #% The objectives on the environment and social policy are , in many cases , not being delivered and yet we have the costs and inconsistencies that go with them . #% On the contrary , I would regard it as a great benefit and advantage of the report that it is a very sensible compromise between two desires , two considerations , one of which is to have a wide range of opinion and expertise working in the subcommittees , while the other is to have a clear line of responsibility between the subcommittees and their principal committees . #% Hopefully , in November we will get something a lot more concrete . #% As colleagues know , democracy is my watchword . #% Name one NGO which supports that position . #% The cooperation that exists already between Parliament and industry has been impressive . #% The problem is that unless we have some democratic scrutiny , in a post-election system where we may see deterioration of the situation in the DRC , there is a danger of mission creep and being sucked into a quagmire . #% The Commission is in a position to determine an order of priority for proceedings by reference to , firstly , the perceived damage to the Community legal order , secondly the perceived damage to the interest protected by the rule that has been breached , thirdly the recurrent nature of certain infringements which are the subject of individual or collective complaints and fourthly the harm caused to Community 's financial interests . #% From the information and evidence collected for the committee , it all seems very convenient that so many people carrying out the checks and balances of the company came very late to the party : i.e. , the present board of management took over in 2000 after the company had all but ceased taking on new business ; the Financial Services Authority was not created until late 1999 , so it is not responsible for what happened before it came into existence ; the financial actuaries advising the UK Government before the FSA was formed maintain that Equitable Life was always solvent , although one actuary giving evidence to our inquiry did admit there are up to six ways of valuing an insurance company . #% At the beginning of the year the British presidency stressed that things have to change . #% My group welcomes the progress made by a number of companies to examine and audit their progress and to make that information public , whether it is information , for example , on their environmental impact , the effectiveness of their equal opportunities policy , or their involvement in the local community . #% Epidemics start that way , so it was with foot and mouth disease . #% In some cases their figures are achievable , in others not . #% Under the previous regime we also saw a growing abuse of human rights , of people such as the Sindhi . #% We are not faced with an issue of overwhelming rejection or of overwhelming acceptance , but we are facing a problem of divergence . #% Firstly , how important is the New Delhi Conference ? #% They are values that Christians , non-Christians , people of other religions and of no religion share . #% It is by encouraging public sector broadcasters , helping European film production that we can get better quality programmes , not by quotas . #% And how would you prove liability ? #% Mr President , these reports state the wish of the majority in this Parliament to see Bulgaria and Romania join the European Union by 1 January 2007 . #% Finally , the call for more Internet use in the information campaign will ensure that this campaign is not only cost-effective but environmentally sound , too . #% It really is unfortunate that the Parliament is behaving in this manner . #% This would further expand the scope of the directive and would bring benefits to more service sector workers . #% Without stronger leadership from the EU , there can and will be no final agreement . #% Nevertheless , on pragmatic grounds , I accept the need for cordial trading and diplomatic relations between the EU and Libya under a framework agreement . #% The way to ensure maximum employment for those people , both men and women , who want to work , is to get off the backs of businesses and deregulate . #% Mrs Lynne says that people with severe learning difficulties can not represent themselves . #% Takeovers will not be made any easier but , nevertheless , the PSE Group wanted a form of words to provide some political concession , as if they were being made easier . #% Mr President , since there is a very large measure of agreement in this House over the fundamentals of policy towards the ECB , I would like to address one specific measure which we have in the draft resolution , which we have requested before without receiving a formal response from the Governing Council in the Annual Report , and I hope this will be rectified . #% Those who lie down with dogs get fleas . #% Mr President , on behalf of the British Conservatives , I should like to offer our strong support to the Spanish authorities in their fight against terrorism . #% Mr President , Rule 166 states very clearly that you are required to give us a response to complaints such as those already made by my colleagues , Mr Batten and Mr Knapman , concerning violence used against our members of staff by your members of staff . #% I would therefore ask you either to confirm this categorically or , if not , to confirm that measures are taken to investigate the situation . #% This requires effective administrative and medical systems , including diagnostic systems , in each Member State . #% The jury is still out regarding GM crops and , given the irreversible nature of these decisions , there is no sound basis for making claims that biotechnology will be the answer to all our problems . #% As I know that colleagues in other groups had exactly the same problem with this word , I would suggest to friends and colleagues that it might be appropriate not to accept the compromise amendment but to vote instead in favour of both Amendments Nos 100 and 101 , which are compatible , and that would achieve precisely the result desired by many people . #% The debate which has begun between Member States is reflected in the points of view expressed within the European Parliament , as is the tension over the scope of the IGC . #% If there is another war across that border , I believe it could turn into a nuclear war , and that will be a problem not only for India and Pakistan and the people of Kashmir but for all of us . #% If the circumstances arose and then the President of the Commission did not use that power we could then censure the Commission as a whole . #% There are such regimes in Norway and New Zealand that actually outlaw discarding which , although it still goes on , is probably thereby reduced from some 40 % , as Mr Adam mentioned , down to more like 20 % . #% An estimated 45 000 troops have been sent into the province against 5000 rebels . #% This is the main reason why we can not accept this report . #% Their learning situation is terrible . #% I would like to focus quickly on 111 and 112 , the two amendments which the rapporteur appeared to endorse in her opening speech , which deal with the application of the universal standards through the groundwater directive . #% The second point is : I understand that many Members of this Parliament , including myself , are under pressure from non-governmental organisations to postpone this . #% By ignoring my simple request and by maintaining that these free holidays do not constitute a conflict of interests , Mr Barroso has put himself in an unenviable position . #% In 1998 , a report by the Working Group on Eco-System Effects of Fishing Activities of the International Council for Exploration of the Seas identified for the first time that sea birds , specifically the kittiwake , which has been experiencing low breeding success over recent years , were in fact in competition with the industrial fleet , primarily Danish operators fishing for sand eels off the East coast of Scotland and England . #% Secondly , the people in question , led by Dr Rath from Germany , have practised deception on Parliament . #% There are many aspects of the Lucas report with which I do not agree . #% In reality , that form of words in their amendments merely echoes what is already in the information and consultation directive . #% Bangladesh also protests at India 's understandable attempts to fence off the porous international border which is subject to contraband , including illegal drug smuggling . #% We need to ask which consumers will benefit from the Soviet economics of price caps . #% Quite often it is a price paid to criminal gangs , there to exploit the motivation of these people . #% Mr President , given the time constraints and also the feeling in my group that the ECB has essentially been doing a good job in difficult circumstances , I would like to concentrate on some remaining structural issues concerning communications and accountability . #% Different industries face different threats necessitating different security measures . #% 
We need to be absolutely clear where they are coming from . #% Mr President , without referring to any particular person , can I point out that there is a ruling by the Quaestors confirmed by the Bureau , that mobile phones should not be used in the Chamber . #% I call upon the new Commission to cease to vilify the Greek Cypriot people post-referendum . #% We did this , not because we support the contents of Parliament 's report , but because it is imperative that Parliament gives an opinion so that Council may proceed to a decision . #% I think we will come to see in the future that all roads did lead to Lisbon via Luxembourg , Cardiff and Cologne , because Lisbon should be the end of a process , one that can actually deliver as regards the sort of priorities we want to bring to a successful conclusion throughout the whole of the European Union . #% However , we also believe , firstly , that Parliament 's Petitions Committee , as the ` eyes and ears ' of the institutions , should highlight any systematic problems affecting the free movement of thousands of our citizens which are brought to light by the petitions process . #% The Habitats Directive , from which Natura 2000 derives , seeks to establish a common framework for nature protection as though wildlife were subject to academic theory . #% That is why the capability process currently under way is so important . #% We were told that all subjects were open to start with , but the subject of reform of the acquis has been closed . #% It is not acceptable that this situation is unresolved , given the importance of Russia 's relations with the European Union . #% The Council has been working through those proposals since 1999 and Parliament has followed the workings with a view to cooperation where there is progress for people and where it aligns with ECJ rulings . #% It would dramatise political attention if we were to indicate exactly why this is so politically difficult . #% The key issue will be the interaction between the two centres of decision making , NATO and the EU , and the impact of this on the transatlantic relationship . #% We must never neglect the historic environment in all our countries . #% There has to be change in how railways work , both in the passenger and freight sectors . #% We should consider that lesson when we try to impose peace agreements in the future . #% Now is the time to bring that investment up to an entirely new level for the future . #% Mr President , this debate deals with the harrowing and distressing circumstances of tug-of-love , transnationally abducted children of separated parents living in different countries . #% A case would not necessarily be brought if only one region were interested , but if several regions felt there was a real violation of their rights , then the Committee of the Regions would proceed and bring a case . #% Instead of handcuffs he gets champagne in Brussels and Paris . #% New gas-fired plants have already contributed to the UK meeting its targets . #% There have been instances in the past where we could have been accused of complicity with forced return : it is absolutely illegal in international law and the Commission must be vigilant on that . #% I am registered as voting against that amendment when , in fact , I wanted to vote in favour . #% I wholeheartedly support the report by my Socialist colleague which calls for new measures to tackle road deaths and promote road safety in Europe . #% So please , support this today . #% It has been a long , hard battle . #% Mr President , I have to acknowledge that , as Mr Cashman has said , even in my own constituency of London we continue to see prejudice and homophobic crime . #% The common position is already a compromise and takes account of first reading amendments by adding in measures on existing plants which were not part of the Commission proposal . #% It is complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech while China simply does the manufacturing . #% I have to say though that I do not share Mrs Beckett 's upbeat assessment of how the European Union is doing , despite the British Government 's pledge to make climate change a priority for its Presidency . #% That is how we interpret it and I think there can be no other interpretation . #% Finally , I have to ask whether the EU is serious about state-building in the Horn of Africa or whether we are actually focusing on other priorities . #% I also took the opportunity to register my disapproval of the way the Commission has deliberately ignored the will of this House with regard to aid for hospitals in Belarus , which are woefully ill-equipped to treat the cancers -- particularly in children -- which have occurred as a direct result of the Chernobyl disaster . #% New technologies , such as embryo stem cell research , can not be ruled out as sources of future therapies for either medical or ethical reasons . #% However , they naturally expect those products to be organic , not to be produced with chemicals or chemical fertilisers . #% It is simply disingenuous to say , as the Commission has , that the classification of documents as confidential has no link with public access to such documents . #% When we talk about disability , we must remember that we are talking about all forms of disability : people with mobility problems , hearing impairments , visual impairments , mental health problems , learning disabilities , chronic illnesses and other , hidden , disabilities . #% For example , EU citizenship is impossible to renounce . #% What we are always trying to do in these sort of situations is improve the way that the systems work and get things to work better . #% The whole thing was an outrage . #% But my group believes that , with the Eurosceptics of the Right objecting to any cooperation in this field , we have to say that those of us who are not on the Right , who care about civil liberties , should agree to these measures but then put pressure on the Commission and the Council to have these citizens ' safeguards . #% Mr President , Mr President-in-Office -- Home Secretary -- I would like to add my welcome to you and my recognition of the enormously difficult challenges you face . #% I wonder what Muslims in Britain and across Europe think when the British Conservatives say that troops from Muslim countries can not be relied upon to do their job in a United Nations force ? #% Does the Commissioner agree that in looking at which regions will qualify under the 75 % rule for objective 1 funding after 1999 , it would be inappropriate to apply this rule in a rigid , statistical way given that some regions will fall just above or just below the 75 % according to some , frankly , not very reliable statistics . #% I believe it is slightly too late to ask for a split vote . #% I do not believe that employees in those plants would be courageous enough and willing to report these practices to authority . #% Finally , we have had a long saga about the European company statute tonight : we celebrate the movement towards the end of the long saga about cooperatives . #% I wish to say , therefore , that the success of the Barcelona process is not just important to the south of Europe , but to all of Europe . #% This is a subject which I know he is very capable to deal with , since I have participated in a number of seminars organised by his services . #% At the top there is a small village where you can buy food , water and `` souvenirs '' . #% Similarly Mr Tung told me in conversation that he does not want to see foreign interference in Hong Kong political activity . #% I do not know if it was a malfunction of my fingers or a malfunction of the machine but I intended to vote against it . #% I must confirm what Mrs Kinnock said about the poorest people not receiving the funding . #% I hope that in the same way the measures before the House today will encourage not just completely organic stockrearing but also generally-improved animal husbandry by non-organic farmers , in particular in the raising of chickens and calves , in line with consumer demand . #% We must be clear that there should be no interference with the ability of the inspectors to go in . #% Paragraph 22 of this report calls for the establishment of a European sustainable energy agency . #% It ought , like the watchdog committees in the US Congress , to have the power to commission its own inquiries and then to bring in the Court of Auditors or UCLAF as appropriate . #% Mr President , Burma , since the sixties , has isolated itself from the world at large , at great cost to its own people . #% No income means no medicine ; no transport means no school ; no health certificate means no work ; no access means no opportunity to prove one 's worth . #% It is important to success to be able to finish the race . #% My concern is twofold : firstly , as regards what will America do with those it does not file charges against who , if returned to their own countries of origin , may face torture and death for reasons of unrelated Islamic militancy ; and secondly , with regard to paragraph 5 of the resolution , which suggests a role for the international criminal court , which has yet to get off the ground ? #% Hard cases make bad law , and at present it is even difficult to reconcile the proposals in the consultation document -- such as paragraphs 238 , 239 and 240 -- both with themselves and with the apparent demands on Microsoft . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , who is nearly at the end of the second reading . #% Common sense may eventually prevail . #% Enlargement could make or break the European Union . #% No wonder , Sir , you look so happy this morning . #% 
The joint supervisory authority responsible for data protection is composed of a Member from each Member State . #% In its resolution on the green paper , Parliament asked for a policy that would strike a balance between the needs of environmental sustainability and of fisheries as a socio-economic sector . #% Firstly , it is because these committees of national civil servants - and only these committees - have the right to block the Commission implementing measure and refer it back to the legislature or part of the legislature . #% What if the automobile industry subsequently does not apply the deal , because it is not enshrined in legislation ? #% Maybe dialogue between transatlantic legislators can help in this area . #% I want to remind him - and he cautiously skirted around this in his answer - that we are discussing an archaic piece of legislation . #% If they do go off the market they may , as we have heard , go abroad , go offshore or appear on the Internet , at some risk to the consumer . #% in writing . - The signing of the Reform Treaty was the highlight of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council , and the news that the Hungarian Parliament has already ratified it ( despite not yet having the benefit of the European Parliament 's views on it , as we will vote in February ) is welcome . #% It needs to be sure of accurate , fast , comparable data and that there are no weak links in the chain . #% Without the resources , we can not serve our citizens . #% We have a wide-ranging agenda and , whatever lists we may wish to make , all our work relates to the Cotonou Partnership Agreement , which is a binding , contractual agreement between Europe and the ACP member states . #% Mr President , today in Europe and every part of the civilised world it is Thursday , but in Turkmenistan ironically it is ` the day of justice ' . #% It is likely that cases may occur due to maternal transmission but these will be isolated and not feed-related , and there is no justification for a return to cohort culling . #% However , even my limited experience has taught me to be cynical . #% We stress the need for an effective means of arms control and an effective disarmament programme to be put in place . #% As an elected Member for all citizens in my constituency I take great exception to being considered part of the bikers ' lobby . #% We also face a massive humanitarian catastrophe , as the hard-line Sudanese junta absolutely refuses to accept the UN troops , as agreed by the Security Council last week in New York . #% It recognises that AIDS/HIV is the most serious challenge to humankind today ; that the United Nations has declared at least 7 billion is needed worldwide ; and that proposals amounting to 5 billion have already been tabled . #% We did not want to cause any disruption to the process and passage of the budget , but what we did -- and Mrs Gill will bear this out -- was to urge extreme caution for 2005 . #% It is equally true , given the question tabled by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , that Parliament needs to be fully involved in this process . #% Human trafficking involves force , violence , deceit and abuse of its victims and is totally unacceptable . #% It is about admitting countries to a political and economic system which has brought peace , stability and prosperity to countries which spent much of modern history trying to destroy each other . #% It is well known that the system is not delivered in a consistent way across Member States . #% Any exception to the country-of-origin approach , whether in the ISD or in the e-commerce directive , should be strictly interpreted , narrowly interpreted and should be eliminated as soon as possible . #% We might just as well have had a debate with an empty chair . #% The situation in Zimbabwe is getting worse , not better . #% The Kyoto 5 % targeted reduction by 2010 from 1990 levels may not go far enough . #% Do you really think we are that stupid ? #% Why are there no fire instructions ? #% But we do want a structure and process that give confidence and deliver the right outcome . #% However , knowing how enthusiastically this House embraces all or any legislation , no matter how insane or restrictive , perhaps I will not be sorry if the amendment is actually accepted because , given the amount of damage it will do , it will at least show Parliament and the European Union to be the mad legislative machine that it really is . #% We regret that we can not vote for either of the amendments . #% I still have before me a completely blank sheet . #% Mr President , first of all may I say that I have much sympathy with the remarks that have just been passed by Mr Harbour . #% So to then work with Spinelli was an immense honour and privilege . #% We remember the hypocrisy of the Commission and Member States in regard to the free trade agreement negotiations with South Africa . #% We are not even a reliable partner : we are not even ratifying the agreements like Europol protocols , which would allow cooperation with the FBI . #% Perhaps we should occupy our time with a standardisation of windscreen wipers or spirit bottles , or phasing out the oldest profession in the world , or some such nonsense . #% We still have great shortfalls in our crisis management capabilities . #% I am pleased that this report sets out plans for the future . #% I hope the Council and the Commission will support this because it will help to reform the common agricultural policy . #% The common fisheries policy is not working . #% We believe in the sovereignty of the democratic nation-state . #% There is so much other work to be done to create a single market in financial services and to really deliver those benefits that the Commission report talked about only a few days ago . #% As I say , tyre pressure monitoring systems are very important , because under-inflated tyres - much to my shame , the United Kingdom is one of the worst culprits for having under-inflated tyres - are a cause of accidents . #% The problem of youth unemployment is not only due to the economic crisis ; employers are looking for people with professional experience . #% Last year , therefore , when we undertook the same discussions , we had further and more intensive deliberations with both external relations Commissioners , Mr Patten and Mr Nielson , and agreed that a minimum of 35 % of EU external assistance would be focused on social infrastructure , and in particular on basic health and education . #% Mr President , I think you have covered the point I was going to raise but Mr Bourlanges is being deliberately , or otherwise , disingenuous in the point of order he has raised . #% On immigration we need much better management in the future . #% Articles 28 to 30 of the Treaty and Regulation 2679/98 guarantee the free movement of goods . #% In order to make this directive as effective as possible it is crucial that mutual recognition should also be extended - and this is important - to cases where licences have been suspended or withdrawn . #% The situation is very much more serious at the moment . #% I think one of the great strengths of the EU , and of the European Parliament , is that we all come together - now with 27 Member States - and are actually very different , in many ways : different backgrounds and cultures , and obviously different languages . #% All the party political groups should find their own champion , and the procedure provided for by the Convention could easily and simply be brought into early use by us all in June and July . #% The risks of infection following an accident are not insignificant . #% In particular , we believe it is right that the directive and regulation line up to provide as seamless as possible a regime for the protection of industrial design across the Union as a whole . #% We must also have a proper evaluation of the year in clear and simple language , and in accessible formats . #% However , the outbreak is not out of control , as the remarks by some people here might give the impression . #% Second , we take the view that guide prices should be fixed by reference to national ports rather than to representative ports simply because the latter idea is too lacking in specification . #% For the first time in conciliation in the social field we are seeing moves , particularly on the right and centre groupings of the House , to weaken significantly common positions established in the Social Affairs Council , and even , at times , to exclude significant sectors of activity from the legislation altogether . #% Presumably -- and he may know better than I -- these thieves have differing motives for their crimes . #% In order , therefore , to safeguard the Rules of this House and the Rules governing every Member , to ensure that Members have the rights they enjoy under these Rules , the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group , with the support , as was announced earlier , of the EPP Group , requested that to make sure we were in conformity with our Rules , Rule 112 on urgent procedure should be applied . #% I fear personally that nothing will change in Pakistan until that country develops an education and political system that truly supports the principles of religious freedom , tolerance and equality . #% We have no issue with the Pakistan people . #% We want to see the EU doing more , not less , to support America 's principled leadership in the fight against terrorism . #% Since the break-up of the Soviet Union , the South Caucasus countries have clearly been through a very difficult period and some of them are making better progress than others . #% 
Some fear the WTO , some fear globalisation , some fear the advance of growth , markets , technology and science . #% Mr President , may I first congratulate the Greek minister for taking up the Presidency . #% Lastly , I remain deeply sceptical of the need for an EU human rights agency within or outside our borders . #% This termination allegedly followed commercial threats by the People 's Republic of China to withdraw the Beijing 2008 Olympic TV broadcasting contracts . #% A few weeks later , we did the best that we could . #% This shows a remarkable sign of solidarity from the existing Member States towards a small candidate country . #% People in Britain expect France to comply with European law and they also expect the European Commission to act decisively to end the illegal ban on British beef . #% Well , I suppose in some ways , you may well need Mrs Lagarde because not only is Greece going bust , not only are we heading for the fourth bail-out , but as I have warned before in this Assembly , the validity of the European Central Bank itself will very shortly be called into question . #% This issue goes far beyond individual families and goes right to the heart of the Union 's respect for its own laws and treaties . #% In the EU we are still depressingly opaque and inaccessible . #% Nobody ever mentioned , or even seems to consider , the hard-pressed taxpayers of the nation state as you seek to construct this fragile and vain empire . #% One million people died in the fight for independence and another 100 000 have died in the current power struggles between Islamic militants and the military and among the minority Berber community seeking political and cultural recognition . #% The proposal in front of the House today , together with the amendments - all of which were agreed unanimously in committee - are the result of close collaboration between myself , on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee , and the Council and Commission , in an effort to reach an agreed formulation which could enable this directive to be dealt with in a single reading . #% Democracy and economic reform need the support of the EU and this House now more than ever before . #% Madam President , the citizens of Europe have the right to proper safety as they go about their business as tourism consumers . #% Can you guarantee that the Commission will not seek , under any circumstances , to use qualified majority voting to impose the withholding tax ? #% We should break at this stage and take the votes that remain at 5 p.m. this evening . #% He has done a service to the committee and also to this House by pointing out that this procedure appears to be almost always one-way . #% But we have not had a complaint in this particular case . #% We are proposing amendments which will strengthen the report in this respect . #% Depending on the context , these matters should be the responsibility of nations , NATO or the UN . #% The same applies to the European Union . #% The second directive on money laundering is already in conciliation and we are trying to get it through . #% We also warn the Solomon Islands that a suspension of aid may be needed there to restore democracy , peace and stability . #% Of course not everybody agrees with that analysis . #% Five hundred schools have been burnt down , thousands of people have fled from their homes and Governor Puteh has said that unemployment and poverty are now at alarming rates . #% Vietnam still restricts the press and tightly oversees internet users . #% Attending to this question in the House confirms the international status and interest which it deserves . #% Mr President , as I look around the Chamber this morning , I am 200 miles from home but I do not feel as if I am in another country ; instead , I feel as if I am on another planet . #% I speak as rapporteur on a European company statute and in particular the directive on involvement of workers . #% Hopefully we will be able to end the year with the better matching of budget and legislative procedures which we have been asking for . #% If that is so , it says a lot about the way the Union is squaring up for the challenge of enlargement . #% If I can be of greater help , my office is available to give you more detailed information if that is required and it would be happy to be helpful in these particular circumstances . #% Furthermore , it is now clear that the impact of the financial crisis will be severely felt by children and young people , for instance when the budgets are cut back on health and education . #% In particular I draw the attention of the House to Amendment No 20 , which talks about the importance of temporary work and agency work as a way of getting people into permanent full-time employment . #% My last point is to end where I began . #% I thank you , Commissioner , for that reply . #% The provisional legislature appointed by Beijing should not become a permanent puppet legislature . #% But we should recognise that Ukraine also has a coal industry and is pushing ahead to promote energy efficiency and renewable sources . #% They sink back deeper in their deck chairs and tan themselves in complacency believing Europe 's most successful industry needs neither help nor understanding . #% It is the biggest single underdeveloped policy that we have . #% Yet , if we are to add new languages , I would plead that amongst these must be the language of one part of my constituency , namely Cornish . #% If the Republic of Cyprus can in some way accommodate the North and include it in its discussions , fine - that is a matter for Cyprus - but can the Council confirm that the EU itself will not go back on the pledges it has made ? #% Not only should MEPs receive a fair day 's wage for a fair day 's work , we should be taxed on the same basis as those who send us here . #% Madam President , like everyone else , I too can endorse the package that has been assembled as a compromise . #% However , in the sphere of public broadcasting it is essential to remember that , in accordance with the Amsterdam Protocol , in the system of public broadcasting in Member States , it is up to each Member State to specify the financial and organisational structure of public service broadcasting . #% But , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination . #% It is an absolute insult to Parliament that it was brought back in virtually the same form within 18 months of its initial rejection . #% Without doubt much of the responsible sector of the cosmetics industry has taken considerable strides in moving towards fewer tests on animals , but public opinion is well-grounded and it is good that it has been reflected , not just in the past , but strongly reiterated and strengthened in the Roth-Behrendt report . #% A word to those such as the British Conservatives who carp on the sidelines : if you are for Europe , you should be for the Constitution . #% We will only start to make real progress when we finally get serious about health systems . #% I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government . #% EU money is easy money -- provided you fill in the forms nicely , or forge them . #% The great majority of the paper 's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform . #% Nevertheless , there is great concern in Parliament , in particular in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , that Parliament seemed not to have been involved as we would have hoped from the earliest stages . #% However , given the astonishing recent growth of India 's economy and its emerging global big-power status , our partnership must now deepen . #% It means delivering on equality at work ; it means that you do not use language which incites hatred and attacks on individuals simply because of who they are ; it means respecting the human rights of others , including their right to assembly and to be protected from violence - including state violence . #% Would it not be icing on the cake if we could acknowledge at that time that broad agreements had been reached between the European Union and his country of South Africa ? #% He is facing the death penalty because he reported on the ecological disaster of nuclear submarines in the Murmansk area . #% Sadly , I have not been approached by any Bavarian barmaids , but my door is always open should they wish to see me . #% What we are exploring here tonight in this crowded House is the question of linkage . #% There would seem to be scope for the admirable dictum : `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it '' . #% This resolution draws attention to the fact and seeks to find ways in which these groups can be influenced . #% Finally , thank you for your very kind remarks which were reported to me by my visitors ' group . #% In this debate we must not let the best be the enemy of the good . #% But things went wrong , did they not ? #% 
We said at the outset that while we were concerned with issues of public health and safety , we are not a committee of public safety in the French revolutionary sense , calling for heads , calling for show trials . #% I am sure the Commission will remind us of that but I shall resist those sort of temptations when I come back to you in two months time . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , the great investor , Warren Buffet , once said ` when the tide goes down , you kind of get to see who is not wearing a bathing costume ' . #% Thus , given the outcome of this common position and its unopposed endorsement from members of the Committee on Transport , the rapporteur , Mr Bradbourn , believes we can progress towards the second reading of the Marco Polo Programme without the need for wholesale change . #% I can not wait for the other directives coming along on small pleasure craft and the small spark ignition engine which will complete the story . #% Nevertheless , no one actually disputes his victory . #% I would like to summarise where I see this legislation has improved or changed for the better during our deliberations . #% We have a saying in my country that if you think education is expensive , try ignorance . #% This report is extremely important , because although Mrs Theato 's report accepts some of the Council 's amendments , we have to say that we accept them with a degree of reluctance because we know whence they come . #% The safety of blood , as we all know , is paramount . #% It is only the pro-active involvement of Europe that will assure the two sides that Union membership profoundly and radically changes the context of their mutual relationship . #% Because the Middle East is being used as a ball that is being batted between one group of nation states and another . #% Private sector provision has delivered the goods . #% There are a range of issues outstanding . #% We know from good practice in a number of Member States , of which Sweden is probably regarded as the best example , that where governments take this seriously , the provisions start to work effectively . #% That is hardly the way ahead . #% If they do not pay , citizens can lose their possessions , their livelihoods , be made bankrupt and even go to jail . #% I ask the House to remember that state aid , in this context , is rather like a Band-Aid or a sticking plaster being applied to a gaping wound . #% I now hear that this issue is being addressed and that the Commission will be coming forward with proposals to alleviate this problem . #% Let us recall just two key points of the context of those discussions . #% We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured . #% They were denied full participation in the WTO , their legal representatives were expelled from the WTO and then , to cap it all , an American chaired the appeal . #% It is wrong if we are making decisions in this Parliament based on faulty technical equipment . #% I wonder whether you would accept a genuine mistake . #% We in Britain have complied with the beef ban . #% Finally , in terms of milk chocolate , the decision to strike out the derogations on milk chocolate has no business in this debate . #% However , this is only the start and I am sure -- and hope -- that the Commissioner will leave that structure in place for us to follow through . #% So I would urge the Parliament , and all those who have come to listen to this debate , to support the amendment that has been tabled by Glyn Ford to this report which I think will render it just about compatible with the treaty provision and make sure that this Parliament remains within the constitution . #% They will be killed by diseases of the heart or lungs or by cancer because they inhale tobacco smoke . #% Credible estimates suggest that the costs of implementation in the UK alone could range between EUR 15 and 30 billion . #% But I do not think , colleagues , that means we should stand aside and ignore what is happening at the moment . #% Therefore , I welcome Parliament 's proposals to require new vehicles to be fitted with digital tachographs at least from 2006 . #% In fact , it is another Chile written small . #% My group , however , rejects the concept of a safe third country . #% The problem therefore is not whether the bath of hot water is half-full or empty , but that too many Member States are not putting the plug into the bath in the first place . #% Finally , Mrs Larive summarised what we have to do when she said that we should give mainstreaming a chance . #% I look forward to welcoming our new colleagues from these countries to our Parliament next month so that we can begin building together the Europe our 500 million citizens deserve . #% Thirdly , the whole system is so complex with so many committees , and agendas and procedures that are difficult to get hold of , that it is opaque and not transparent for the wider public . #% This is something about which we feel very strongly . #% I have two points to make in that respect . #% 1999 - the year in which Freddy Blak found huge errors , fraud and problems in the accounts , scandals all of them including , for example , the wonderful Washington delegation that warranted a whole two paragraphs in the report . #% There is just one particular point that I would like to flag up . #% The latest information on the Lockerbie disaster suggests that the bomb was in fact planted at Heathrow , where security is very good . #% First , we are not calling for the creation of a new expensive agency or institute . #% So I , for one , will not repent and I will certainly not join Mr Bushill-Matthews on Wednesday . #% I would prefer a more modest approach , with the European Union focusing only on those areas were it can genuinely add practical value through humanitarian and development assistance , electoral observation and the like . #% Let us have a rest , a good rest , at least once a week on a Sunday . #% Codes of conduct have to be properly enforced . #% We stand by the split vote . #% One of the problems is that you can often go into a supermarket now anywhere in the European Union and buy a chicken without being absolutely sure where it has come from and to what standards it has been produced . #% The European Parliament I believe has a role to play in arguing that the European Union must bring pressure to bear on the Sri Lankan government to seek peace . #% That is one of your crucial responsibilities in the new allocation of portfolios in the Commission . #% In particular , I felt , along with many of my colleagues , that the Palestinian authority , which receives EUR 120 million a year from the EU , should have done more to restrain the suicide bombers and Islamic terrorists . #% In denouncing the violence perpetrated in Colombia , we should be making a careful examination of the situation to see if there is any way , difficult though it is , in which we could contribute to the ending of the violence and the restoration of full peace . #% A good example of the failure to do this is the urban waste water directive which the government of Brussels can not afford to comply with . #% On this side of the House we are as one . #% We should bear in mind that it is a bathing waters directive , not a recreation directive , so we should not venture into the deeper waters of boating and deep sea diving : we should instead restore it to what it started off as -- a bathing water directive . #% There are some enthusiasts here with an interest in addressing these issues and we have to think about ways in which we can have an input into these technical processes . #% Organic regulations allow for the presence of up to 5 % non-organic ingredients . #% Paragraph 19 says : ` Regrets the 1994 triennial inventory check has not been completed by the end of 1996 ' . #% Regrettably , the joint Hamas declaration with Fatah of 27 June , allegedly implicitly recognising Israel , reportedly remains an ambiguous document and Hamas does not clearly renounce violence . #% We support the principle of one member one vote when it comes to decision-taking , and a double majority system implies that a Governing Council member from a big Member State is representing that Member State , rather than voting for the eurozone as a whole . #% The references which the excellent rapporteur makes are to the fact that we now have a parliamentary status and a very different way of working but , most important , the ACP representation is of elected Members of Parliament and not of ambassadors , which used to be the case in the past . #% I am grateful to the honourable Member for raising this question . #% Louise is right : if there is therapy that helps , for example beta interferons , then it must be made available to all sufferers . #% Fourthly , paragraph 30 calls on Member States to work on the housing and transport sectors as areas where we can dramatically improve our energy efficiency and our conservation of energy . #% 
The Balkan states are in a very vulnerable position . #% While it is fashionable to concentrate on newly emerging diseases , we can not afford to lose sight of familiar problems which affect huge numbers of patients . #% Mr President , the Member States are in reality the EU 's paymasters without discretion . #% Those women are now so desperate that they are selling part of their food rations in order to buy wood in the markets to try to avoid the attacks they experience as they leave the camps to get firewood . #% Was it the commercial engineer you have employed as the Chief Accountant of the Commission presently ? #% We can do very little at European level to have large social programmes of the kind to which I think you were referring . #% It will make for more qualified majority voting and more continuity in the chairmanship of the European Council . #% We are aiming to equip their citizens to join an integrated free movement area with a single market and common values . #% There is , however , a dilemma in seeking to use a financial framework for the purposes of moving the Moroccan authorities more in the direction that the honourable Member would want . #% However , the report also raises some serious questions that are to be addressed if we are to maintain the efforts to improve food safety . #% That is a fundamental flaw in the whole procedure . #% The priority of enlargement , along with the other two priorities , makes real sense for the European Union . #% Quite simply , we can not accept a situation where the Commission foists upon us any changes to the UK 's government structures . #% We also note that Vietnam 's parliament , the National Assembly , has expressed an interest in entering into a constructive dialogue with this House on these and other issues . #% That really has to be the way forward . #% This would be restricted to the withdrawal , treatment and possible destruction of products . #% I want to stress two amendments which are important . #% You will find that child health and welfare has progressed dramatically since the early 1990s . #% I very much welcome the proposal , because if we can guarantee the life of EHLASS for another five years , for the duration of the injury prevention programme , that will be an extremely good thing . #% The comitology procedures which are proposed are restrictive and challenge the democratic role of this Parliament to which the Commission should be accountable . #% That is why I welcome Mrs Gál 's report and the establishment of the fundamental rights agency . #% Finally , I would draw attention to the issue of civil liability . #% We also feel that the Council was lethargic early on in its response to the Commission 's very necessary proposals for health and safety and the treatment of risk materials throughout the Community . #% Israel could think hard and re-examine her approach towards helping Palestine to trade freely , without adding on costs and without using the wall to further depress agricultural or factory production . #% I can fully understand why money must go into the reserve and I can fully understand why there is increasing concern about the way the agencies operate , but we need to give them the appropriate resources to do their job and that particularly applies in the case of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . #% I hope the Commission and Council will place emphasis on this aspect in their dealings with Ukraine . #% Mr President , I would like to commend Mrs Pack on this report . #% Where is Parliament 's constant concern on these and other human rights in the region outside of Cuba ? #% Today we begin the European twenty-first century . #% We must at least agree - and I want the summit to do this - on an integration strategy , including better rights for long-term legal migrants . #% The rapporteur - the chairman of our committee - asked me to deputise for him tonight because I was the one that proposed that compromise , which is that we have a fourth vice-chairman of each parliamentary committee and a sixth Quaestor for the remainder of this Parliament , until 2009 , but that we do not make it a permanent change . #% Take the example of the arrest warrant , which all the Member States have ratified but only eight have transposed into national law . #% My understanding is that the patent error can be corrected either by the patent owner applying to correct the document or by a third party filing an opposition which I understand has already been done . #% I will end my comments tonight by seeking - maybe via your good offices , Commissioner - to put some pressure behind the Council to speed up their work , because we really do want to make sure we get a common position from the Council before the summer so that we can move swiftly on with this in the autumn . #% Mr President , this is a remarkable report : broad in its sweep and penetrating and positive in so many of its observations . #% . -- Mr President , this report covers ten diverse fields , practically all EU areas , from peace and security to human rights and from Lisbon to Laeken . #% I think he deserves a lot of credit for that , and it reflects well on Parliament too . #% Yet France 's record of applying EU law is one of the worst , its attitude to trans-frontier mergers is obstructionist , it has deliberately failed to meet its obligations under the stability and growth pact and it has consistently slowed down the pace of CAP reform . #% Mr President , you will understand that in my constituency , in Essex in the UK , the menace of drugs misuse is bitterly understood . #% As people have pointed out , in cases where things are medically necessary , with a need for urgent treatment , we already have a system in place under social security coordination . #% Mr President , I represent the south-west of England , where in recent years an increasing number of dead dolphins have been washed ashore . #% It is not only the poultry sector that suffers but also the cereal sector , because five billion chickens eat an awful lot of wheat . #% That said , it seems to me , as Mr Swoboda has already said , that the current legislation that exists on phone tapping - let us call it what it is - appears to be correct . #% Equally , the ELDR Group amendment is a contradiction in terms : there is no such thing as a sustainable level of hunting for critically endangered species . #% I would also like to see exit signs in case of emergency . #% Yet few things contribute more to the opaqueness and complexity of European legislation than the habit of having sets of directives amending previous directives , without the texts as a whole ever being consolidated into a single document . #% We are dealing with an industry which is very highly regulated , one of most regulated industries in Europe , and we must take cognizance of the fact that contrary to what my colleague suggested , the containment in these flasks was not breached . #% Amsterdam will make it impossible to adopt any legislation that falls under the Codecision Procedure without the explicit agreement of the European Parliament . #% However , the main issue is : does the proposal in front of us actually achieve that ? #% As a member of the advisory board of the Global Reporting Initiative , can I endorse the objective of transparency in paragraph 15 , but also ask that the imminent public consultation by the Commission on non-financial disclosure moves decisively towards the principle of integrated reporting on financial , social , environmental and human rights impacts by companies . #% Here I would take issue slightly with my good friend Commissioner Liikanen . #% In conclusion , I am proud to be the rapporteur of this report because it is a clear demonstration that regardless of our political views on Europe and its future role , there are many areas like this where we can work together in a way which makes a practical difference to many people - both those who are dependent on our care and those who have to implement our rules and regulations . #% My one disappointment about the enlargement process is that the passion has gone out of it . #% Lastly , let me give credit and pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency for the work it has been doing in both these areas , in relation both to a healthy people and a healthy environment , because that will lead to the healthy economy that Lisbon can bring us all in the very near future . #% Can the Commissioner state how he thinks that will help stop the laundering of wood in China and that region ? #% There must be a high level of consumer protection , higher than in many of our Member States . #% I wonder if it might be possible for the Commissioner in his reply to dwell on the criticisms of underspending sometimes levelled at the MEDA programme . #% Secondly , does he agree with me that perhaps Parliament , too , could support his efforts by putting more emphasis on monitoring and enforcement ? #% . I welcome this report on the measures needed to protect the elver industry in Europe . #% I do not personally think that in Amendment No 7 where there is a proposal that we have to have an absolutely universal system of ISO standard microchips , that you can expect all animals fitted with a chip to be of that universal variety in the early stages . #% To us , there is no trade-off between sustainable multilateral environmental disciplines and multilateral attempts at poverty alleviation . #% With such fast-changing science and a host of possible unknown effects , it is important to protect Europe ' s people and our environment . #% We are concerned that some measures might result in infringements of the rights and responsibilities of Member States , such as the concept of a Citizens ' Europe or some aspects of the Stockholm Programme . #% I have my doubts over just how far the UK Government will push for this idea . #% I would be most grateful if she would try to depart from her prepared remarks and deal with these issues . #% Our joint resolution makes a series of demands on the Indonesian Government and I hope very much that it is listening and that it will heed those concerns . #% 
Late payment regularly throttles many viable businesses , especially small businesses . #% I hope when we vote on this - I am sure the vote will be successful - that we can send this along to the members of the Convention and that our Parliament representatives on the Convention can present this as Parliament 's position for the future . #% He has highlighted that 50 million of those may be unemployed , 5 million of them in Germany . #% I would suggest that part of its and the Commission 's responsibilities in this new environment is to improve not just monetary cooperation in the world but also to promote greater synergy in the fiscal and economic areas . #% But it is the next step in the new Parliament which will determine whether we have the courage and determination to turn those aims into reality by ensuring the major chronic diseases of this century do not bedevil the next . #% It is something that needs to be sorted out so that the people of Europe will understand . #% I believe we will succeed in what we have put our hands to today . #% My group also wanted to have a paragraph in about possible sanctions , inviting the Council ... #% One explanation I have had from the Sessional Services is that someone from the EPP Group had been in touch to say that point had been withdrawn . #% My own view in 1999 that accession was not feasible without unification . #% Despite the rhetoric , the creation of the Women 's Ministry , the Karzai Government pursues anti-women policies , and there is no legal protection , while older legal systems still in position prohibit them from getting help . #% I say that because there were times during the debate in the committee when the central issue of transportation of radioactive material seemed to get lost in the wider debate between the pro- and anti-nuclear lobbies . #% In its quite unprecedented fashion it can arbitrarily allocate vast amounts of taxpayers ' money towards the establishment of chairs in universities and to bankrolling educational institutions with deeply worrying titles , such as ` the College of Europe ' or ` the European University Institute ' , and dozens of others . #% I have been listening to Chinese politicians for the past 13 years and that tone of deep resentment is either on the surface or very shallowly beneath the surface . #% In our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are . #% I hope the Austrian Presidency will do as well . #% The functioning of Parliament , the relationship with the executive and the judicial system and the overall functioning of the rule of law : all are questioned . #% We nevertheless believe that the EC has already relegated these bodies to the sidelines in respect of fisheries management by starving them of adequate funding and insisting that their role be purely ` advisory ' . #% One is Commission reform . #% This is not just about bananas ; it is about trade with developing countries overall . #% I feel that my experience on the Board has helped me put together a reasonable report which does not favour any particular sort of waste treatment . #% And while countering illegal immigration and abuse of asylum laws is important , governments must respect their obligations under the Geneva Convention to grant asylum to genuine refugees and treat them with compassion and dignity , not demonise them . #% There is going to be a substantial reduction in sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions which are the main causes of acid rain and ground-level ozone with a consequent improvement in the environmental conditions for human health . #% We also have the situation of a more precise legislative programme since the PDB and we need to assess the changes . #% When will the programme be ready so that we will actually have some harmonised statistical collecting across the EU ? #% Of course the WHO has a role , with its cascades of information ; of course national and local health bodies have a clear role in control and surveillance ; but now so does the EU , and rightly so , when millions of our citizens choose to move across the continent to work , to study , or , crucially at this time of year , to go on holiday . #% We can not know about the WTO . #% I would like to make some general remarks and then touch on my report . #% Is Commissioner Marin still prepared to say this ? #% The government of Nepal itself must restore the rule of law and order and there is a need to set up an independent investigation into the allegations against the security forces . #% Mr Barrot also spoke about the need to recognise the external costs of transport and Mr Albertini spoke about some of the amendments . #% That is the thrust of our approach to this budget . #% British farmers need help now , not the promise of compensation later when some of them will be bankrupt and beyond help . #% Not merely is this significant , as it takes China into the world community of nations , it also brings China into the evolving new system of decision-making in an increasingly interdependent world . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to add my voice to those who earlier paid their respects to the memory of President Pflimlin . #% Since 1996 no cases of BSE in the eligible age group - that is 6 months to 30 months - have been discovered . #% They want to address this problem . #% The first is : what mechanism would the Council envisage for informing of Parliament prior to the adoption of a position by the Council with regard to the Energy Community Treaty institutions ? #% I commend all the people who have contributed to it and we look forward to supporting it . #% They should use a common approach in assessing their annual reports , and then comparison will become fruitful and productive . #% We need to face the fact that there is a pressing need not merely for a moratorium on debt servicing but also for debt cancellation . #% It is about time that we resolved the problems in this world before flying off in search of others . #% If EU Member States really have aspirations to play a greater role in security policy , then let them contribute to enforcement of the no-fly zone , and ensure that whatever sanctions regime is imposed is rigorously enforced . #% We believe there are some 107 casualties ; it is known that there are 7 dead so far and 4 British diplomats are missing . #% Kazakhstan is travelling the road from a Soviet republic to an independent and democratic state . #% Some convergence of national rules on consumer contracts is clearly desirable , though this should not be used as an excuse to delay the single market . #% It will have disappeared on to the roads mainly , with all the consequences that will entail . #% The report describes the conflicts fought over minerals , farm produce , land and tax revenues by criminal groups linked to the Zimbabwean armed forces which have , for example , transferred at least five billion dollars ' worth of assets from the state mining company in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to companies under its control . #% He named the months of the year after his national heroes , starting with himself and his mother . #% The only way that we can act efficiently , effectively and humanely is to provide that support from the public purse and through public institutions . #% This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits . #% Gordon Brown keeps on saying it is not a constitution , when all the EU leaders say it is : Valéry Giscard d'Estaing , José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , Angela Merkel , even our own President of President said so in this Chamber a short while ago . #% We still do not have a solution on that and that is why we maintain the amendments and insist they are placed in the common position . #% What started out as a little local dispute over water supply has cost hundreds of lives , displaced thousands of people and brought the country to the brink of civil war . #% Unfortunately , at this juncture we can not go beyond that undertaking because of the limitations on our legal rights . #% We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes . #% Is he wanting to share with us the difficulties that come from the confusion we still have about tallow derivatives and about pharmaceuticals which seem , within the committees , to be inducing some sort of paralysis ? #% Firstly at national level : those countries that have said ` no ' or that risk saying ` no ' must be able to think and tell the rest of the European Union how they see the way forward , what adjustments they think are necessary . #% Legally , it would have been very difficult to prove whether a worker had contracted skin cancer from the workplace , the back garden or the beach . #% At a time when the generosity of people across Europe and the world towards the victims of the tsunami disaster is evident to all , it is inexplicable why this Parliament is committing a considerable sum of money to a programme of events and receptions in support of the European Constitution . #% Mr President , I also wish to welcome the presence of the whole Commission and deplore the absence of many colleagues , which is in part because we all have TV monitors in our offices and it is so easy to watch the debates whilst working in your office . #% Since its introduction the euro has been a global success story rapidly establishing itself as a global reserve currency that has challenged the dollar 's monopoly . #% We need flexibility of application in the rules on state aid . #% I was so pleased when the Finnish Government decided to make mental health promotion one of their priorities for their presidency . #% Indeed , the 1991 Convention on the enforcement of criminal sentences - which otherwise would be relevant here - is not yet in force some ten years after it was signed . #% It would be verging on the criminal not to deploy resources allocated for combating diseases such as cancer . #% 
That should be the number-one concern , not only of the European Environment Bureau , but also of those who care in this House and in the Commission about ensuring that we move forward together to improve Europe 's environment . #% There is no evidence that taxpayers ' money spent on projects at EU level is more effective than when it is spent on national programmes , although the sharing of experience and best practice may make a positive contribution to the reduction of violence of this type . #% To those who say we have gone too fast and that the Commission or the Council are urging us to move too quickly during this presidency , I would say simply that we are repairing the neglect of decades in which the very variety and self-sufficiency of our foodstuffs hid great disasters , from BSE , to dioxins , to some of the scourges of the present day . #% Fair Trade is a success story . #% We need to ask to what extent the European Commission is prepared to use the provisions of Articles 12 and 41 of the general regulation on the structural funds to delay granting money where there is inadequate information on the impact of the projects which have applied for the money on the environment . #% The rapporteur 's amendments recognize that and certainly construct a system which would ensure that . #% The Commission 's recent announcement of its proposal for establishing such bodies is welcome and we look forward to speedy progress in this regard . #% Thanks to one of our colleagues , Mr Sonneveld , I and two of my colleagues from Britain had the opportunity earlier this year of visiting a veal-raising unit in the Netherlands . #% Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law . #% Finally , we recognized possible problems and suggested that the Commission should set up a committee procedure to enable countries to change their minds quickly and easily if they feel they have made a mistake or not understood what has been sent to them . #% Madam President , industry complains about regulation and interference from Brussels . #% Can you imagine the stress that would be caused if advice went out that said that carrots , for instance , could be safely eaten by adults and yet not by children ? #% I know that Stephen Hughes hopes to be back ; I also hope to be back , but next time with more support . #% I hope that there will be support for those , because they go into a considerable amount of important detail . #% Sadly , however , this region remains paralysed by frozen conflicts , the most recent of which is , of course , Russia 's de facto occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia which , in our view , are Georgian sovereign territory . #% I shall not vote for the Prodi Commission . #% This seems to us perverse . #% These countries should be proud of it and see it as a wonderful opportunity . #% Mr President , first of all I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their reports . #% As the Palestinians see all hopes of a viable , independent Palestinian state disappearing before their eyes , what is the European Union going to do about it ? #% If the Commission is going to be able to defend its monopoly on the right of initiative , it must continue to exercise it in that responsible way , to maintain a dialogue with Parliament and take up the legitimate concerns expressed in this Parliament . #% It could also potentially put EU election observers at risk . #% On Mr Viola 's report , I think we have to say that the fact that it is unamended and went through Committee unamended shows the consensus from all the groups as far as these guidelines are concerned - what we expect from the budgets of the other institutions . #% Consequently , it is ironic that Parliament has chosen to put this item of primary legislation as the last item on Monday evening , although , naturally , I hope that we have saved the best until last for your edification . #% It is significant that the island country , the larger island country , secured in the course of these months under this Commission no additional appointments at A1 level by promotion . #% It is also clear that as more countries integrate their taxation and social security systems , we need to take action to tackle the resulting anomalies , which can result in double payments . #% I thank the rapporteur for all his work . #% At the last part-session in Strasbourg the Commission was going to give us a statement on that matter . #% Mr President , also on the Minutes , I would draw to your attention a report in this morning 's Times newspaper which suggests that four of our colleagues have been given an ultimatum to sign a document by 3 p.m. this afternoon , failing which their rights as Members of the House will be infringed . #% But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives . #% I am also pleased to see that catering waste from abroad , such as may come from aeroplanes landing in our country , has been upgraded to category 1 . #% But if we express our very strong reservations and to ask for clear review , this will give our citizens protection now and offer us progress in this very difficult area . #% Recruitment is also hampered by restrictions on family reunion , business tells us . #% On 8 June , Parliament voted for ` a significantly strengthened LIFE + programme ' . #% The first is Turkey 's history of military intervention in the political process . #% It is a situation that needs a sympathetic response . #% This is an issue which is now entirely without contention . #% Finally , on the European information centres , we receive no service in Essex . #% As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months . #% Madam President , I would like to raise a few concerns I have about developing countries in relation to the MAI , particularly , as others have pointed out , that they have been excluded from the negotiations even though those negotiations have a very significant impact on them . #% Mr President , I thank Mr Solana for his extremely interesting statement . #% Central to this are the links with these parliaments that transit through the EDF and financing . #% Similarly , the improved text which I voted for today reflects more accurately the views of thousands of individuals and interest groups in dealing with the cumulative effects of toxic chemicals found in hundreds of household products . #% Could you also ensure that Mr Hannan states the position in his declaration of financial interests in advance of the referendum in Denmark so that the citizens of that country can see where the money came from ? #% Mr President , when I left the House of Commons in the United Kingdom in 1997 I thought I had got away from debates that took place after 10 p.m. . #% On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks . #% The comments after Hampton Court were from those amazed that nothing happened . #% We are told that Alan remains alive and secure , but not who is holding him . #% I thought we were all agreed on that point . #% I would like to record our appreciation of Tunisia 's recent hosting of the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society from 16 to 18 November . #% One rare example of common interest is in the fight against international Islamist terrorism , as China has problems with its own Uighur Muslim minorities . #% Clearly this exercise is cosmetic , designed more to publicise the EU label than to overcome the Congo 's problems . #% We call for confidence-building measures and greater democracy : democracy can not flourish in such circumstances . #% They do not need to be in a position where , proportionally , they plant their flags around every seat at the new authority 's table . #% By ensuring that there is a threshold in each Member State at which someone taking control of a company has to launch a full bid for the other shares , this directive stops creeping control of a company . #% However , the directive , as it currently stands , is only applicable to directives listed in Annex 1 and there are a number of directives they would have liked to have seen within the ambit of this directive , such as toy safety , low voltage gas appliances and personal protective equipment . #% The motivation for the motion appears to be unnecessarily confrontational , rather than a genuine attempt to promote the cause of tolerance and non-discrimination . #% . Mr President , I just want to thank those Members who have taken part in this debate . #% I look forward in the not too distant future to returning to Beirut , a city of which I have the fondest memories , but also to welcoming more people from the Lebanon , especially parliamentarians , here . #% Mr President , I had no idea that I had that effect on microphones ! #% I should like to confirm that this report is available . #% Madam President , there is a political dimension to this , which Mr Haarder mentioned . #% It is absurd to claim that the rules of the Community demand that young people should continue to be targeted in this way through sports sponsorship and through trendy designer products . #% I can not find anything about this in the Rules . #% We are also dealing with other health areas and starting , as the Commissioner has said , with communicable diseases , not least those with drug-resistant strains , which threaten our communities . #% It is true that within the European Parliament we now have a fantastic variety of representation of traditions and cultures , but this is not what Europe is going to be about over the next five to ten years . #% 
What we are trying to do to the least developed countries is unacceptable . #% Mr President , Commissioner Byrne , some of us appreciate your dilemma and your unwillingness to rush to judgement . #% In conclusion , if the European Council , under the leadership of the UK Presidency , is to play a significant and constructive role in the peace process , it must ensure that concerns of economic and political expediency are not permitted to override the fundamental rights of a people that has suffered enough . #% We have to address some of the problems that stem from peacekeeping . #% Nearly 50 % of our money goes on agriculture -- I make it less than 0.5 % on culture . #% I ask you , Madam President , on behalf of Parliament to write urgently to the Nigerian authorities to press for respect for this Parliament 's will consistent with human rights law and our February 1998 resolution . #% People have talked very much about how this group of workers is particularly vulnerable . #% I hope that the Commission will play its role in making sure that we work alongside the African leaders , who want this kind of change , and in making sure that it happens . #% Commissioner Lamy , in our meeting this morning , I asked you what the status of your Seattle mandate was . #% Secondly , I would say that classifying mining waste as waste is very difficult when you consider that large amounts of it are simply crushed rock and quite similar to products that you would get from any quarry in the Union . #% Already in the UK , Mr Straw is planning that in rape cases the accused man will become guilty until proven innocent , on the basis of the testimony of one person - the woman in question . #% The legacy of ancient Egypt , Greece and Rome shaped our culture , our literature , our very understanding of the common European heritage . #% Parliament has a Treaty right to have its questions properly answered . #% We spend a lot of time policing ourselves in Europe , but the main problems are countries which are not bound by any scruples or international rules . #% If the Commission as an institution is serious about the involvement of Parliament , it should be joining with us in calling for an interinstitutional agreement to give Parliament a formal say in the preparations for the spring Council . #% A common framework of policies is needed if we are to avoid the risk of a trade war with the United States , with appeals to the WTO , and to curb the risk of divisions amongst ourselves across the European Union . #% I hope this message is now being heard by the Burmese regime . #% As you know , on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth . #% We are not as flexible as I would like . #% That of course links into the resolution that you have before you : 42 % of deaths in the EU come from CVD problems . #% Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty stipulate the need to respect human rights and the rule of law . #% Who could argue with the need for control of the use of chemicals and the protection of public safety ? #% Nonetheless , at that time Spinelli was able to build up a remarkable consensus , and it worked . #% I know that there are people in the Netherlands who disagree with that and I would be interested to know why . #% It groups them together and that is very important . #% The financial services action plan itself gathers together many of the directives necessary for completion of the risk capital action plan , including most of what I have already mentioned . #% Thirdly , there are those intended to reinforce the role of the social partners in the Agency 's network in the Member States -- a very important point -- and those intended to reinforce cooperation with other Community bodies in the social policy area . #% While some aspects of this report will form an invaluable improvement in Member States with very low levels of maternity provision , these amendments may lead to social regression in other countries . #% There are many points that I welcome in his report ; the recognition of the need to deliver the Lisbon conclusions , the encouragement and support for SMEs and the need to improve employment of disadvantaged groups in society . #% I am also very pleased we got such a large majority in Parliament for that own-initiative report . #% We must give this policy bottom-up motion so that it is really working and dynamic and represents the wishes of the area it is there to serve . #% It began with high hopes and prime ministerial panache . #% I believe that the parliamentary dimension of the Mediterranean is going to be of increasing importance . #% I do not believe Mr Fischler 's guidelines will be adequate . #% It can bring benefits and it should be considered carefully with proper risk assessment and risk management , but without scaremongering . #% We must also take account of the very real worries among developing countries , especially on the issue of minerals and mining , and ensure that we do not damage their fragile economies . #% I would like you to know that hopefully , between the vote on Thursday and the not-too-distant future , we can all be in a position where we can see the Commission 's proposals coming to fruition and we can get on with the job of making Europe the place that the citizens expect it to be and not associated with the great mystique that it represents for too many of them right now . #% Mr President , I should like to make a couple of general points and a couple of specific points about this report . #% I would also take issue with the assertion that the tenth EDF represents a significant improvement on the ninth EDF . #% His profile in the this week said that he had built his own house and loves gardening . #% We look to the European Commission to do something , but it is wrong at this stage to start talking about having exclusions for certain areas or little glass cabinets where people can smoke , because somebody has to clean those areas afterwards . #% Mr President , my colleague , Mr Menrad , has put a great deal of thought into his work and raises some interesting points concerning the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the existing directive . #% That is why I support the idea of an interinstitutional agreement setting out exactly the Commission 's role in the CFSP . #% I would also like to thank Commissioner Fischler once more for his support and also ask him to introduce an audit to be carried out every two years on the availability and success of measures put in place to support young farmers . #% Could I thank the President-in-Office for his very full answer . #% I urge him to stand firm on the rebate and to honour the clear commitments he has made . #% We have discovered that Member States , even if they want to know what is going on , do not necessarily have the right or the mechanisms to find out , let alone the political will . #% In my own Member State we have had ambitious plans , aiming to have the most competitive broadband system in the developed world by 2005 . #% Markets in the North remain restricted for many , as the most important developing country exports seek access . #% On that EUR 21 million , the Budgets Committee accepted the proposal from the Committee on Culture that EUR 1 million should be set aside for training future MEPs from the candidate countries . #% In 1994 we argued very strongly the case to have some kind of discussions on distance . #% They are interested in personal power and the fruits of criminal activity . #% Mr President , last week in Strasbourg , I condemned the brazen contempt that we show for public opinion , for the views of voters and for democracy itself when we repeatedly disregard the verdict of successive referendums . #% The enhanced GSP system obviously works as a system of incentives . #% Yes , there has been some success but it really is the tip of the iceberg . #% Commissioner van den Broek began his statement by saying that he was going to give a report on the 12 candidate countries . #% How democratic is that ? #% Romania , Albania and Bosnia have granted immunity and Macedonia , too , I understand . #% On reflection , I have decided not to support amendments to raise the boiling point defining VOCs to 280 ° C , but to stick with the ecolabel standards . #% Firstly , in its culture budget each year , Parliament helps a number of cultural organisations and networks such as the European Youth Orchestra and the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation . #% It would be remiss of me if I did not say at the outset that one of the problems facing agriculture is that it is going through the worst time it has ever had - I will not mention the problems facing British beef today . #% The January 2008 deadline is obviously what makes this year so crucial for EPAs . #% All ACP producers were being offered the same . #% This is a very worrying situation . #% On the question of staging the reform over a longer period , I simply remind the House that first of all , a substantial part of the House argues - rightly in my view - for sustained momentum of change , for the sake of our staff as well as for the sake of the institutions . #% A Director-General of the WTO very recently said that the WTO must be an organisation where the little guy not only has a say but feels that he is protected and defended . #% 
I would like to focus on the principles behind the proposal , rather than the detail , which has been covered very comprehensively by colleagues . #% For this reason , we voted against this report . #% It makes it clear that we are not creating some huge monolithic monster -- the mythology of the superstate that some people seem to fear . #% While we support the Treaty amendment , however , we do not support this report because what we have here is a wish list of unnecessary changes dreamt up at the last minute . #% Thirdly , we have to assess the progress which has been made on the screening of the acquis and on the evolution of the pre-accession strategy . #% Let them also tackle the problems of banking secrecy and tax havens which provide cover for money laundering . #% As Mr Cox said , it is destroying consumer confidence . #% I must say I am not sure that proposition is correct . #% This , however , is only one of the cases of land being distributed and then returned to a former owner . #% The problem is that the mission is being discussed behind closed doors and we need some democratic scrutiny . #% But that is exactly what is going on in my own country at the moment , with English students who want to study in Scotland being penalised financially by the Scottish Executive . #% In response to the publication of this information , this particular councillor , Councillor Dowding , has now been suspended for three months as a penalty for making public allegedly confidential information . #% I condemn Mr Titford for so doing . #% That is what the law says in most of our Member States . #% Last night the Secretary-General of the United Nations put forward his final plan for overcoming the divisions of Cyprus . #% First , in respect to economic data , Amendment No 2 makes two changes . #% As Dumas wrote , ` all for one and one for all ' : we need the European grid of energy which can resist any attempt to pick off any one of our Member States . #% They are not just imagining problems for the sake of it ; they are detailing specific problems in the common position that the Council simply did not foresee when it nodded it through . #% When I say the position of lawyers , I mean not just lawyers but also their clients and their clients ' access to justice . #% I reject that entirely . #% Every year 4 500 people die from asbestos-related diseases in the UK alone . #% What you represent is the professional political class in Europe , who of course are all in favour of the European Union . #% As Mr Solana knows from his previous appointment , many Allied states do not even fulfil their force commitments to NATO . #% I should like to see us focus on the longer-term strategic questions , such as the role of water supply in conflict prevention . #% That is necessary and right . #% I suspect it is more to do with compliance with the parliamentary clean air directive , as opposed to the parliamentary hot air directive which very often informs our debates . #% Just one recent report produced by the Work Foundation and by Birkbeck College in the United Kingdom showed graphically how employee involvement actually goes together with business success : the two go hand in hand . #% Could you ask for an investigation to see how it occurred and what steps are being taken to make sure that the culprit pays for the reprinting ? #% What we need is a system which acts in terms of the global interest and international objectives . #% We are anxious to know quickly because we need to know what will happen to these reports before we move to the general revision of the Rules of Procedure scheduled later this year . #% The Green Group has re-tabled several of my original amendments that got voted down in committee . #% Publish without delay the conclusions and any minority conclusions of the board on any assessed risk , and hold meetings of the board in public . #% I know that this is a measure that will be greeted with considerable support and enthusiasm by those who will see that at last we are beginning to realise that we have to get together in order to achieve ends such as this . #% First , I would like to say that I am grateful to Giovanni Berlinguer and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy for an excellent opinion . #% The Weber report required a series of amendments that would have improved on the rapporteur 's draft . #% We want to play our part . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Evans , not only on the work she has put in on this , but her very fair and lucid summation of the proposal as it left committee . #% If you are expecting the people of the United Kingdom to make any sort of arrangement for their lifeblood , the very lifeblood of the nation state , and to base it on people who have no fundamental interest in the wellbeing of the United Kingdom , I can tell you that it will not happen . #% The standpoints of the three institutions were difficult to reconcile in such a short space of time and even the Council , under the wonderful Swedish Presidency , found it difficult to achieve a political consensus , or at least a qualified majority , within itself . #% I suggest to you that one of the things that we must work on is to ensure that small and medium sized enterprises get the benefits of this revolution . #% It is our responsibility to keep that hope and opportunity alive . #% It is difficult to resist those arguments if existing Member States , which should be well able to transpose and implement , have not done so . #% Penalising people for using roads is an extremely dangerous step , yet this is exactly what the report advocates . #% However , I wish to raise the question of land eligibility , which appears to be a particular problem in the UK . #% Yet this transition will need to be carefully managed if some of the poorest people in the world are not to bear the burden of the industrialised world 's profligacy in carelessly abusing the planet 's environmental resources . #% I hope British MEPs stick up for Britain . #% -- Mr President , it is not often that this Chamber witnesses real political drama . #% Why it has not yet been fully used and what should its future be ? #% As a part of the pre-accession phase of Turkey 's candidacy , we should try to establish a functional forum where military as well as civilian and economic issues should be shared between us . #% I welcome the work of the Irish presidency , particularly the Foreign Minister , Mr Spring , in trying to take the initiative towards developing the EU 's role in relation to the Middle East peace process . #% Its current opposition to Taiwan 's WHO bid -- and of course Taiwan would be a key player in preventing any future bird flu pandemic , should that arise -- is frankly inconsistent and makes China look like a big bully . #% The question ought to be : what has the Council - which is a Dutch Council - done to persuade its own government to extradite Gerard Hoogendik to the USA for offences which have been laid at his door , namely that he has been smuggling and distributing adulterated drugs into the US ? #% Seven years ago I was in the Parliament in Papua New Guinea having a far better time than I am here . #% As the House knows and has repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the Union 's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures . #% Recent opinion polls in Norway indicate that public perceptions of the Union are changing ; that support for membership is growing and will inevitably dominate the political agenda at the next elections . #% Non-discrimination for disabled people has been described as the last great civil rights movement . #% So far as the transition period is concerned , many of us will have sympathy with the need for some form of transition because , clearly , if you amend the regulations in such a way that you move from a system which is being used over a long period of time to a completely new system some time will be required . #% In other words , if Council committees have the right to block the Commission and refer a measure back then Parliament should also have that right . #% Some people , including the last speaker , have talked about the fact that there will be a unique conjunction of events , in that the same pieces of spectrum will become available in every European country . #% The second problem is that the picture is constantly changing . #% . Mr President , I hope the Commissioner has finished texting everybody to say that they have got the tyre manufacturers sorted out . #% I regret to inform the House , as rapporteur on this item , that I have yet to see any of these documents . #% We had an orchestra , we had the anthem , we had a choir ; we started today , did we not , with the anthem . #% The answer is `` nothing '' because there is nothing that can justify your agenda to control the political life of the nations of Europe by stealth , aided and abetted by the Heads of Government of Member States , not least the United Kingdom . #% Meanwhile , in the short term , women are the key to progress . #% Nowhere could that be more apparent than in your recent proposal for a direct tax to be levied by the European institutions on the peoples of this continent . #% 
We in the ALDE Group will support our own amendments , of course , but not other amendments that seek to weaken this report further . #% This is misleading , and we have to be very careful when using the ` friendly ' label . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner to go back to the original question from Mr Teverson - the first part . #% Mr President , now I know at last how European laws are really made . #% We have an election for a prime minister which will be crucial in relation to the future of the peace process so we must take care not to be seen as interventionist or interfering . #% I would say to the Commission that they must think long and hard before they reject any of the Ombudsman 's findings . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , this is a particularly important report . #% I hope that in some way , this money can work towards the reconstruction not only of buildings but also the communities which were destroyed . #% We do not want to over-complicate it . #% What happens if the Council is adamant and rejects the Commission 's proposals ? #% It says that we should consult before legislating , negotiate before litigating , compensate before retaliating and comply at any rate . #% He specifically referred to the 20 million unemployed , because they are indeed a constant reminder of the biggest social injustice of all . #% As regards the area of the environment , the most important outstanding measure of course is the Lienemann report and the conciliation on LIFE and we are optimistic that we will get a reasonable result there . #% I am very happy with where we have come on third country access : we have managed to keep markets open and to allow EU investors to continue to invest in non-EU funds . #% On the Palestinian side , the danger is that intransigence will be fuelled by events such as the UN racism conference in South Africa , through the influence of radical Arab forces in the region and by the breakdown of liaison between Israeli and Palestinian security agencies . #% This directive will rectify this serious omission . #% Last night it only lasted just over thirty five minutes . #% In Britain a number of people engage in headshaking about what they see as the over-slow progress in modernisation and reform in a number of continental European countries . #% My group would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report , even though , on some compromises , I think all of us could feel the eggshells cracking as we moved towards agreement . #% We must defend freedom of the press , the rights and freedoms of the child , the rights and freedoms of homosexuals , of minorities , the rights of women , ethnic minorities , the rights of refugees , and , yes , unfashionably , those seeking asylum . #% There is also a rumour circulating that a number of Members has asked for unused furniture to be removed from their rooms . #% These days we can not easily accept death when better health and prosperity seem to have brought us so near to immortality . #% I would like to know how the Commission views the situation . #% Pakistan is such a country . #% That is why we need this report to succeed and we should underline any significant achievements and support them where they occur . #% This is an instrument of internal market and competitiveness policy . #% We said we could not give our support then , due to the inclusion of primary law and the lack of the possibility of national tax . #% Here , Mr Wynn is proposing to Parliament that we should not give an opinion . #% Mr President , perhaps it is appropriate that I have the last word in this debate before the Commission . #% I broadly welcome this as a pragmatic proposal . #% Why is that not in here if we are serious about the Council saying to us in this document that it has come up with a practicable solution with a high level of safety and user-friendliness . #% My party will continue to oppose tax harmonisation . #% It is a welcome clarification on where Parliament stands on digital and audiovisual sector issues for the forthcoming revision of TV without frontiers . #% According to the Global Education Campaign , the targets on education would require USD 8 billion a year . #% Secondly , is it not the time for European rhetoric on a European defence identity to have some actuality and for us to start to take more responsibility ourselves for the Bosnian peace process in the long term ? #% This is a very difficult subject firstly because it is difficult to examine in detail the structural funds in any of the Member States . #% More importantly , the enormous insecurity which the Caribbean producers feel at this time demands a speedy response and a response which gives the proper priority to this issue . #% Indeed , the final standard - the full interactive standard - for MHPs has not even been published , and yet colleagues here want to rush ahead and standardise it . #% Capital outflow is now about USD 25 billion a year and yet foreign investment is less than USD 3 billion and falling . #% A number of associations have applied for legal status and have been refused , for example the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia . #% How are we supposed to explain in Prague that the European Parliament is in danger of taking apart the Oostlander report because of an argument with the services of Parliament over the timing of this debate relative to the Committee on Budgets ' hearing on the financial aspects of enlargement ? #% Together with the Quartet it must put forward concrete proposals about what it plans to do to help bring about that settled and peaceful resolution . #% Therefore , I think it needs that coordinated approach . #% Rather , we need a wider investigation that looks at causes rather than symptoms ; an investigation that looks at protecting democracy at home and abroad that looks at how we can fight terrorism protect human rights . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the OSCE plays an important and growing role in promoting peace and stability on our continent of Europe . #% Perhaps the rather delicious irony is that , for the first time ever in this House , the UK Independence Party will be with the majority . #% It has been claimed that much of the argumentation is not evidence-based . #% Once this law becomes enforceable , it should act as a real deterrent . #% In fact I described his report yesterday as courageous . #% It is quite clear to my mind and to others in this Parliament that when we choose to reject what is occurring in terms of the deals which are being struck in Europe 's name , when we are speaking for the people , our views should be respected and people should be brought to understand that in that respect , and that respect alone , we can not renege on the issues which Parliament discusses and puts before you , Sir Leon . #% But as Europeans we must make a sober assessment of what this will mean for us if it were to happen and still more if it were to happen without the United States . #% Today we had the G8 's very weak statement on trade and reform . #% One test of the Commission - I think Mr Liikanen was disingenuous in what he said this morning - is whether there is a genuine openness to alternatives . #% In the light of these failures , it is clear that the EU should put pressure on the UN Secretary-General to prepare a genuinely independent assessment . #% Some recognition must also be given to Uzbekistan and President Karimov 's recent undertakings that there have admittedly been excesses in his country in the fight against Islamist terrorists , but he now wishes to free up the press , establish an independent judiciary and abolish the death penalty . #% In that connection , I want to make two other points . #% We need to look at the way we define the circumstances in which specific documents can be classified completely , or in part , as confidential . #% I believe that these measures are damaging and unnecessary in themselves , and in any case I am opposed in principle to taxes being set at the European level . #% So she said : ` do not stop it ; do make sure , however , that if there are to be implants , they are safe . ' #% The issue of fair compensation , and I speak for the British Labour members , poses a problem for the United Kingdom . #% Otherwise it is unclear to citizens . #% Most of the retrospective elements in the proposal at first reading have now been removed and I can broadly support the Commission 's proposals at second reading , albeit with a few riders . #% However , as the rapporteur , I have some concerns . #% Mr President , all the institutions face a major challenge with enlargement bringing in more members to each institution , but none more so than the Council . #% But we are still open to dialogue with the rapporteur on this because we know what an excellent job he has done . #% in writing . - The European Parliament has no role or responsibility to implement the Lisbon Treaty . #% 
We must also press very strongly for the referendum which is being talked about to go ahead to provide the people of East Timor with the right of self-determination . #% To take up some specific points in the report , first of all on the inclusion of beneficiaries of subsidiary protection . #% British pig farmers have additional problems brought about by the unilateral adoption of stock-rearing rules . #% Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner three questions . #% In some ways I wish that we had gone down the same route as the Germans and the Austrians which was not to process this material on farm , but to put in state-of-the-art multi-million pound installations which were run with typical German efficiency . #% Once a partnership is recognised under a Member State 's recognition of partnership arrangements , we will give equal rights to everybody regardless of the benefit level applied under national legislation in the national context . #% I also agree with the Commission 's overall aspiration to abolish concentration rules and open up the business of executing share trades to competition between exchanges , between MTFs and between the internal execution platforms of investment firms . #% But to say all this must not lead us to be complacent . #% Until we do , this report will primarily be about resisting change and promoting the power of the trade unions to deal with it . #% That is not only the view of the Green/EFA Group , but also of the vast majority of NGOs from both north and south , and of many of the southern representatives there as well . #% Mrs Green referred to ' a potential successor ' , not to the President-elect . #% I also noted that one of the proposals is that we reform the Agriculture Committee and go for codecision . #% Does the Commissioner think the amendments on Article 2 ( 2 ) ( c ) that were adopted by the Environment Committee ensure that privatised companies which supply gas , electricity , water and so on will still be under the obligation to supply this information ? #% I must reflect a rather negative position from that committee : in June 2005 you will recall that this Hemicycle was encircled by a ` Make Poverty History ' band . #% Mr President , I too am grateful to the Council and Commission for being back here promptly for this debate which has overrun . #% Mr President , I was part of the observer mission that went to Zimbabwe , as was Mr Gahler and others here . #% Since when has the European Union initiated anything that improves trade , minimises costs , cuts red tape , generates new wealth , creates new jobs , frees up enterprise ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I fought hard to prevent the premature closure of Units 3 and 4 of Kozloduy . #% That is why the policy on small and medium-sized enterprises on industry policy , on competition and on the internal market must be brought together in a clearer focus . #% Perhaps we could devote more of our committee time to these issues rather than examining fresh legislation . #% I agree with the rapporteur that job creation is a major challenge . #% Our argument that proportional representation should be obligatory in every Member State is accepted . #% It would be far more satisfactory for all of us to be engaged in that debate . #% A survey by the Royal Yachting Association reveals that 54 % of boaters ` would or may ' be forced to give up boating due to the sudden price rise . #% However , although I clearly understand that individual Commissioners do not always get what they want when they want it , I am very disappointed with the way the issue of working time has been handled by the Commission as a whole . #% I know that my constituents , as all the colleagues here , share those views . #% Similarly , attempts to implement safety-engineered medical devices only in certain areas or on certain patients would be neither practical nor effective . #% This is only made worse by the attitude of the Bulgarian authorities towards the rights of minorities or judgments of the European Court of Human Rights . #% I urge the Bulgarian authorities to take very seriously the need to deliver on reform . #% Madam President , despite the threat of a no-confidence motion , I hope that the Commissioner will not cancel her airline tickets to Moscow . #% But we have to keep to our principles here : firstly , we have to keep the contact group together and on board ; we have to make sure there is full solidarity between EU Member States - any weakening by any one of the Member States will undermine the push for a final agreement ; we have to recognise again that what we are talking about is autonomy for Kosovo while respecting the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . #% I agree absolutely with the principles within Mr Santini 's report , but we have to be realistic on a consultation process on how to achieve those principles . #% I also want to pick up on what Mr Hammerstein-Mintz said , that small enterprises are the ones we need to look at in particular . #% Worst of all , an Iranian foundation has stepped up the reward offered for implementing an illegal death threat against Salman Rushdie who is not now and never has been an Iranian citizen . #% Mr President , Mrs Sierra González has tackled a variety of complex issues in her report . #% Lobbying has been intensive and persuasive over this issue . #% There will be critics in the UK of this money being paid to German and Lithuanian workers . #% But there has to be a limit somewhere . #% This is a very bad precedent for the European Commissioner , given that he is about to write a White Paper on a food safety agency . #% I would say to other parliamentarians that we must not think of fishing as being marginal ; what we are talking about here is the wider marine ecology . #% In the fight against fraud we have to accept that the European citizens will not trust us with greater resources until we can demonstrate that we use the existing resources with effectiveness and efficiency . #% In the European Union there is idealism born out of a desire to see a Europe of peace and prosperity , an objective we can all share . #% As a result of that meeting there is clearly a need to coordinate that EU action to complete the EU internal market and remove trade barriers to the creation of the home markets for satellite communications , in particular in the manufacturing sector , and also in the services sector . #% Mr President , a year has now passed since the tragic 9/11 events which triggered the war against Afghanistan , now mercifully in a mopping-up phase to search out and destroy remnants of the odious Taliban regime and their al-Qa ` ida terrorist allies . #% In my view , COP IV was a moderate success dragged screaming from the jaws of what might have been a negotiators ' deadlock . #% In this context , however , the Commission had assumed statutory responsibility for dictating the nature of planning undertaken by Member States - the so-called contingency planning . #% Cardiff is a marvellous opportunity to accept the process of monetary union and to begin the important and essential job of economic reform . #% In contrast , Venezuela is led by a populist demagogue , Hugo Chávez , who has shown scant regard for democracy and freedom of expression . #% In addition , I have specific objections to aspects of the report dealing with EU defence . #% Given their importance , it is vital that we all move together . #% There is new scientific evidence to suggest that public health is much affected by this . #% The Italian presidency , mainly under pressure from Prime Minister Blair , unfortunately retreated in several ways from the Convention 's modest and balanced proposals to extend the scope of QMV and codecision with the Parliament . #% A failure to do so will provoke a serious crisis in our relations with Turkey . #% I think it is now 21 years since this matter was raised by one of my former colleagues , Hugh McMahon , as well as Mr De Rossa . #% We share the grief of the civilian victims and their families and we share the values of our great ally - democracy and individual freedom . #% We can not have a pro-vaccination policy unless we have public acceptance of it , which goes with that greatly changed consumer standpoint . #% I am interested in Chapter 6 on administration . #% Mrs Díez González ' report reminds us that we have agreements with human rights and democracy clauses yet we do nothing . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , we very much appreciate the work of both Mr Fava in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and Ms Bauer in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% That is being assessed with a view to putting the matter into law at as early a date as possible . #% I thank the Commissioner for his reply which is fairly comprehensive . #% I wonder if can we be assured that the Council of Ministers will look very carefully at this and be sure that it does not pose any threat to the development of digital radio in Europe . #% I have high hopes for REACH . #% I guess he is a little embarrassed by having to come at this late stage once again here today . #% Time allocated for debates on these matters is already ridiculously short , and scrutiny is therefore minimal . #% He assured me that it would be completed by 2006 . #% 
I know this has been touched on , but Stoke City in my constituency has an academy club as good as Manchester United and my fear is that it will get less money because it is not in the premier league . #% A poor or developing country can not sustain a birth rate above two children per woman . #% Licences issued for mobile telephone networks need to be creative of user-friendly systems . #% It is another form of co-decision , except that here we were not responding to proposals that came to us from the Commission or the Council but taking a view because of the absence of such proposals at an earlier stage . #% I have written to the Commissioner on this subject and would still like to ask him why it is that we have offered such support to the transitional government in Somalia and why we are not asking serious questions about the bloody process which we are apparently continuing in many ways to tolerate . #% The 1951 Geneva Convention was surely never intended to give protection to terrorists ; it is therefore right that they should be excluded . #% Therefore I think we should welcome the fact that , in the social partners ' agreement , clause 11 talks about the duty to report under a no-blame culture . #% The rights of the Chechens , of whom 200 000 are living in direct danger and fear , are being ignored by the Russians . #% Playing the system , breaking the spirit of the rules . #% Yet Parliament persevered and built up this consensus which reopened the Treaties -- a taboo subject for many years . #% I also attended the conciliation meeting just before Christmas , when we hammered out the new legal base . #% We are also very pleased that the amendment widening the definition of the family went through . #% At a time when many citizens are showing signs of losing faith in the European Union this is a very clear example of how we can demonstrate that there really is something in Europe for every man , woman and child who lives in it . #% However , I am very clear that the introduction of an FTT at EU level , if not also implemented globally , raises potential risks to the UK 's competitive position as a financial centre , which has a clear impact on citizens in South-East England . #% I know that Mr Casaca , with his interest in these matters , and probably Mr Mulder , will want to examine that . #% I have written to him concerning a possible scam that is appearing in various EU countries . #% In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative , it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular : physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility , visual information systems which exclude blind workers , working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems . #% I would like to also draw attention to the need that Stephen Hughes talked about of giving drivers an appropriate length of time before they take out a load . #% Madam President , during the debate on the Anastassopoulos report earlier this week , many Members said that we must make every effort to bring this Parliament closer to the people of Europe . #% There were those who are not here tonight -- including Mr Hannan from the PPE-DE Group -- who said that this was going to finance only pro-European parties , as if there were a rule that we could bias the funding towards a particular political viewpoint . #% Our group did that and we will not suspend judgment on any of these candidates simply because of the historic importance of this moment . #% We salute him for that . #% We must not think these directives and regulations are the end of the process . #% Supposedly we , the democratic check of the European Union , the pillar of the budgetary authority , have had the wool pulled over our eyes in what is essentially a simple rent scam . #% Firstly I would like to join in the warm congratulations to Commissioner Lamy and indeed his distinguished predecessor Sir Leon , now Lord , Brittan . #% Perhaps , rather than rejecting the criticism , the Commissioner should reflect on why - if it is true - it might be that NGOs are saying something slightly different to him than they are saying to this Parliament . #% We do not see these as contradictory but rather as establishing a limit beyond which we do not wish to go . #% However , we are pleased today that both French MEPs and British Labour MEPs have pushed for a debate , and indeed that the ELDR Group has joined us in calling this debate this afternoon . #% There have been questions about political influence being used for appointments to statutory advisory bodies such as the housing authority . #% All who value civil liberties , rural values and animal welfare should speak out against this unjust and oppressive measure . #% The draft declaration agreed by Parliament and the Council includes , in its Paragraph 1 , a means of derogating from the Treaty , which I hope will safeguard Parliament 's rights . #% They are not in jeopardy . #% There is double speak here , with EU control overturning principle . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , Moldova is Europe 's poorest country and is also landlocked , but has recently had a successful democratic election . #% Never have I received so many communications from ordinary people asking me to reject it . #% We then went further , and I agreed to put an oral amendment stating it should be `` adequate defence expenditure '' . #% It is important to keep some distinction between the roles the different institutions can play in promoting human rights and democratisation . #% As Mr Barrot said , we have to recognise transport 's clear contribution and the need for the ` greening ' of transport . #% In conclusion , although this is a small measure to many and will not mean much to those countries where animals routinely cross internal EU borders , for those who cherish pets as lifelong companions it is a measure that will be greatly welcomed . #% Indeed in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , of which I am also a member , we will shortly be considering a report on that subject . #% National regulators will have a vital role to play in enforcing the guidelines at Member State level , as envisaged by the Gas Directive . #% In these circumstances it was no longer credible to support a motion against the whole Commission and our delegation policy was therefore to abstain . #% Indeed we intend doing so because , although we have a recommendation , within it we have a revision clause which will mean that the Commission comes back to Parliament within the lifetime of this Parliament - I think I am right in saying in 2003 - in order that we can try to assess how the Member States are performing in relation to this particular recommendation . #% For example , the chapter on racism , xenophobia and non-discrimination includes information on an EIDHR project to combat discrimination against Dalits in Nepal . #% We agree with Ms Saïfi 's suggestion that a world environment organisation be formed and that the ILO status should be strengthened . #% We understand that Mr Gargani , as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , has sent a letter this morning to the President stating that committee has concerns about legal administrative questions . #% The Group of the European People 's Party continues to have reservations about this idea . #% Regrettably , however , the Commission 's proposal for a Council decision fails to mention the role that women entrepreneurs might have in this process . #% But what I would now like to do is make an appeal as a citizen . #% I apologise in advance for having to leave early : I think I have caught a Strasbourg cold . #% The Commission is , once again , being profligate and irresponsible with other people 's money and this is why we will not be supporting either proposal . #% The programme is founded on the assumption of cooperation . #% It is perhaps worth recording that not a single fatality was reported as a result of this extraordinary incident . #% I regret that the Council of Ministers insisted on charter flights being included . #% Mr President , I wish to raise a point under Rule 151 ( 3 ) of the Rules of Procedure . #% Madam President , I should like on behalf of my group to congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for his two excellent reports . #% I agree with what Mrs Fontaine has said about the attention to detail . #% Mr President , this is a truly distressing affair . #% But , for instance , elements of the Pakistani ISA have long been suspected of granting tacit support to the Afghan Taliban and are only now reluctantly realising the domestic dangers of such an approach . #% This will enable the EU to react quickly to crises and will allow unforeseen needs to be financed . #% Europe 's policy should serve as an example to the US and others as to how to proceed in future . #% We must insist that measures be put in place by the Afghan authorities and the international community , including the European Union , to ensure the proper management , accounting and use of these funds . #% Last autumn , following the first session back after the summer , I was very ill for some four weeks , culminating in a week in hospital . #% We can not afford to close our eyes to the reality . #% Mr President , there have been two early casualties of REACH , the first of which is truth . #% I hope that most Members in this House will agree with me that we should be moving towards a visa-free Europe , a Europe without barriers , at ease with itself and the rest of the world . #% 
The latest Council guidelines on MEP involvement , decided on a week before Buenos Aires , are positively insulting to Parliament . #% Mr President , legislation which seeks to protect the public from a terrible brain disease such as new variant CJD should be drafted to complement measures already in place in Member States , to recognise the stage of the epidemic that we are at and have due regard to the body of scientific knowledge we have built up . #% The situation in several Latin American countries is also precarious . #% There are other areas . #% We have already heard dangerously loose talk about the need for more European economic governance . #% The delegation for relations with the US is planning , as you probably know , a transatlantic legislators ' dialogue using video-conferencing techniques so that we can discuss and understand - and clearly the Americans need to understand - what the powers of this Parliament are , the positive powers and also the negative powers and also the importance of timing in our joint negotiations . #% It is clear that this Constitution has very broad support across the political spectrum and across Member States . #% One of the points I made when we had a debate on this issue , Commissioner , was that I felt that parliamentarians need to be much better engaged in the process . #% It is very important that we get it through today . #% The second concern is the dominance of the AKP in the political landscape , which leads some observers to fear the gradual development of a de facto one-party state . #% I have faith in our new food safety measures . #% As a result , there are few training places available for EU junior officers and ratings and , sadly , redundancy is being offered to many in this industry in the EU . #% Instead , with respect to the few diligent souls still left in the Public Gallery at this hour , I would like to illustrate in a way that is particularly relevant to Members why we need to make some real progress both tonight and in the coming weeks to create a meaningful European network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases . #% I believe that MEPs , as the only directly elected representatives in the EU , should be involved in shaping the next financial perspective in order to achieve the best deal for UK citizens . #% Mr President , the key and emotive issue regarding this debate and this directive is how to protect the health of children and adults while ensuring the phasing out of animal testing within a reasonable timescale . #% Muhammad Abbas 's ruling Fatah faction would also be hard pushed to meet our level of legitimacy with the legacy of cronyism and corruption . #% I am also delighted that we have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission in pre-conciliation to get this important package through at first reading . #% I also regret that we did not strengthen our calls for the demilitarisation of the region . #% I therefore had no alternative but to support this motion of censure and I am proud to have done so . #% If I am angry -- and people like me are angry -- over Iraq and now Lebanon , what sort of ammunition does it give to people intent on the indoctrination of alienated young Muslims ? #% We want to develop a common platform for Europe 's engineers , but the one point on which I differ with the rapporteur is that his report seeks to impose a separate regime for engineers , devised from one particular point of view . #% I would like to ask , in this instance , that all other groups in the House support that amendment , which is designed to ensure that where a partner to a financial transaction goes bankrupt , the consumer does not suffer any loss as a result . #% Right from the beginning , I argued that it would create uncertainty and simply cause new demands for exemptions and exceptions . #% I am glad the Committee on Budgetary Control approved discharge last week , albeit by a small margin . #% I support calls to set up a special Consumer Ombudsman for the extra-judicial settlement of disputes and believe that more effective cross-border cooperation mechanisms will help to improve protection for consumers across the EU . #% Your simplistic exclusions of data processing exclude signal processing and digital technology . #% I think this House brings itself into disrepute by working in this way and I deeply regret it . #% That is why we firmly reject the British proposals to insert a third legislative chamber composed of national MPs , whose function would be `` to police subsidiarity '' . #% We are looking at outcomes . #% If Commissioner Kinnock is asking me if I believe that the European Commission could actually help grassroots football better than the multinational corporations who actually rely on the profits , I would actually vote for the European Commission . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , those were interesting remarks , but I am afraid they have very little to do with the contents of my report . #% If there are to be reduced profits for the pharmaceuticals , my country , the UK , will suffer disproportionately , as it is a major employer and export-earner , and many of our pension funds are heavily invested in this sector . #% One could say in its favour that unlike some of its neighbours it remains free of inter-ethnic strife . #% Culture funding is too small -- that has been said before . #% To move from a Union of 15 Member States -- soon to be 25 -- to a single state with legal entity , whose laws will have primacy over the laws of those Member States , is a development which my party -- the UK Independence Party -- believes should not be concluded without the express will of the population by a referendum . #% I should also remind you that many of the problems in Kaliningrad are of Russia 's own making , not least the refusal to allow many countries to set up consulates there . #% If so , I think we will be disappointed . #% But it does not yet cover workers in other professions at risk , so we hope Member States could look at that . #% The Commissioner briefly mentioned one issue that is particularly important : counterfeiting and fraud . #% Member States may have signed up to commitments not to actively recruit health workers from the poorest nations , but in practice they are finding ways round those promises . #% The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood . #% I hope that the Minister will put this on the agenda of the Environment Council on 23 October . #% When we started to look at this proposal we had to bear in mind that it came out of the original discussions on the control of VOC emissions from some years ago when we first looked at the problem : the emission of VOCs from large industrial plants , from large garages , from large petrol stations and so forth . #% I appreciate the proposals in the report which would enable the views of NGOs to be heard far more systematically in the JPA 's proceedings . #% Fortunately , Mr Langen is well aware of the limits of such an approach which could place costs at up to ten times higher in a bourse than elsewhere . #% This fund was established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement , which was not a treaty as suggested in the explanatory statement , with the objectives of promoting economic and social advance , while encouraging dialogue and reconciliation between the two communities of Northern Ireland . #% There are some things that can and should be done at a European level . #% Mr President , I should like to propose , in agreement with Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra , who is the author of this amendment , and being aware that the Socialist Group also has a similar oral amendment , that at the end , after the words ` trafficking in drugs , arms and human beings ' , it should read : ` and financing through extortion , including the so-called revolutionary tax ' . #% My report is very clear on this . #% What we must try to get out of these negotiations is clearly an agreement that works and will be enforceable . #% The future of our social economic model with the special summit at Hampton Court is part of that context . #% Firstly , we can not support specific amendments which single out maritime fisheries or urban areas for special priority , whatever our personal sympathies , because this represents a balanced package in which no one special interest can be advocated above any other . #% Since that date the Commission has convened a meeting of the group of experts established under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty to give an opinion on the possible health consequences of the use of depleted uranium . #% Some acts of savagery are doubly chilling because they are authorised by people supposedly appointed to administer justice . #% Referring to what Mr Kirkhope said , this is an issue of great importance and I could not agree with him more . #% Mr President , I am keen that we finish this debate . #% The Commission knows what we want and we can act fairly and effectively and as quickly as possible when we get that proposal . #% Mr President , as Parliament 's rapporteur for a single market strategy , it is important to emphasise that the operation of an effective , open and competitive public procurement process is an absolutely indispensable foundation of a working internal market . #% All in all , he was a frustrating friend for those of us who wanted to move further and faster . #% It is disingenuous to try to claim that it is not an agreement . #% I do think , however , that we are near the beginning of the end rather than the end of the beginning . #% Second , I welcome news that production of the Audi A1 might move to the Forest plant to save some jobs , but the workforce has already been warned that such a move must involve a drop in labour costs . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights recommends that the use of pseudonyms should be investigated and monitored . #% The issue is : who should decide ? #% We are there to ensure an effective registration process , to rigorously monitor the vote , and to give all political parties access to the media . #% So we are pleased to have been able to breathe a little more life into this body . #% 
As you can imagine this caused consternation in the House . #% The inclusion of supply-chain responsibility for us is crucial . #% In my own region we have the beginnings of a successful bio-diesel industry in the Tees Valley . #% For that purpose , we withheld money in the reserve at first reading , so that we could have a proper negotiation with the Council on second reading . #% We might also then develop a culture where your paid and unpaid work , your pay packet , your parental leave and your pension are not determined by your sex . #% They have no interest in cloning humans : rather what they are interested in is being able to work on human tissue to help find remedies for , for example , Alzheimer ' s Disease and leukaemia and what they are doing breaks no law in the United Kingdom . #% May I say how much I believe the voice of Parliament is strengthened by the ability of four groups to agree on the resolution put forward today . #% What happened last time showed that it worked well and we are not asking for a right of censure on individual Commissioners . #% But I see this as a useful opportunity , if we can take that approach , to adjust the directive in the light of experience . #% Finally and importantly , I want to reiterate that everything that has been conducted , or will be conducted , is in complete conformity with United Kingdom law , with United States law and , most importantly , is done with complete respect for , and in complete conformity with , the European Convention on Human Rights . #% Action in this field must be an absolute priority . #% So it is in order for people who have been members of other EU institutions to express an opinion in their present position . #% However , since 1994 we have all at last seen both words and action from the Commission - action this Parliament has welcomed and I believe , as rapporteur , sought at every turn to facilitate . #% I am afraid we have always been slow , we have always been behind the average and we are going to have to do an awful lot of very hard work in terms of building infrastructure and putting a whole range of measures in place to ensure that we achieve the objectives that we have set down in this legislation . #% There is huge concern about the balance between security and civil liberties being tipped too far towards security in the United States . #% This was recognised in 1972 , when the Robens Committee Inquiry on health and safety in the UK , addressing the dynamic of excessive resort to law-making and its effect on enforcement , observed : '' ... the sheer mass of this law , far from advancing the cause of safety and health , may well have reached the point where it becomes counter-productive . '' #% What that summit in Lisbon represented was a giant deceit and an attempt to impose upon the peoples of Europe a constitution just by dropping that word and repackaging it , when it actually has all the same proposals . #% Even the so-called depressed north-east of the country has a skyline littered with cranes that shows a level of economic activity that would be impressive anywhere in the world . #% But we must make sure that photographs of naked children are caught in that net . #% I hope , Commissioner , that you will be able to take on that task , but I warmly welcome this new programme for the future of SMEs in the European Union . #% Some of the changes may be unhelpful . #% This approach is malicious and counter-productive . #% We need a broad round , we need comprehensive negotiations to get a package that has something in it for everybody . #% In future , what we need is a more focused and concentrated approach on coordinated priorities for funding , cross-border projects or major items of Community interest - the rest should be left to the Member States . #% It is very much a sensitive matter and totally unnecessary . #% In the case of the United Kingdom , that stopped in 1988 . #% When we get an agreement that sticks , we can then start to focus properly on the sorts of issues which concern the citizens of a Europe of 25 Member States . #% In July , the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission unanimously issued a strong statement of concern about intense underwater noise , citing what calls compelling evidence that entire populations of whales and other marine mammals are potentially threatened by it . #% With all due respect for the rapporteur , I have to say that we also have a problem with a number of areas that she has not dealt with , one of which is the issue of football hooliganism . #% Cordless power tools have made building sites much safer and often in the case of power failure we rely on batteries for back-up lighting or emergency power . #% If the money is not available and that is why these FVO missions have been postponed - tell us so . #% They do not have to adhere to the same rules . #% I support the rapporteur and his efforts to increase new funding . #% Today the judgement is already becoming clear , because what we have on the agenda is more red tape , not less : we have a directive that calls for businesses to record how much the sun is shining . #% Therefore , the EPLP has abstained from the final vote . #% It is not the fault of Mr Schnellhardt that there has been a woeful refusal to see that common policies on labelling require common procedures . #% We then had a series of supplementary questions and it is the latter I was speaking about when I said that they were not answered . #% At that time , the Commission 's reply to Parliament related to the specific issue of the test-firing of shells in coastal waters , and it offered the view that such action would not have a significant impact on the environment . #% Only today it has announced that it can not compete in the sports field , because enormous financial resources are now being deployed to take away those staples of the mass audience which the BBC needs in order to preserve its own diversity and , indeed , its own audience . #% The knock-on effects could seriously damage the 30 000 people employed in the boat industry , the 70 000 people whose jobs are supported by marine tourism and the GBP 700 million spent by boaters every year . #% We have tabled amendments to throw out the common position completely , to remove all references to natural sunlight and to get some sense back into this directive . #% A bad situation is now a desperate situation , with properties actually being sold as we speak . #% The Euro-rabid Tories - the ones led by William Hague , that is - would have us believe that the EU brings us nothing but bureaucracy and interference . #% We could even pay for three Eurofighters a year , if they ever reach squadron service . #% I pick out arbitrarily an amendment which says that there was no evidence of health or environmental problems arising from some of the burial sites in the south-west . #% Some system must be found to ensure that all vessels sailing under a particular national flag are made accountable to the courts of that state , and the Member State of which the captain and crew are nationals must cooperate in ensuring that this blatant flouting of conservation measures is stopped . #% in writing . - Clearly , while the summit in Copenhagen was seen as disappointing in its final outcomes , there is much to commend further efforts . #% I guess I am not going to get any clearer statement other than `` as quickly as possible '' . #% There is nothing in the Treaties that says that must happen . #% First of all , will the Court of Auditors accept that the threat to own resources shown in the annual report can not be tackled at Community level alone ? #% It has not been easy to come forward with this proposal . #% If we handle this process properly the European Union will become a genuinely wide European Union , not simply a Western European Union . #% Such a scheme would merely encourage more refugees , genuine or not , to come to the European Union . #% But anyone who denies the existence of this political agenda - which subsumes the single currency - in my view is either deluded or dishonest , because it is a very real agenda . #% That is what we should be aiming for on 1 May . #% Iran must stay out of Iraqi affairs . #% That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment , so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account , and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment . #% paragraph 18 - Israel has not declared that it possesses nuclear weapons and therefore it is in appropriate to include Israel in this context ; #% Our emphasis is on saying that the industry should spend a little less on marketing and a lot more on developing alternative testing methods . #% A number of papers have been circulated to Members before this particular debate , and I would just like to highlight one from the rapporteur where he says that the only beneficiaries of the entry into force of the text proposed by the Council will be the chocolate multinationals . #% It might be a minor subject , but it is very important to those involved in the recreational boating industry and those many thousands of people across Europe who also indulge their hobby of boating . #% I will bring the matter to the attention of the relevant Commissioner and make the point that you have addressed . #% The KGB -- now the FSB -- is central for the institutionalised web of organised crime and corruption that dominates Russia . #% We can not , on the one hand , say that the containment is too drastic because of the slaughter policy and , on the other hand , that it is too slack because it has let the disease take hold . #% The tragic truth is this : if Hamas continues to bomb , to kill , to maim and now to kidnap , then Israel will respond . #% Can we ask for actions on these issues , now that the crisis has at least lifted a little , in order to get a more permanent settlement , which will be in the interests not only of people outside but also of the Iraqi people ? #% 
We must look at the signing of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention by North Korea and outstanding problems around the issue of abductees from Japan . #% Not only will the euro generate more jobs , it will bring transparency to wages and salaries , which in turn will be improved . #% The Commission will then consider appropriate action to be taken in the light of the scientific evidence produced by these activities . #% Mr President , the European Summit in Brussels last week gave a mandate to the Irish presidency to complete the negotiations for the Constitutional Treaty by the next summit on 17 June . #% We live in an era of massive capital flows and foreign exchange markets . #% We agree with the rapporteur ' s intention to stiffen and speed up the compliance provisions in Amendments Nos 42 and 43 . #% It makes sense , then , that all the work that has gone into establishing those systems does not go to waste and that we do not create unnecessary extra administrative burdens ; that is far from being our intention . #% We must not just hold the Commission to account for the progress of these reforms , but also look at our own management policies within this institution . #% The uneven distribution of the benefits of globalisation has left nearly four million people living on less than one dollar per day . #% We need to establish what needs debate because we disagree and because we need to explore further the issues involved , and what can be dealt with under a simplified procedure because we all agree . #% I for one would feel it wrong for this House to try to look at this matter in a hurry , which seems to be the proposal being put forward by Mr Barón Crespo . #% I wish to turn to the proposals on accidents and injuries which I believe could offer the furthest-reaching impact on the lives of ordinary citizens . #% Because of the excellent work of Mr Sterckx and by way of a compromise , we can now drop that demand in favour of a request to the Conference of Presidents for a temporary committee to carry on the work of Mr Sterckx and to find the answers to the questions that he and others have posed . #% The dioxin story is very familiar to those of us in the United Kingdom who have lived through BSE . #% It is currently controlled only by a patchwork of national laws . #% I should like to ask a related question regarding the banning of Staffordshire terriers in Germany under their dangerous dogs law . #% Firstly , there is a need to raise awareness of the prevalence of violence against women in every country , every city and amongst all social classes . #% I congratulate them for their skill . #% Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project , which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire , to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex . #% I welcome what Commissioner Liikanen has said , but I want to see more rapid progress . #% So we do not need a European PNR system : we will get it by the back door . #% In some ways the most interesting challenge posed by these relatively new forms of crime are the means of countering them . #% Mr President , we certainly welcome this further legislation , which is absolutely essential for the safety of passengers for whom this is one of the main forms of travel between Member States . #% It is significant that after much debate in committee only one additional amendment has been tabled over and above those adopted in committee . #% She spoke of contamination of the seas in Ireland and Denmark . #% The possibility of comparing education systems across borders will , I hope , lead to improvements across European teaching establishments as schools learn from others outside their immediate view . #% Do you feel that the decision the Council of Ministers arrived at , whereby some countries are going to start decoupling long before others , has actually weakened the position of the European Union ? #% We need to develop further the technological basis of space activities , in particular launchers , to move eventually to European independence . #% But before I sat down last time I also said I hoped that the Council would make a better job of this than we did . #% It expressly envisages that an international court may be established for that purpose , preferably in the territory in which the crimes were committed and if not , elsewhere . #% Madam President , this concerns the Fiori report which we voted on in Brussels last time . #% After all , the report is the Committee on Budgetary Control 's response to the special report by the Court of Auditors . #% The first point to make is that the Amsterdam Treaty thoroughly enshrines that role by declaring in the new Article 152 that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities . #% Of the 400 000 sufferers in the EU , 85 000 are in my own country , the United Kingdom . #% Firstly , as regards the qualified majority formula , we need to raise the number of states needed to form a majority , while at the same time raising the population threshold needed to form a blocking minority . #% We therefore encourage the Tunisian authorities to continue to improve the framework for elections and to take the necessary steps to ensure that the next elections fully meet international standards . #% Mr President , my only conclusion , as we have heard tonight , is that those who oppose do so because they share the prejudice that disability access is an unnecessary technical detail . #% Average finds for the same offence also vary considerably between Member States : for example , for keeping prohibited fishing gear on board , between EUR 451 and EUR 9 000 ; for unauthorised fishing , between EUR 375 and EUR 8 379 , and for falsifying data , between EUR 98 and EUR 132 056 . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Ford and Mr Dell ` Alba for finding such obscure articles in the Rules of Procedure that they have actually not been implemented for so long , and then to propose deleting them , but as Mr Ford has already pointed out there is a snag . #% Mr President , British Conservatives believe that the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports has worked well as a politically binding instrument since it came into being in 1998 , but there is scope for some improvement and refinement . #% Of the six named phthalates to be banned as a result , two are used for flooring and cosmetics but not for children 's toys , one is not used at all , one is not made at all , one is not used because of fears it might be carcinogenic ( though on 8 February it was totally cleared by the WHO ) and that leaves one , DINP that is used to soften PVC in chewing rings and so on . #% There seems to be little appreciation amongst American diplomats of the increased powers and influence of MEPs . #% It exposed a poor safety culture and an inadequate secondary control procedure in the manufacture of MOX fuel . #% No assurance company , however large , can afford such sums . #% Ten per cent of the world 's biomedical research funds are dedicated to addressing the problems that are responsible for 90 % of the world 's burden of disease ; that is the imbalance . #% This House has therefore chosen a noble route : not to condemn , nor to cast out those who have been detained -- perhaps in horrific circumstances -- but to ask quite simply that the rule of national or international law be upheld and fully respected . #% How awkward and inconvenient democracy is . #% With the Treaty of Nice , coming so soon after the Treaty of Amsterdam and to be followed by another IGC in 2004 we live in an Age of Permanent Revolution . #% However , it is detergents we are discussing this morning and we should remember , as Mr Florenz reminded us , what that industry is made up of : in particular , in the specialist area - the non-domestic area - some two-thirds of that area is produced by small firms employing some 20 000 people throughout the European Union . #% This does not in any way affect the individual Member States ' procedures , nor is it a measure which tries to be ambitious and look again at the whole issue of asylum procedures as such , or indeed asylum criteria . #% We will scrutinise the treaties with care and attention to detail and no one should take Parliament 's vote for granted . #% We are pledged to restore the economic harmony , security , prosperity and cultural vibrancy of the Baltic region . #% We have seen President Mugabe 's wanton non-compliance with the undertakings given at the Abuja summit on September and only last weekend the snub he delivered to the visiting EU Troika . #% Only last week , as I am sure you are aware , the British development minister announced a very large investment in research for that vaccine . #% Serious cultural problems have emerged inside this Parliament as we have debated the issues involved . #% We must never forget , as we deal with the current economic and financial crisis , that we were facing enormous economic challenges even before the crisis struck , such as the growth of China and the Far East and our increasing energy insecurity . #% It should seek to ring-fence the first and second parts . #% War criminals in future will be able to take comfort from the belief that realpolitik will guarantee their future safety . #% This piece of paper includes provision to make buses more accessible for disabled users , but it does not address the whole question of operating regulations for public transport systems across the European Union . #% I hope that over the next few months and years the Commission will come up with mechanisms of that kind to really put pressure on Member States where it hurts . #% Recently , there have been calls to make these Stability and Growth Pact ceilings more flexible . #% So what assurances can the Commission give us that every possible step will be taken to ensure that our high ambitions here will truly be realised , and that we can all have confidence that these voluntary partnership agreements , as we make them in future , will deliver on the goals we have set ? #% The fact is , as has been referred to in this debate , the preparation of some foodstuffs - as shown , for example , in the Panorama programme - has been quite disgraceful . #% I would firstly like formally to thank Mr Coveney for his approach in dealing with this matter and the way in which he has been open to considering representations made by my colleague Mrs Lynne and myself . #% In a courageous address to his people the Prime Minister of India highlighted other incidents which are not acceptable in a modern , tolerant democracy . #% Mr Adamou quite rightly mentioned Annex I and I am grateful to him for going through all the technical details for something we totally accept and agree with . #% 
They were helped by the early climb-down of the UK Government during both conciliation processes . #% We discovered that the world 's security , stability and economy are much more fragile than we previously believed . #% Mr President , on behalf of my Group , I should like to give a very warm welcome to this report and to thank Mrs Flesch for her very comprehensive and detailed work , which shows her experience in the field . #% I think this is particularly relevant as we have now changed the way in which the work programme of the Commission is formulated so as to have more input from our specialised committees . #% Those six directives specifically excluded the self-employed . #% Nevertheless , I decided against retabling the amendments because I did not have the support of the Committee on Employment or the other groups in this House . #% Does subsidiarity apply here or not ? #% Finally , we have sought to ensure that paragraphs 210 to 230 of the report address the specific instruments to promote human rights that we have as a European Union : the human rights dialogues , the human rights clause in our agreement with third countries , our representations in Geneva and New York , the actions and implementation of the guidelines and the European initiative on democracy and human rights . #% How will the tensions which I have personally observed be overcome - the tensions which always exist on the ground between the UN and the European Union , and how will the new approach which you intend to adopt , facilitate a better partnership and a lessening of those kind of tensions on the ground ? #% Mr President , I welcome this afternoon 's debate , because if ever a process needed fresh political impetus and initiative this one does . #% I hope that the majority of Parliament will support Mr Gauzès , the rapporteur , and the other shadow rapporteurs in the work we have done . #% I wish you a happy Christmas . #% This was only possible for Council committees , not Parliament 's . #% We still need to vote on paragraph 17 . #% In the first instance this requires greater efforts to ensure that funds already promised are spent in a timely and effective manner . #% In 2004 , the United States and the European Union agreed to take constructive joint steps to improve our capabilities in this regard . #% I was the draftsman for the opinion of the International Trade Committee which was adopted unanimously in committee . #% I would hope that in light of the Amsterdam Treaty coming into effect , the Council and the Commission start listening a bit more carefully to Parliament . #% As I indicated in my point of order my reservations are about paragraphs 7 , 9 and 10 and the use in the English text of the words ` European public prosecutor ' , and what I believe to be the misinterpretation and the misuse of Article 280 as it is referred to in indents ( h ) and ( I ) . #% It is also clear that , while responsibility ultimately rests with the European Commission , it is the Member States and the Council - in particular the Council - who need to be far more conscientious in their application of European funding and who need to demonstrate far greater urgency in their efforts to achieve a positive statement of assurance . #% Many of those who have become unemployed in those Member States are the most vulnerable and the least likely to find employment quickly . #% For that reason , we in the Socialist Group will be opposing the paragraphs within the report which call for a harmonized coin for the whole of the European Union and we will support Mrs Peijs ' amendment which calls for national symbols to be possible on these coins . #% I welcome the fact that there were good talks with Kim Chong-il . #% We not only need friends of fishing ; but more importantly , we need friends of fish . #% The website , or the computer , told me that there were no direct flights from London to San Francisco and recommended a connecting flight via New York with , I think , United . #% The world has moved on a little since then . #% That is all we are asking for and that is what we , by way of my Amendment No 1 , hope colleagues will support tomorrow . #% I would say : let us be realistic , rather than too idealistic . #% We think that in an incident you can not differentiate between some cabin crew who may have safety training and others who do not . #% Mr President , many of us in Parliament and in the ACP were rather unhappy with the proposal for a global quota . #% Let us make delivery by Member States our absolute priority . #% I should also like to echo his opening words in relation to Lithuania . #% Only in this way will we save not just the Patagonian toothfish but whatever other species becomes the next fashion at the dinner tables of Tokyo and North America - and even Brussels as well . #% A whole range of non-road mobile machinery -- construction equipment , barges and all sorts of niche equipment we have not yet though about -- is going to be brought sensibly under control , putting an end to a lot of smelly diesel fume emissions in all sorts of strange places that prompt complaints . #% The UK may not have chosen to opt into this measure at the moment , but I am contributing to this debate and participating in it as other British Members are because we want to make certain that we have sound legislation laying down sensible provisions , so that the UK will be able to opt into it in the future . #% We have time to get this directive right because it does not have to be implemented until 1998 . #% The coordination of social security systems has been in place since 1971 - it is not new , as some thought the last time we discussed it - and it is this regulation that will be discussed in the context of the cross-border health-care debate on Thursday morning . #% Second , I suggest that measures should be taken that would allow VAT on mobile phones to be paid directly to the tax authorities so that criminals can not get their hands on the proceeds . #% There are good sentiments in the report ; there are merits in the analysis of the report . #% I believe there needs to be more and better training of Commission staff - both in Brussels and in delegations - particularly in how they manage the participation of children . #% I am in favour of legislation laying down noise limits for specific projects , but we really are going far too far in many aspects of the amendments proposed in this directive . #% The EU institutions have perhaps let down the Greek Cypriots by failing sufficiently to challenge their version of history or to encourage them to realise that a compromise would be necessary -- not a return to the pre-1974 situation . #% The tenth triennial convention covers the period 1999 to 2001 and provides for a contribution of EUR 120.82 million to UNRWA ' s regular education and health programmes . #% I feel that I need to give you some information in light of Mr Dover ' s speech . #% And one of the important things that we did there and that the European Commission did - and I give them credit - was to talk to Chinese manufacturers about designing safety into the product from the beginning : the knowledge of those directives . #% There has to be some way in which we could help people of this kind come up to the standard necessary , or at least present the relevant dossier over the period of time we now have . #% However , the Left has been successful in taking the spotlight off its own extremes and promoting institutions and policies which assist its own objectives . #% As the proposal says , safety is amongst the most important considerations of the Committee on Transport and Tourism . #% Another issue is impunity , which of course we all rightly condemn . #% I would like to ask the Commission to investigate the possibilities for developing share farming within the common agricultural policy . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Brinkhorst for the work we have done together on the SAB . #% However , it is our place to point out human rights violations when we see them . #% The overwhelming hypocrisy of the government of my own country , the UK , and of the US , in demanding that others disarm while they simultaneously upgrade their own nuclear capacity , is completely unacceptable . #% I understand the raison d'être behind that proposal , but I believe that it would prove extremely problematical . #% A lot of the legislation that we adopt in this place does not actually work in the way that it should . #% Either way , retail food prices can only go higher . #% EU funds also helped transform Manchester into a major cultural and tourism centre , by helping build the G Mex Exhibition Centre , the Bridgewater Concert Hall , The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry and the Imperial War Museum ( North ) . #% That is why we must work towards independent living and why it is so important that the employment directive is fully implemented in all Member States . #% In the strong consensus we have achieved in supporting the bulk of the proposals let us remember we will encounter real conflict in delivering on the aims agreed . #% We await with keen anticipation the Commission 's proposals to reduce emissions from the transport sector . #% I realise that I am the servant of the committee and I try to reflect what we have voted . #% That is one area where this legislation has fallen down in the past . #% I commend this measure to the House . #% That is why we support action to include aviation in a global emissions trading scheme . #% Health services across Europe are unable even to fund basics , and face savage cuts as ordinary citizens pay for the bust of globalism . #% This is where most accidents occur in the workplace and yet there is undisguised dismay amongst myself and other colleagues at the fact that we take very little account of this . #% 
Mr President , I should like first to congratulate the United States of America , the puppet masters at this convention . #% However , as a number of colleagues have said -- and this is a time for looking forward rather than backwards , because we have the agreement on the table -- there is a lot of work to do to establish the clear responsibilities with organisations and to ensure through the so-called competent authorities in Member States that companies ' operating processes and anyone involved in potentially environmentally damaging activities are fully aware of their potential responsibilities under this directive . #% Instead of constant self flagellation , hand-ringing and searching for flaws in our own democracies we really must be more effective in correcting the constant and massive abuse of human rights which is the daily lot of people is so many far-flung countries . #% Animal welfare groups are unhappy with the outcome of the negotiations between Parliament and the Council , but I hope they recognise that real progress has been made . #% In its reply to the Ombudsman on the criticism of the management of the infringement case concerning the award of the contract for building the Thessaloniki metro , the Commission has therefore pledged itself to consolidating the administrative rules for complainants in order to facilitate contracts between complainants and Commission departments . #% It is a weak document and gives no clear signal on the best direction for action . #% As we have heard , the open method of coordination is now being used in a wide variety of areas . #% Finally , we added a new principle : the mainstreaming of consumer welfare in EU policy objectives . #% A statement made in the United Kingdom recently made it clear that British farmers were virtually at the bottom of the table for earnings : they were third from the bottom . #% That is not part of this discussion . #% Madam President , I want to raise the case of a British man on death row in Ohio in the United States . #% Parliament also stood out in favour of maintaining a sensible balance between too much detail and that which needs to be regulated . #% This is about the fact that the question tabled by Roy Perry and now by the Committee on Petitions has not been answered properly . #% There was so much frustration in the last Parliament about not being able to get the information we required . #% Shame on them ! #% . Mr President , I should like to add my thanks to Commissioner Wallström for all her work as Environment Commissioner . #% What we discovered was that venture capital was much more available than in Europe , and that those who provided it were much more risk-taking in their approach . #% I am certain that the Council will wish to do the same . #% This is a disappointing result , but , in spite of that , I should like to thank everyone involved . #% If we do not have this information , if we can not evaluate what is going on , how can we decide whether we should renew them when the time comes ? #% There has been no challenge yet and the arguments in my view ring a bit hollow from the United States of America about the possible neglect of our international obligations in the same week as President Bush has so publicly repudiated the Kyoto agreement on climate change . #% Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . - Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission will withdraw its proposal . #% In view of the lacuna which has opened up after the somewhat pot-pourri result of Nice , I urge both the Commission and the Council to look very favourably at the idea of an Interinstitutional Agreement in this field . #% Of the amendments tabled for Plenary , the ALDE Group will be supporting those which underline that the pace of market opening should be driven by the ACP and that there is scope for the EU to work much more closely with ACP partners in world trade negotiations . #% But look at some of the licensing issues . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mrs Paulsen very warmly on her diligence and skill in bringing through another complex piece of food safety legislation . #% Huge numbers of people oppose live exports ; they are unnecessary , cruel and unjustifiable . #% We are also looking forward to the debate on Dublin II , although our group will support Amendment 17 on that . #% That is why the amendments proposed and supported by the committee are technical ones . #% The EU peer review , conducted under the auspices of the Council , should make this decision , taking account of the results of the IAEA mission in June and an objective analysis of the economic consequences of closure . #% These are allegations for which he has never produced a shred of evidence , despite being requested to do so . #% Growth and stability are twin pillars . #% Last month he was in New York at the United Nations World Children 's Summit . #% I also feel that they should not be enforceable by the EU on Member States beyond the present commitment represented by their signatures on the European Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% In these schools too the quality of their education is often affected by the fact that they are not taught in their own language . #% MEPs and NGOs worked very hard to get Article 13 into the Treaty . #% According to Eurobarometer , 87 % of citizens recognise their right to go to the European Ombudsman . #% We need to distinguish more between what is important and what is less important . #% I should like to correct you , Madam President . #% In conclusion , the key element is that of the inclusion of the self-employed . #% There is a tremendous disparity in criminal and indeed in civil law . #% Firstly concerning the Solidarity Fund : this , of course , was the allocation in respect of the floods in Britain in June and July last year . #% Therefore , I am opposed to moving it . #% Mr President , along with my colleagues , I would like to welcome the very clear document that the Portuguese Presidency has given us today . #% The people who continue to suffer are the ordinary people and civilians of India , Pakistan and Kashmir . #% The first principle of the review - creating a right environment - should not mean proposing new rules such as European private companies and state aids . #% Finally , as Co-President of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly , I think that we have a very serious role to play in the EU 's negotiations . #% Mr President , I have to say that in both the Council and Commission statements I detect a rather worrying element of complacency . #% Mr Pirker has spoken of the delays that have occurred and the numerous times that this vital issue has been reconsidered . #% Mr Schulz was quite right . #% Look at some of the other issues which hold companies back . #% We hope Parliament will agree to the proposal in the amendment that I and other Members of Parliament have tabled to host ASEP III early in 2004 . #% The Court asked whether the Commission had set up an adequate system of management . #% I made the point on several occasions in July that the three institutions must seriously discuss the problems of trying to finance categories 3 , 4 and 5 for the future . #% Madam President , we have been on a long journey . #% I therefore welcome the statement yesterday by the British Muslim Council which has called upon all the leaders within their mosques to reject terrorism and to cooperate fully with the UK police and authorities in identifying those behind these recent attempts at violence . #% I recognise the enormous progress that Bulgaria has made in economic , political and social reform in recent years . #% The subcontinent of India has enormous potential but , as has been pointed out , many problems and tensions to be tackled particularly in its relationships with its immediate neighbours . #% Mr President , the European Coal and Steel Community was a landmark in European integration and has shown itself in many respects to be more supranational than many other recent additions to the European Treaties . #% If there are going to be changes they should only be small , detailed and technical changes to the constitution . #% The redistribution from agriculture to other items of expenditure is something that should be welcomed . #% First and foremost , jobs is our top priority . #% I have time to make one simple point . #% However , on the question of balance , I still feel very frustrated that legal migration and rights of migrants have been neglected . #% Mr President , the election last year of Dr Mohamed Khatami as President of Iran was expected in a number of quarters to herald a substantial improvement in the state 's attitude on human rights issues . #% I do not know exactly how much the Commission has revised its growth figures as a result of what has happened in Asia but the potential for catastrophe has not gone . #% 
It will be closely studied in Turkey , where the reformers will find much to encourage them in their efforts to bring Turkey forward on the track of modernisation , liberalisation , full respect for fundamental rights and social and economic progress . #% However today 's debate needs to look beyond the effects of the crisis and the immediate remedies and consider the phenomenon of globalisation . #% I do not want to be too critical about this , because a number of aspects of this question of the financing of universal service , and indeed of the definitions , are contained in a variety of pieces of legislation - some of which , but not all , is logical . #% The Commission say it is far too difficult for them to organise the stamping of a special code on non-compliant eggs , despite its obvious necessity . #% Others have not even used the same methodology , the same basis of calculation as others . #% I would respectfully submit that it would have been better to stop the voting a little earlier to restore calm in case colleagues voted the wrong way not knowing what the vote was . #% We must draft this new legislation with a clear working memory as to the flaws and obstacles of the European Arrest Warrant . #% Secondly , will it withdraw its own amendments , passed in committee , which insist on negotiated access ? #% I say this knowing full well the massive pressures there are upon Congress in an election year . #% Secondly , it is important that we maintain this industry as well because it is an important technology driver which feeds into the civil markets and produces many valuable products , enabling us to enjoy a high standard of living in our Western European Union countries at the moment . #% Mr McMillan-Scott blew the whistle in 1989 about events then , and during the five years afterwards his reports were to some extent ignored and overlooked . #% The Sinnotts and the public have a right to know the facts . #% No more naming and shaming , no more buck-passing ; we need the British government , the French government , the SNCF , Eurotunnel , EWS and others to start working together more effectively . #% It is also interesting to note that only some Member States have actually acceded to this Strasbourg agreement , which , in many respects , is obsolete . #% I am giving advance notice that this is a matter subject to a query and that we may have to object to this item on the agenda . #% On the one hand , it is also important to ensure that the updated statistics are as complete as possible , giving a good overview of tourism across Europe , whilst , on the other hand , bearing in mind the need to keep the burden down for respondents . #% Nevertheless , the opinion that we put forward reflected the concerns of a majority of our members and those concerns were particularly directed at the need for , and importance of , employee information and consultation . #% It is important that Parliament prepares to become a generalist parliament - that is to say , that we have to start to do everything efficiently and expediently across the policy spectrum . #% I also commend the directive on mutual assistance for recovery of claims but consider a lower threshold for implementation more appropriate . #% Firstly , on payments and backlog , we would like to see a real effort being made to reduce the EUR 110 billion in commitments . #% Could you explain why , when we have a very expensive and sophisticated system of electronic voting , we had to go through - and I choose my words carefully - the organised chaos of the previous vote . #% Is he aware that next year is going to be the European Year of Disabled People , and is he taking an interest in that ? #% Mr President , I rise as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mr Hyland on his report and say that it is good that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has taken the initiative in pushing this Charter through Parliament . #% Even in exercising its powers , the Council -- i.e. the Member States -- has a central role in taking decisions , while the central administration -- the European Commission -- has fewer employees than the City of Leeds , in my constituency . #% It will need some backing up . #% Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget . #% The inspectors need more time and we need more information from the Americans . #% Every case is an individual tragedy which tears apart a community . #% These are the only standards which genuinely ensure access for disabled people . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on the report she has put forward . #% Nobody here has pointed out that the problem with the regime at the moment is that a significant number of contracts that ought to be included in this public procurement regime are not . #% This material must be processed and stored , not at the point of delivery far away in Scotland or in England , but stored and processed as near as possible to the point of production . #% In congratulating Mr Menrad on his report I want to concentrate on progress or the lack of it in achieving employment guideline 9 , promoting a labour market open to all . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for that answer and to encourage him , when preparing that draft legislation , to examine whether or not there is a case for phasing out livestock markets entirely . #% The outbursts in Seattle and Davos for instance were not just about the issues - they were very much about a populace and a citizenry trying to engage with a new set of institutions and being not quite sure of how to do so . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , may I first of all congratulate the Swedish Government on its Presidency in general and particularly on the way it has attempted to advance the very important issues of climate change and dealing with the economic and financial crisis that faces us . #% The approach has been very much welcomed by the Musicians Union of Great Britain who acted to coordinate the work of musicians ' unions across the European Union . #% These measures , when put in place , are ones in which we can have confidence . #% Mr President , I too regret the absence of the Commissioner here this evening . #% Castro has recently expelled visiting European MPs and NGO workers keen to engage with dissidents under the Varela Project . #% Traceability rules should be established so that this is done even when the presence of GMO DNA can not be identified . #% In the remaining three weeks of the Luxembourg presidency , for all its skilful diplomacy I would be surprised if this were to be part of any package , if indeed the Council has a position . #% We should build on the work of the Arctic Council . #% We look to the spring Council in March to reverse the failures of recent times and put Europe firmly on a free market and enterprise-driven path . #% We MEPs in this House long to see a democratic and free Iran , which no longer exports terrorism via Hamas and Hezbollah , and takes its rightful place in the international community . #% Firstly , the Commission 's powers are scrutinised only by committees of national civil servants , which alone have the power to block the Commission and call back the decision to the legislative authority . #% Consequently I have tabled an amendment asking for the subsequent reviews - the annual reviews I have already referred to - to take this point into account . #% Mr President , this very good report shows Turkey is making progress towards Europe , but more is needed . #% No , we will decide - and that is something to protect Members and should be a guarantee for Members . #% We would also be interested to see what the foreign policy link is going to be in this discussion on radicalisation . #% Mr President , in two years of negotiation for seven years of European regional aid , of course there are areas where we would have wished to go further : clearer commitments , the partnership by local and regional authorities , even further guarantees that payments will be made on time to those delivering projects , a specific figure for social risk capital for the smaller voluntary organisations to benefit . #% I know you share our concerns . #% Madam President , I want to express my delight at this report having been adopted without amendment . #% author . - Madam President , recently King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was afforded a controversial state visit to the United Kingdom . #% New models are developing . #% It would be folly for Europe 's leaders just to ignore the reality of what has happened . #% Regarding the McCartin report , I want to put on record , especially for people in the public gallery , some of the simple facts which we should be talking about . #% The purpose of the Dublin Convention and Eurodac is to allocate to a single Member State responsibility for examining an asylum application , and the justification for the proposed regulation is that there is a need to extend fingerprinting to certain categories of illegal immigrants on the grounds that a substantial number of them will have claimed asylum previously or intend to do so . #% For these reasons we felt unable to support the resolution in its finally amended version . #% We need to learn lessons on both sides but I very much hope that even at this late stage there can be some sort of resolution . #% I just want to give the Committee one example of this : ad hominem arguments are always dangerous , but I have a producer in my own area who turned to a particular plant protection range of products because he was himself alarmed by the effect of dangerous pesticides as he had seen them . #% This report assists in creating an EU cross-border standard which could provide for an improved supply into and across the EU so that such families of individuals needing organs can be more easily met with the hope of relieving their conditions . #% Does the Commission expect companies to run two systems , one for internal transactions and one for external , thereby increasing costs ? #% I am looking at Article 2 ( 2 ) and I can not see that exclusion set out there . #% Secondly , it is important that Member States of the European Union show their commitment to this process by ratifying the association agreements which have already been agreed ; and I underline the importance of Amendment No 14 which Mr Sakellariou tabled . #% 
The question of the threshold is settled quite reasonably in favour of small political movements with real and serious European objectives . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , on behalf of my political group , and also as the chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I want to thank Mrs Weiler in particular as the rapporteur , and also all the many colleagues from the committee who are here today , for a great example of teamwork . #% Madam President , on the same subject of TV reception , as raised by my colleague Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , I wish to express the hope that the technical problems currently preventing the reception of BBC1 and BBC2 can be resolved . #% My group wants to ensure that when the European Central Bank is established and when the 11 countries create the euro zone , without prejudice to that price stability , we begin , with some urgency , to address the wider issues within the European Union , not least the question of growth and unemployment . #% I would urge that our agricultural communities be given this information as quickly as possible so that they can plan ahead knowing that at least one area will not be as uncertain as many others in the years ahead . #% I am not convinced by the argument that we can not do it and I shall be voting firmly for the fact that these limits should be etched in stone . #% We do not have debates in this institution , but tightly controlled and orchestrated speaking time , without the opportunity for reply . #% This is a new approach and I hope that it will be more successful than the approach of some of the Commissioner 's predecessors in this area . #% It needs coordination between donors , for example as took place after the coup in the Central African Republic in 2003 . #% Our hearts go out too to the French student who was detained by the Iranian authorities . #% This report is well named , for ` exploitation ' is exactly what has happened to the once abundant North Sea fisheries . #% If we continue down this route , Britain will have lost its biggest single industry . #% Many of these problems have been solved by our amendments , and I would appeal to the Council to accept those amendments adopted today . #% Since writing the report , I have been heartened to notice that a number of national governments , as well as leading agricultural organisations , have called for simplification of the common agricultural policy . #% Fast track extradition will be introduced , which may even help bring ex-dictators to justice . #% In terms of the amendments , the Group of the European People 's Party has tabled two amendments which are designed to weaken the report . #% It is not only an equality issue . #% Does the Commissioner still believe that his statement of 28 June was a necessary and sufficient answer to the concerns that have been raised ? #% If human rights are of any importance , there can be no impunity for those who organise a reign of terror . #% Many share the British Conservative vision of an EU that is a loose community of sovereign nations , focused on the single market and cooperating closely in other areas where there is real added value . #% Mr President , like many British Members , I live in two worlds . #% We have made very clear to this House and to the Council that all changes arising from reform and from pay and pension proposals will keep within the limits set by the relevant part of the Financial Perspective established by the Berlin Council in 1999 . #% I voted in favour of taking inland waterways out of the scope of this Directive for a number of reasons . #% Amendment 17 to Article 5 asks the Commission to bring in a clear labelling system for meat that is imported into the European Union after the legislation has been in place for six months . #% There will be increased competition , increased consumer choice and lower prices in financial products which the financial services action plan can deliver , if we manage to get it right . #% I hope that this second-reading agreement will have real results and will encourage the free movement of construction products , improve standards across the EU , and promote the recycling of construction products in future whilst , most importantly , not increasing bureaucratic burdens on businesses or confusing consumers . #% There are just two points I want to make . #% This is a dramatic step which reduces the chances of Cuba becoming part of Cotonou . #% In keeping with the method which we have used on all reform-related proposals each of the documents will be the subject of serious and detailed negotiations with staff representatives and wider consultations with staff over the coming four and a half months . #% Any of us who have a passion for quality in this field ought to accept that with the enormous proliferation of television in the future the staple diet there ought to be the secondary market for films which will be made in increasing numbers . #% Setting up an agency to oversee the Charter of Fundamental Rights was a colossal waste of taxpayers ' money and an exercise in vanity . #% Those on the left of this House offer little help to those who need it , especially to those who need our protection and our support . #% Part of this is keeping the cost to a reasonable level and to bear in mind that the targets can not be met without necessary technical ability . #% Our businesses want to sharpen their ability to compete in global markets , not to be weighed down by unnecessary red tape and socialist regulation , much of which originates in Brussels and is then gold plated by our own Labour Government . #% Mr President , the truly frustrating thing about the fiasco we saw at the IGC in Brussels was that , Poland aside , a solid agreement was closer to being reached than is frequently appreciated . #% I call on the Commissioner to argue with some force in favour of the proposals to which she has referred to support the right of genuine family reunion in all European countries . #% I am now the President of the Taiwanese Friendship Group in this Parliament . #% Secondly , on effective enforcement of consumer protection rules , again we agree - perhaps from slightly different standpoints . #% In the limited time available for this statement , it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals . #% The job is done by the boss and either the boss 's wife or husband . #% The review 's five guidelines to reduce pressure on SMEs include simplifying the rules on VAT and reducing the rates , and a directive on late payments , but that is just tinkering with existing rules and regulations . #% However , we can do more here in Europe . #% So they resorted to lies and deceit , they staged the most spectacular bureaucratic coup d'état that the world had ever seen . #% Lastly , I ask the Commissioner to concur that although Aung San Suu Kyi -- whose house arrest is unreasonable -- is a crucial player in the Burma affair , we must accept that many others are also languishing in prison , including many members of the Burmese parliament . #% Each member of the State Peace and Development Council that runs Burma must be held personally responsible for the health , safety and wellbeing of Aung San Suu Kyi . #% I can not vote for lesser price cuts , increased compensation , and less quota cuts than proposed by the Commission . #% But a darker interpretation , reflecting on some Member States themselves , will be cast by the fact that Member States - and in many cases the supervisors are the culprits - were not bolder incoming clean . #% That is what the people themselves want , let alone the governments involved . #% I commend this report as a good example of that process . #% That is why it is important that we vote this afternoon . #% How to involve the national parliamentarians too is a very important aspect and lastly , it is right , as the President of the Council said , that this is a new departure for Europe as a way of amending Treaties rather than having decisions made behind closed doors and smoke-filled rooms early in the morning . #% Nevertheless , as the European Union in general and the euro zone in particular are our largest trading partners , we are ever vigilant of the need for the euro 's stability , since this directly affects Britain 's prosperity . #% I ask for your support . #% But I welcome the signs of change . #% I therefore call on the Commission to give an urgent account of the Chinese accession talks to Parliament , and particularly as to how they may affect our preparations for Seattle , so that Parliament can vote tomorrow on Mr Schwaiger ' s report in full command of all the relevant facts . #% Like him , I very much hope that we can sort this out at first reading . #% Landmine clearance , customs and the procurement of essential supplies for rehabilitation of housing , public buildings and , in particular , Mitrovica Hospital are the main focus of attention . #% When I was younger I played rugby and I recall a match that was not going well . #% There has been a great improvement in these reports , particularly perhaps since the actions of the Dutch presidency and the taking on board by the Commissioner responsible of my report last year . #% We have had agreements since then to grant autonomy to the Northeast Tamil region , which have been abrogated by the government . #% We urge the Commission , the Council and this Parliament to do all they can to ensure that the current rapprochement between India and Pakistan is not damaged by these incidents . #% Nevertheless , as responsible citizens and elected representatives of the people , we need to do what we can in the fight against serious crime . #% We can not afford to allow that to continue to happen . #% That range of opportunities is , I think , appropriate . #% Finally , America perhaps is a country which is certainly not used to , and may not wish to , share sovereignty and multinational institutions , as we have become more used to in Europe . #% We must continue down this route . #% 
Two weeks ago , Age Concern England held an important debate in London called ` Creating opportunity -- is Europe working for older people ? ' . #% What a nonsense that we are spending EUR 200 million a year of taxpayers ' money on the monthly jaunt to Strasbourg . #% This is an injustice which needs remedying . #% Indeed , I believe the concept of human rights should inform everything we do in the name of democracy because a negative human rights situation is often caused or exacerbated by the absence of democracy and inefficient and corrupt government structures . #% We also appreciate very much the work of the Ombudsman in developing the network of ombudsmen across the whole of Europe and in other countries . #% We know that the ` long hours ' culture , for whatever reason , brings strain , stress and potential breakdown . #% It took the great artist Peggy Lee nearly 20 years to outface the Disney Corporation to receive continuing payments for the voiceovers that she had done for some Disney cartoon films . #% I wish that phrase could be plastered in massive letters on billboards around the United Kingdom so that my fellow subjects could really understand what is really going on . #% Instead , the EU should do less but do it better . #% There are many critical issues in this report - the title of the food safety authority has been crucial to us . #% Mr President , I wish to flag up a serious threat to civil liberties , the environment and animal welfare in the United Kingdom . #% We have received numerous petitions from citizens across the EU concerning confiscation of their cars by the Greek authorities . #% It is absolutely imperative that they get that . #% Therefore , I urge colleagues to vote for the rest . #% What Mr Corbett says about the principles of the Union may sound fine , but we are seeing shifts and changes in the law . #% There is no obligation on the Commission to respond , but we would expect the Commission , in a spirit of cooperation with Parliament , to look at these proposals carefully and to respond in most cases . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs has stated , and I quote : ` the company has been the victim of a flagrant denial of justice ' on the part of the Commission . #% If I thought that an embryo had the same human rights as a child or an adult human being , I would not , of course , not be in favour of anything that meant the destruction of human life . #% It is time to consider what action should be taken against those who seek to attack the basic rules of the single market . #% We should say to those who made these accusations that we can not be bought in this House and that we can not be bullied either . #% Let us minimize the risk of horrific accidents on the roads where hazardous materials are involved . #% In fact the ECB first cut interest rates in May 2001 despite a continuing rise in inflation , which had still to peak at 3.4 % . #% We must get the balance right . #% We welcome very warmly today the presence in the Chamber of Secretary-General Kofi Annan . #% The most glaring , gaping hole in the proposal is that it does not actually prohibit the import and sale of illegally logged timber - perverse as that sounds . #% In particular , the paragraph prejudices the current voluntary arrangements for EU Member States , and we should not underplay national response capacities , particularly when the UK 's own standing response team rolled into action within one hour of the earthquake in Haiti . #% Most of all , I regret that the Socialist Group and the European People 's Party have done this deal on pushing the date for the introduction of vehicles using carbon dioxide back to 2011 from the original proposal of the committee for 2009 . #% That consumer pressure was quite rightly cited by his colleague , Mr Monti , when we had a complete and total reform of the legislation relating to the selling and servicing of motor cars . #% We want to ensure that issues such as non-discrimination and equal opportunities are built into the programmes for education and training in the new democracies . #% It is a common-sense idea to have the tolerance thresholds to make sure that we have proper clean-up between the different kinds of feed manufacture . #% This amendment , which opposes Strasbourg sessions , is consistent with the Treaty obligations , enables Parliament to choose the place of its own sitting for once , and puts a stop to this travelling circus backwards and forwards between here and Brussels , which will become even more difficult post-enlargement for those countries given the poor communications by air to Strasbourg . #% We must not overlook the fact that the short sea shipping sector could play a key role in fulfilling our environmental objectives . #% Members come to Parliament to talk and if they arrive in the Chamber expecting to vote and find that a debate is still in progress , it is not unnatural that they should speak to each other . #% Whilst I can agree that an effective solution might be energy saving , it is only a part of the wider approach necessary . #% A transfer of coalition troops or , indeed , a complete withdrawal is unrealistic and risks worsening an already bad situation . #% As has already been said , the report covers a number of important points : the high standards we expect , the primacy of protection , the issue of raising the quality of decision-making , the availability of sound country information to all those involved in the process , effective staff training , the use of the quality initiative ( recently seen in the UK , which certainly needed some help ) and the involvement of the UNHCR . #% This is why I asked the question ! #% in writing . - I , on behalf of the EPLP , did not support the report on EU agriculture and international trade . #% This resolution will be a significant message to those extremists that the people of Europe are in solidarity with all those who value and defend religious and communal tolerance . #% Madam President , I thank the rapporteur for producing this own-initiative report , allowing us to debate what is an important initiative . #% To those colleagues who feared that there may be elements of my report which are unfavourable to the smaller groups , I would like to reassure them . #% There is another point which is important from the point of view of accountability : we will have a centralized monetary authority but we will have a decentralized fiscal policy in the European Union . #% The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars . #% When he heard about the IFF , Nelson Mandela said that it was an absolutely necessary and timely initiative that deserves an active response from the international community . #% Finally , I wish to place on record my gratitude to the Commissioner for transport , Mr Kinnock , for the prompt and sympathetic way in which he has responded to me on this matter . #% Decisions on asylum should take months - not years . #% And , if so , will he put his personal commitment behind it to persuade his colleagues in the 24 other countries that this is an idea worth pursuing . #% There is very little disagreement between the Socialist Group and the EPP Group . #% It has also passed legislation that has led to the closure of hundreds of local abattoirs . #% For example , it is the EU which is ruthlessly driving forward the agenda for a new , ambitious , comprehensive round of trade talks at Doha in November in the face of opposition from the majority of developing countries and of social movements around the world . #% In having too many words , there is a risk of losing focus on what we wish to achieve . #% Such events are invaluable in briefing Members on the issues surrounding the disease and the problems faced by sufferers . #% If I could try and summarise this in two sentences , it would be to say ` yes ' to better information , consultation and more systematic consultation of non-governmental actors and so on , but ` no ' to delegating decisions to a sort of cosy deal between the Commission and industry . #% I deliberately did not devote much of the report to the measures on tobacco consumption which are expected imminently from the Commission because we thought that that would come at the same time . #% Firstly , to remind all of us who are fit and active today that tomorrow we could find ourselves in a wheelchair . #% I think that is to some extent a condemnation of the timetabling of Parliament 's business . #% She should ask herself whether an intifada has to be armed to qualify as a genuine intifada . #% Technological progress calls for a highly-qualified , flexible workforce , which in turn expects a more participative working situation . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for all his hard work on this report . #% Mr President , I hope we can get agreement on the Sixth Environmental Action Programme , preferably without going into conciliation . #% Mr President , I was given to understand that the President was going to be in the chair this morning at this time and I hope he is not unavoidably detained . #% It is a pity that we could not get a big majority in this House to send a clear signal on behalf of the whole Parliament . #% I would like to know how many rapid alerts throughout the European Union have been proclaimed in this calendar year as a result of this continuing anxiety about carcinogens like nitrofuran when residues are discovered in imports . #% For that is what we are saying if we gloss over the human rights issue . #% This does not in any way affect the individual Member States ' procedures . #% I should like to draw to the Commissioner 's attention the difficulties being experienced in exercising that duty in relation to some socalled quota-hoppers . #% 
I believe that the golden age of Europe 's rural areas lies in the future not in the past . #% We have still not received a response . #% If I came from Burkina Faso or Mali or one of the countries that produced beurre de karité and I was told that the women ' s cooperatives who collect the shea nuts that are a substantial part of their exports to Europe , will be banned or put at risk because they are seen to be stooges of the multinationals , I would be very angry indeed . #% Approximation and mutual recognition of national criminal provisions , which is not the same as harmonisation , will be of the utmost utility , as will cooperation through police forces and Europol , insisting all the time , as the Parliament does , on adequate parliamentary and judicial scrutiny . #% It is therefore very unfortunate that the report also puts forward proposals for a common defence policy which are not acceptable in a number of Member States and go further than public opinion would be prepared to support . #% We have to improve the ways that we do that . #% The establishment of blacklists is , however , only effective if there are serious consequences for the vessels concerned . #% This serious issue needs to be investigated and therefore I challenge this House to support me in the call for a temporary committee of enquiry , the papers of which will be ready for the next Strasbourg session . #% Given Hans Blix 's report , it could be argued that Paragraph 4 has already been breached . #% British Labour Euro MPs give our wholehearted support to this process , and to Parliament 's vote today . #% Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for the debate they have both facilitated . #% So , may I ask you to invite the Commission , at the end of today 's proceedings , to come and explain that decision so that ordinary people can actually try and understand the thought processes which , I have to say , completely confound me . #% Earlier in this debate Ms Attwooll said that Amendment No 71 , for example , would guard against any adverse effects . #% In Britain , if you go to your doctor 's surgery , you expect the nice new doctor from Italy or Lithuania or wherever to be qualified , and you assume that the proper checks have been made as to his or her integrity and experience and to ensure that the name does not figure on any blacklist for professional or other malpractice . #% We were then told that , even though there was half an hour until the departure of the Strasbourg flight , we would be transferred to a flight five hours later . #% What effect will this have on the EU-India FTA ? #% I have to cover my face with paper towels and run through to my office . #% Now the US is at risk , a different double standard applies : the US Government believes that it has the right to disregard the Geneva Convention and all civilised standards and to kidnap , detain , abuse and torture terrorist suspects . #% Finally I want to commend the part of the resolution that welcomes the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue on which this Parliament has set such great store , and I very much hope we want that to continue and be strengthened as part of a constructive and good-tempered dialogue . #% I find it very striking that both the Commission and the Council have failed to do that this time . #% Given its enhanced legal status , this document will be of greater significance than any of the other environmental action plans I have seen going through Parliament in the last 10 or so years . #% It seems there is no-one here tonight from the Committee on Budgets , but they are the people who can help make sure that Euronews succeeds . #% However , on a practical level , I believe it is essential for MPs and MEPs to work more closely together to ensure the correct transposition of legislation . #% Mr President , I would like to draw attention to a number of budget lines that are dealt with in the Committee on Employment . #% Does the Commission share the view that the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline is a project of great importance both for the future of European energy supplies and for the economic development of Turkey and other countries in the region ? #% A further cull , as we know , is on the way and this clears the way for the five points that were agreed at Florence . #% As Mr Koukiadis states in his report , it is important that every effort should be made to get to the root of infringements and find ways of reducing their number without relying exclusively on the standard infringement procedure . #% Above all , the IGC will make it capable of functioning and carrying out its responsibilities when it is composed of more than 20 Member States . #% The British have got their way in that Member States will be allowed to refuse reception assistance where the asylum seeker can not show that he has made his claim as soon as possible . #% I commend the proposals which were adopted unanimously by the Commission for consultation today . #% We should be aware that Iraq 's policy is to award gas and oil concessions to countries supporting the easing or lifting of UN sanctions . #% Funding for this programme also raised serious concerns , especially given the austerity measures currently afflicting culture departments across Europe . #% I hope that they will be pleased with the results that we have achieved . #% The least efficient is the democracy . #% Mr President , I should like to thank both rapporteurs , and I welcome these initiatives . #% It is important that the institutions of the Union serve the European citizen and not the other way around . #% How can we maintain long-term programmes of support for the poorest parts of the world if we are constantly robbing Peter to pay Paul ? #% The President of Iran thinks that Israel should be wiped off the map . #% It was heartening to us , as Parliament , to have representatives from no less than three DGs of the Commission present at the conciliation and working together . #% Article 2 refers to sustainable development as one of the objectives of the European Union , although many of us might question the methods which are set down to attain it . #% Anti-EU campaigns in countries such as Ireland have clearly demonstrated the need for a positive communication strategy . #% However , the appeasers in this House might like to explain why they embraced a war in Kosovo that involved no weapons of mass destruction or threats to neighbouring states and that had no UN authority whatsoever , and yet find it so difficult to take action against a genocidal dictator who has started two wars responsible for the deaths of almost a million people and who has gassed his own people . #% There are a number of methods by which we can improve evacuation measures . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to thank Mr Sterckx for his report which addresses an important aspect of the civil aviation industry . #% This is what the consumer needs to know , particularly for home sellers and those who are going door-to-door with products , e.g. cosmetics salespeople and so on . #% On the conclusions : the Committee of Inquiry was right to hold back from proposing a single customs service . #% Does the Council believe that the Member States would agree to support the declared wish of all African Heads of State that finance be managed under the African Union 's authority and in no other way ? #% Culture surely has a huge role to play in this respect . #% How does the Commission see the protection of European agriculture when it comes to imports from countries which do not have the sort of animal welfare legislation that we have in the European Union ? #% What I am pleased to see with this proposal is that we are finally moving in the direction when the days when we can throw fridges , televisions , toasters , mobile phones and other electrical goods into a landfill are over . #% This is timely as , tomorrow , as you are very well aware , the signing of the UN Convention on People with Disabilities will take place . #% I would urge all Members of the House , including my colleague Mr Provan , to vote in favour of this suggestion . #% We would also urge Members States at the next IGC , to adopt a legal base to promote and protect the rights of the child as defined in the United Nations Convention . #% We hope firstly that in the environmental action programme , which the world is eagerly awaiting , the Commission will key in adequate resources for following up what has happened to legislation . #% Parliament has already discussed the problems of phthalates , the substance used to soften plastics , in the context of children 's toys . #% Britain still has -- the right to trial by jury and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty -- and some of us in Britain intend , and want , that we should keep those safeguards . #% On this side we are quite clear in our approach . #% However , EU officials quickly informed him and the British public that this is an area of policy , like so many others , that is now under the control of the European Union and not the British Government . #% This morning I asked for the youth volunteer service to be called the Mitterand Volunteers . #% I welcome this report which represents a big step towards making the EU the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world by 2010 . #% I should like to make three points in this debate . #% Therefore , there must be possibilities for the consumer to have extra safeguards around the setting up of direct debits . #% Elderly people should be encouraged to remain active because otherwise , as previous speakers have said , this will ultimately cost more money than we are able to afford at the moment . #% On all sides of this House we have to be very honest with ourselves if we want Luxembourg to be a success . #% There are massive disparities in cancer treatment and screening across Europe . #% The hard part really begins today . #% 
Let us not just talk about reducing poverty and making poverty history , but let us take real concrete steps to promote trade , which offers the only real solution . #% How many prospective MEPs will be standing on this ticket ? #% I speak on behalf of Mr Gargani , the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs , in whose name our opinion stands . #% Mr President , safety at sea is a priority for us all in the European Parliament , in particular for the Socialist Group . #% Would Mr Prodi agree that the White Paper will be a most sensible contribution to the work of that convention ? #% They give us ambitions so we believe we can climb the heights of Olympus and then they ensure that we never reach the top . #% The notion that we punish children for the sins of the parents is one we rightly oppose around the world , but apparently it is now OK within Europe . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I fully support efforts to make the activities of sports agents , mainly in football , more transparent and I believe that the EU should be supporting the various sporting governing bodies to ensure that they can do just that . #% The single market is a shared project of all of us . #% I , like them , have a very strong constituency interest in the maintenance of fish stocks , in my case particularly in the North Sea . #% Mr President , I wish to devote my contribution to this morning 's debate to the report on decentralized cooperation drawn up by its excellent rapporteur , Mr Vecchi . #% One often sees a presidency looking at a problem firmly in the eye , and then running away . #% Democracy may be inconvenient , but it is all we have between freedom and tyranny . #% We have seen already from the quality of the contributions across the political field how engaged we are with the topic . #% Why has it taken two years ? #% in writing . - The key aspects of Mr Langen 's report are acceptable . #% Certainly , the idea of an envoy and other suggestions are very welcome indeed . #% One French ferret apparently seems to have been the cause of all the concern about whether ferrets can cause rabies . #% A single market can not function properly whilst labour markets remain protected and sealed off . #% Indeed , the salary of both the Data Protection Supervisor and his assistant has resulted in numerous discussions within our committees . #% One hopes that it is hidden somewhere in the Commission accounts . #% When the whole of Europe is turning its eyes to the hundreds of thousands of refugees on the borders of Kosovo , it may seem strange to raise this one case . #% That ought to have happened a long time ago . #% Tourism should become treaty based , not so that operators incur excessive regulation - indeed , the growth of the industry depends upon its ability to innovate independently - but so that it is seen as a serious European issue . #% I would hope that out of the Hampton Court discussions came a clarification of the role of Member States and the important role of the European Commission in ensuring that Member States carry out that which they have already agreed . #% This report is about breaking down barriers for disabled people , to get rid of the prejudices that disabled people face in their daily lives across the European Union . #% What are we doing here today ? #% Accordingly , we have evolved our own system of controls . #% But of course the big challenge , and what you will be judged by , is whether you can turn this ship around ; whether you can make Europe more competitive ; whether you can make the Lisbon Agenda appear to be rather more than just a child 's wish list to Father Christmas . #% I would like an answer on that . #% Mr President , I can clear up Mr Cohn-Bendit 's confusion . #% It is essential , therefore , that our commitment to poverty eradication , gender mainstreaming and conflict prevention should be fully integrated into the trade proposals , particularly in the context of the middle income countries . #% One way we can help is to find better methods of compensating rural inhabitants for the provision of environmental services . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the ECR Group favours enlargement of the European Union . #% I would like to feel that at the same time we are looking at other issues which , because they are cherished in some Member State or in some particular group or community within the European Union , are shrugged aside . #% However , to coincide with World Environment Day yesterday , the UK Government made known that this funding would end in September . #% Nevertheless , it is important to share best practice . #% It is so important to remember that this financial crisis has a human face as well and that face is represented quite often by the already most marginalised in society . #% It is a sad day when all the Members of this House can not do the same . #% In fact we have a work programme , a work programme - not a legislative programme - outlining priorities . #% I would like to think that in future the very interesting matters that we discuss in the Rules of Procedure Committee will attract the attention from all colleagues that they deserve . #% He is right to say that we have responded to the current crisis with a coherence and unity that we would not have thought possible only four or five years ago . #% The first concerned reefs off the north-west coast of Scotland , the Darwin Mounds , for which I was fortunate enough to be rapporteur . #% We also back the proposal to include within the scheme mechanisms for resolving disputes outside the courts . #% However , I am prepared to listen to colleagues and accept that there are very real market implications to the proposal which are needed to control sulphur . #% If we could go beyond ideology and all agree on this objective , the present crisis will have at least had one beneficial outcome . #% It is a proposal for a Council directive which takes a positive step towards the completion of the single market and at the same time provides a framework for the harmonization of construction standards between all Member States which in itself will engender and encourage trade between them . #% Mr President , I should like to join in congratulating Mr Bertens and thank him for incorporating amendments which I moved as part of the Committee on Development and Cooperation 's opinion on this report . #% Our citizens believe that there should be a concerted , integrated approach by the public authorities to combat poverty and social exclusion , 89 % believing that the European Union should be intervening . #% In the Gomel Oblast , which is contaminated , there are 2 million people , including 500 00 children . #% Mr President , under Item 19 of the Minutes on the discharge , it mentions that I had a report on the EDF but when you look at the speakers ' list you will see that I did not speak . #% I hope the Commission will take this with the seriousness it deserves because this is a very important economic matter . #% I could list a number of NGOs and others who have , in fact , waited 6 000 days and are still waiting . #% Should this not be made conditional on the disapplication of internationally unacceptable , cruel and unusual punishments such as those I have just referred to ? #% There are many well-rehearsed arguments setting out the current difficulties that we are facing in the textiles sector here in the European Union . #% It is actually about CO2 emissions from passenger cars and the way in which taxation can be used to deal with this and to improve our environment . #% I really do urge you - the publications , the seminars , the debates that you organise in Brussels are not the way to reach 300 million people the length and breadth of Europe . #% May I take the question on the Fischler proposals for the mid-term review a little further with the Commissioner ? #% There is also a misunderstanding about the civil liberties implications . #% Those special circumstances should now be defined to include the risk of a further prolongation of the recession in Germany and in France which , together , represent half of the euro area . #% The report will serve as the first contribution to the Convention on the question of competences . #% Europe is moving ahead quite rightly with its legislation for safety on ro-ro ferries which is a form of transport that is both theoretically and , as we have seen , practically potentially a very unstable form of craft . #% Madam President , I am grateful to you for giving me the floor . #% -- Mr President , I should like to point out , on behalf of the Socialist Group and my colleague , Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco , that we believe there may be an error on the voting list concerning Amendment 15 , tabled by the PPE-DE Group . #% Nevertheless , I voted against the report as a sign of my protest at the Israeli Government 's outrageous actions in Gaza , even if there is no excuse for the rocket attacks on Israeli settlements orchestrated by Hamas militants and one can understand that Israel reacts . #% Secondly , the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network comprises a series of 40 different institutions from amongst the almost 200 Member States of the WHO . #% 
Frankly , if we were dealing only with the issue of the Commission , we would say ` no ' to urgency , but in this case the people who would lose out are the people of Georgia . #% This proposal was supported unanimously in committee because we believe something has to be done , and done quickly , to meet consumer demands for labelling and to meet consumers ' justified concerns about knowing what they are eating . #% They set political priorities . #% Instead they will ask Americans to face this increasingly dangerous world without illusions . #% It can build into that report all the new ones that it wants to incorporate . #% But we do not want disabled people to be seen as victims , we want them to be seen as achievers like Louise McVay , whose achievements we celebrate in this European Year of Disabled People . #% Earlier this week , Mr Michael Howard , Leader of the Conservative Party , announced policies supposed to halt the flow of uncontrolled asylum seekers into Britain . #% A figure of EUR 500 million for next year focused on Iraq would show very clearly Europe 's willingness to cooperate with the United States and others in bringing that country to the path of prosperity . #% However , construction remains one of the most dangerous areas of work . #% Briefly , about aviation . #% In particular , we want to see a reinstatement of the cuts of EUR 1 million proposed by the Commission in overland transport safety . #% It is an industry that is not subsidised by the common agricultural policy . #% We must recognise that the economic world order is now changing at a pace as never seen before . #% Secondly , on the wider issue of PVCs in general , how soon will we get the kind of migration testing from which phthalates ' safety can be assessed and the review which is called for in one of the amendments ? #% In terms of raising this important issue , I agree with the rapporteur almost entirely . #% I wonder whether this report would have dared to criticize a leader of another major world religion in the same hostile way . #% We are not actually told that in the small print which accompanies its decisions . #% We have travelled quite a distance in terms of the technical work to finally complete this important project . #% That is something that we need to be talking about . #% There was no such condemnation . #% In conclusion , there is a real danger that , by seeking to amend the common position in this regard , we might jeopardise the entire Single European Sky project , something I am sure that we all wish to avoid . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , there is an ideology that is gaining ground in Europe that teaches inequality between men and women . #% Clearly it is a crime that I can not ask a supplementary question , and it has clearly been organised by the Socialists ! #% There is a big budget to open new diplomatic missions , and I must point out that the existence of the post of EU High Representative threatens the permanent seats on the UN Security Council held by the United Kingdom and France , too , Monsieur Daul . #% Indeed , the most recent survey suggests that bank charges vary more widely around the average than they did in the mid-80s at the beginning of the single market programme . #% How many people on that committee have done that ? #% Mr President , I generally welcome the comments both of the previous speaker and Commissioner Nielson who made a statement on behalf of the Commission . #% They are imposing treasury autocracy upon parliamentary democracy . #% The higher the level of integration , the higher the level of unpredictability . #% In addition , and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system , the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - `` the second key '' as Herr Bösch said , established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts . #% However , that amendment does not mention the subject matter . #% For this reason , I think we should actually be pressing ahead with an EU-Japan free trade agreement . #% I notice the Commissioner did not reply to those questions . #% I am not really sure whether WWF counts them amongst its friends . #% The Liberal Group supports the efforts of the presidency and of the Commission to build up the extra trust required . #% The information is already available at centres like the UK 's Atomic Weapons Research Establishment , where all earthquake data is available in real time . #% Elsewhere , I would congratulate the British presidency on taking forward the Luxembourg conclusions on the Middle East peace process . #% Mr President , Indonesia is currently engaging in its largest military operation since the invasion of East Timor in 1975 , against the GAM rebels in Aceh following the breakdown of a five-month-old cease-fire , and already there are reports of widespread suffering and human rights abuses . #% We are totally opposed to that . #% It is important that pollution is controlled and that there is a coherence with the Water Framework Directive . #% There is contradictory legal advice about whether or not it already has such power . #% There is one respect however in which I very much support the excellent work done by the rapporteur . #% There are one or two sections in this report , as drafted , which I believe would benefit from some very minor amendments to tighten them up . #% The European Parliament has been deeply concerned to support democratic development in the Philippines over the years and we very much hope that our resolution today will be taken very seriously . #% As a football fan , I still have absolutely no choice . #% I commend it to you , Commissioner , and I commend it to the House . #% However desirable and however appropriate the Berlaymont is - and we have made that clear throughout - the acceptability of the Berlaymont is conditional upon the satisfaction of standards of quality and the negotiation and conclusion on a reasonable price . #% Mr President , it used to be said that war is too serious a business to be left to generals . #% That is my personal view . #% If one looks at the statistics one finds that 20 % of all accidents on the roads involving heavy goods vehicles are , in fact , caused by drivers suffering from fatigue . #% That is an absolute insult to the people who work there , and more so to their families who live near that site ! #% Thus any new expenditure programmes cost Britain twice ; first we pay our 50 % and then lose two thirds of the EU contribution , diminishing uniquely in our case the EU contribution from 50 % to less than 17 % . #% Mr President , let me now turn directly to Mr Duisenberg and ask him to clarify his position on the choice of monetary policy strategy and instruments to maintain price stability . #% Because specific rail technology has not yet , in my view , been satisfactorily developed to meet the requirements of stages 3 and 4 , I believe it is not possible to establish if and when these requirements can be met . #% This compromise has all the hallmarks of a compromise . #% We now know its general scope , and it is clear that much of the content of this resolution , regardless of its merit or lack of it , has nothing to do with it . #% We do not seem to be putting in first place the importance of targeting proper poverty-alleviation programmes . #% This , above all , makes a reality of bringing Europe closer to its citizens . #% The basic theme of the report is that the current method of managing radio spectrum is no longer adequate in the face of constantly emerging new technologies . #% I repeat again , as I said at that time , that it is a very questionable use of public funds to support people to grow potatoes for starch when there are other sources of starch . #% The consumer is king and we in Parliament - and indeed in the Commission - would do well to remember this . #% Around 75 % of aircraft are involved in accidents during approach , landing or take-off . #% Parliament should say so , loud and clear , to the Council of Ministers . #% This directive is designed to enhance existing legislation in the motor vehicle sector by ensuring that the construction characteristics of vehicles carrying dangerous goods are harmonized throughout the whole Community . #% We are very conscious , in this House , that the Commissioner is engaged in a major negotiation with Council . #% Against this background , the principle of ` comply or explain ' is the right point to start from . #% 
End the dirty dollars and the hot money and we will really put a stop to the senseless and needless deaths . #% One of ways put forward in FAO and WWF discussions has been that this matter should be taken up by the World Trade Organization . #% Colleagues will recall that this is an own-initiative report and in our early discussions in committee some concerns were expressed about the potentially enormous scope of a report on such a broad subject as transport and health . #% European research is therefore absolutely urgent . #% Mr President , I should like to echo other speakers in saying that the Maldives is not the paradise it appears , and tourists must be made aware of that fact . #% Under the current Staff Regulations , social and family rights are provided only for couples who are married . #% This did not happen , so I very much hope that an in-depth analysis of the human rights , environmental and other impacts of this pipeline will form part of the assessment this year . #% I want to pick up a few specific points in relation to issues that he has kindly incorporated in the final report . #% In Britain as a whole 700 companies have been helped but 650 more applied and were eligible . #% We should therefore be making it a priority of the Luxembourg presidency to encourage the Commission to put real resources into consultations at an early stage in its proposals and to test whether its competitiveness is appropriate . #% In the United Kingdom considerable credit could well be paid to the former Conservative government for effecting just that , a policy which has been continued by the current Labour government . #% I note the time-scale of some of his comments that reactors will be shut down early in 2006 and 2008 - I will come to the question of whether a reactor should be shut down or not and how quickly in a moment . #% I have looked quite extensively at the limits proposed in that table with boat-users ' representatives and representatives from industry , and there are no commercially available engines on the market that meet those limits at the moment . #% The random use of antibiotics in agriculture is - or has been - common to all farming , be it large or small . #% I have to say that I remain deeply convinced that both the Commission and the Council , and some Members of this Parliament , have got the argument completely wrong . #% What I said was not ridiculous . #% If you had done that , then we should not have had a dioxin crisis in Belgium . #% What will you do at EU level to promote jobs in the green and youth sectors ? #% We must require alternatives to be used as soon as they are validated . #% All my amendment does is ask the Commission - and it is a logical time to ask when it is thinking about a directive - to look again at what the consequences will be . #% It is a voluntary scheme . #% We know from our own experience in the United Kingdom , when we were dealing with terrorism from the IRA years ago , that we could often see that convictions took priority over evidence and over correct police procedure . #% The concentration on child poverty is welcome . #% A European diplomatic college is a waste of money and would become another burden on the taxpayer . #% Three weeks ago Mr Barroso put forward a candidate who was out of step with European attitudes and values . #% Taxation , particularly any form of harmonisation , is always a sensitive issue . #% Finally , I would like to thank Stephen Hughes for saying that he is in full agreement of an oral amendment , which I believe the rapporteur will also support , concerning the importance of elderly people , which I will be proposing later this morning . #% Subsequently , many thousands of citizens of Azad Jammu and Kashmir have held meetings and pledged their full support for the report . #% Both reports are also too prescriptive on the treatment of victims and witnesses , and fail to take differing national arrangements into account . #% Now the Republic , with its new President Mr Thabo Mbeki , faces new challenges which , in my view , require sustained partnership with the European Union . #% How close does the Commissioner believe we are to achieving 100 % safety testing in the Member States ? #% I wonder whether the Commissioner could indicate or confirm that he will be taking these specific strategic needs into account . #% Tomorrow we will have a trialogue and , hopefully , we will try to get an agreement on a draft declaration . #% The USA has no interest in or concerns about the EU . #% I believe the initial proposal of 5.2 % is far too high . #% There was only a very brief acknowledgement of the need to review implementation issues : that was a key agenda issue for the developing countries going into Doha . #% A few years ago no one used air conditioning -- I have never bought a car with air conditioning . #% I am grateful also that we have been able to ensure that we have parliamentary representation on the board . #% A joint investigation team will take the talent and ability from different Member States and join them together for a purpose which is clearly defined and with a clear termination date , but in a way which will allow that expertise to work effectively and sharply in dealing with criminality and with bringing criminals to book . #% But please involve us in the future and understand that in times of difficulty this dialogue could be critical to the way in which European citizens accept the institutions of the European Union when difficult decisions have to be taken . #% These amendments ensure that decisions on transfers of asylum seekers will have suspensive effect . #% Californian venture capitalists expect nine out of ten investments to fail . #% This is an important point : the liberalisation of the energy sector , one of the last components of the single market yet to be subject to single-market disciplines , is a legislative process . #% Like Mr Miller , I do not believe there should be a piecemeal approach to this but nevertheless if extra money was forthcoming from the Commission or elsewhere to take account of this fact , I am sure it would not be refused by the regions concerned . #% But we have found it because other lines have been able to be pilfered for it . #% I believe that is absolutely right , but could you confirm to me and colleagues whether , in making that remark , you feel that you are just saying that on behalf of the Presidency , or are you speaking on behalf of the Council as a whole ? #% Mr President , I have been a Member of this House for 14 years . #% Secondly , I note your statement that this procedure will start on time on 3 December . #% Having seen off the opposition , the government is able to implement policies to crush all dissent , whether in East Timor where a third of the population have died since the unlawful invasion of 1975 or elsewhere . #% There is nothing incompatible in defending the independence of the bank . #% It can be cured , it can be treated and millions of our fellow citizens can lead full and fulfilled lives if we ... #% But I regret that not more members of the committee felt able to visit Britain to witness the level of progress and the achievements which have been made over the last ten months . #% He deserves our support . #% What airlines need to remember is that there are other stakeholders , not just them , that will be affected by this suspension . #% That is also the primary reason for my not accepting the amendments tabled in the name of the PPE , although I also have difficulties with the content of one or two of them . #% Amendment No 8 draws attention to the need to secure the wide dissemination of information concerning financial assistance , especially to women entrepreneurs , and Amendment No 11 calls for an assessment of the schemes which takes into account equal opportunities . #% For example , fish processors are covered by the first directive but those engaged in fishing as such by the second . #% There are 20 million unemployed across the European Union . #% I support the rejection and I request the Commission to come back with a better proposal that takes account of the Lisbon Treaty , takes account of codecision , takes account of simplicity and effectiveness in monitoring and is consistent with the Commission 's and Parliament 's responsibilities in other areas . #% These issues should be resolved by sensible negotiation between national government and fishermen , not by an unelected bureaucracy with an absolutely appalling track record for environmental vandalism . #% So , I urge the House to stick to the line that we have set in the past in asking for opening up of this market . #% Unfortunately , the Council is not quite so agreeable . #% So why is this not happening ? #% I suggest that this would be a vast improvement in this building . #% Only five Member States have so far ratified that , and it seems appropriate at this moment to call for wider ratification among accession countries and others as a matter of urgency . #% The case of Mr Duvanov , sentenced to three and a half years in jail is well known and has been mentioned . #% 
In my view systems of mutual recognition are more attractive . #% We want to rule out the sale of human tissues for cash , but leave the door open for limited financial compensation for the donor . #% I would ask that your office help us to urgently respond and to show how this institution can be a defender and fighter for our citizens ' rights where wrongs have taken place , particularly in an area which is part of the single market and European citizenship . #% I am not naive . #% Export refunds will help the market by assisting producers to find new markets outside the EU . #% If the EU had any decency , there would be referenda on the Lisbon Treaty and none of it would ever come into force . #% The rapporteur is to be congratulated for bringing it together . #% It started out as a remarkably weak proposal , the key element of which was to set targets for 2010 for the maximum number of exceedances above WHO guidelines , but these targets would not have been binding on Member States . #% That is not what I have been hearing . #% Let us hope we can . #% He was quite right to point out that this proposal is a reallocation of an existing budget and is not about raising the total budget . #% Mr President , I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his report and for the constructive and comprehensive way in which he has tackled this very sensitive and controversial issue . #% His police and militia start attacking anyone they see as opponents . #% It is almost impossible to talk about Ukraine without reference to nuclear power . #% The figures provided by the Afghan Government have been unintentionally misleading to the international community . #% For colleagues whose constituencies are landlocked I offer the following analogy : supposing for good environmental reasons , such as a drastic cut in CO2 omissions , road haulage operators were told by the EU that they could only use their lorries for two weeks out of every four , and then only on condition that a significant proportion of the vehicles were taken off the road altogether . #% This is not just a question of controlling these plants by one particular means - there are other means to controls these plants as well . #% In reality hundreds of people died in Cuban prisons in the early years of the revolution , and many more have been imprisoned or had their lives ruined for daring to speak the truth . #% My understanding was that there was an intention to run one . #% It would be a tragic wasted opportunity if the reinforced UNIFIL merely became a bystander while Hizbollah prepares for its next attacks in the months and years ahead . #% It does not stop there : they repeat it time and again , on the same licence , citing this bogus technical problem several times over -- and one wonders why fish stocks are depleted ! #% With this revised framework agreement , the Commission itself becomes much more parliamentary in character than it has been in the past . #% Economic growth remains extremely weak , and many people have lost faith in the idea of an early recovery . #% I sense that there is some reluctance to fully involve this House in the Northern Dimension . #% There were a large number of British soldiers in the Balkan War and , of course in the Gulf , and as a British Conservative I will say this : Of course , we are concerned about the possible impact of the use of depleted uranium , but against the background of Mr Solana 's statement , we do not believe that NATO should adopt a moratorium on the use of such weapons . #% Reflecting the helpful opinion we received from the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities , the report advocates the integration of a gender dimension throughout the strategy and highlights a number of specific strands of work to be tackled . #% The awesome pictures of that mighty sea consuming the land and crushing people , homes and landmarks were terrifying and terrible . #% I believe we should work together , but I say to the Americans that this is our neighbourhood . #% As the Parliament ' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report , Mr Kinnock , I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process , and if I may say to all colleagues here , we have a very important task to do , which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness . #% We have 62 priorities in this splendid new document . #% As previous speakers have outlined , the timetable that has been agreed is based on the package adopted in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , Euro 5 and Euro 6 coming into force in 2009 and 2014 respectively . #% Mr President , Mrs Roth-Behrendt quoted from Shakespeare in her contribution and I would like to quote from Hamlet ' s soliloquy : whether it is nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or by opposing end them . #% This debate is also an illustration of the importance of the Commission carrying out extensive consultation in advance of publishing its proposals . #% In English we say `` two heads are better than one '' . #% We have often debated these problems in the past , but quite rightly do so again tonight : 36.1 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in this world , tuberculosis is making a tragic comeback , 300 million people suffer the debilitating and painful effects of malaria . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by just reminding the House of a few statistics . #% Perhaps even Macdonald 's might be forced to protest . #% As to my tactics , I was not really sure what I should do . #% Equally , it is right to believe some of the bad things we are told about China , but it is not right to believe of them , without the evidence necessary . #% We also need to take responsibility for the state of the world in which those children are growing up , not least the environmental conditions under which many of them have to suffer . #% But it is very much more hope than anything else . #% I would therefore urge the Lithuanian authorities to reflect on the fact that the EU is committed to preventing the marginalisation , vilification and persecution of minorities that was so commonplace throughout Europe for the first half of the 20th century . #% You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening . #% Certainly I am dubious that national or European civil servants are capable of judging what makes a good film and whether public money should be spent on one film or another . #% The widespread removal of tropical timber is driven by an insatiable appetite for products to grace our homes . #% I think if we miss Copenhagen , we will not miss it for a week or a month or a couple of months , we will miss enlargement for a whole generation . #% In our debates we have a better balance of speakers from the floor and fewer long speeches from the platform , and we are of a mind that we should do more to support the new pan-African Parliament , perhaps with exchange of personnel . #% We must see safeguarding measures brought in to prevent a flood of cheap imports from damaging our own industry . #% My sources said that he had no defence counsel whatsoever . #% In addition , for the first time in the Commission 's report they also highlight the fact that the European Union is largely an internal trading community . #% I am sure Mr Duff will correct me if I got the figure slightly wrong . #% So , I shall state quite simply and briefly what my own message to the Commission and Council would be : please give your encouragement and support to the creation and development of women 's networks , at both domestic and pan-European levels . #% If that prudential plus approach is used , then we may as well not have a pensions directive in Europe . #% However , it is important that the legislation be workable and enforceable , not only simply , but also consistently across the EU . #% Nuclear energy springs to my mind in that context . #% It allows us to move forward but still leaves this discussion open for us to reach a sensible conclusion to that debate . #% First of all , the tax-payer does not pay for it . #% Mr President , this report should be welcomed for its well-rounded approach . #% One should ask why the Commission , at this sensitive moment , has seen fit to cut the budget in half , but what we really need is a political Commission , a campaigning Commission that will complement the role of the European Council to bring real leadership to the European citizen . #% In the Forest of Dean , which I represent , 40 years ago elvers ( glass eels ) were fished in abundance by the local population and sold on the streets for consumption as part of a traditional breakfast with bacon and eggs . #% Although composting has been a Cinderella activity in the past , we need to give further assistance to that and encourage its development at local and regional level . #% Mr President , I voted against Amendment No 5 to the Lannoye report because of assurances given by the Commission that it was not factually correct and that it had not asked developing countries for binding commitments in relation to privatising their water industry . #% In particular , some important elements have been introduced and a number should be mentioned . #% The agreement therefore applies to international maritime cargo transport on logistic services between the ports in China and the Member States and indeed international maritime cargo transport between the ports of the EU . #% We also believe that women must be protected from violent acts and those responsible for such acts should face the full force of the law . #% Fair shares for all under the CFP , do I hear ? #% 
Mr President , I will be brief in saying that my Group had two fundamental objectives in dealing with this proposal from the Commission . #% We have seen some budget lines sacrificed so that we could go for this strategy ; we have seen some lines take decreases and some lines disappear , where some of our colleagues were asking us to maintain them or indeed increase them . #% We have had a one-sided debate here about the Constitution . #% There are actions that can be taken : they are laid down in the European Convention against Trafficking , amongst other documents . #% The people who write them fear that they will no longer be able to buy over 300 food supplements that their good health depends on . #% That would be a good way forward and my group would be prepared to support such a move . #% There is also the recurring difficulty on the oceans of the world of flags of convenience - vessels that are fishing very much for their own convenience and their own economic gain under the flag of some nation that has little control in terms of the fishing that takes place . #% Would you now like to take the opportunity to say something about Poland ? #% It is a challenge born less out of crisis and more out of evolutionary progress '' . #% I am sure the Commission would have benefited from that . #% Therefore , it reduces bureaucratic burdens on EU citizens and marks a practical step in making a reality of living in Europe and crossing boundaries . #% Roads are , and always will be , the cornerstone of our transport industry , allowing us to reach every corner of our respective countries and the whole of our continent . #% I am glad that there are already three further countries -- Spain , Portugal and Finland -- which have said that they will be removing the barriers . #% Second , could he tell us how he could make such a promise when year after year the Commission proposes funding interventions in Central and Eastern Europe and in the former Yugoslavia at the expense of budget lines benefiting the developing countries . #% But at least as importantly , it provided some parliamentary input into the ASEM process , which culminates later in the year with the Copenhagen meeting . #% Mr President , you said the trade unions have been consulted . #% As I speak , many thousands of my own countrymen and women are putting their lives at risk to free a people from tyranny . #% On the margin , there are some areas - for example the attendance of veterinarians , fallen stock , etc. where there might be too much regulation . #% Without legal means , many people resort to dangerous and illegal ways of circumventing frontiers . #% In many cases a better solution is to change the road surface and not the tyre standards . #% Madam President , on the point about the interinstitutional agreement , I should like to ask the Commissioner by whose authority the interinstitutional agreement by which there was an advisory committee , established between Parliament , the Commission , the Council of Europe and the G24 , was unilaterally abrogated on 9 January this year . #% That is continuing evidence -- as if we needed it -- of the determination of the Sudanese Government to harass human rights defenders and arbitrarily arrest , without trial , people who have the audacity to speak out . #% Particular attention must also be paid to the reform of public administration and the fight against corruption , including delivery on the promise of indictments of high-level officials alleged to have committed serious offences . #% Let us get it right , working in harmony with the United States and other allies - and all the time remember why we are there . #% The final point concerns the use of medicines for equine species . #% Only if we get that shall we be doing our job as a Parliament and acting in the spirit of what President Santer said yesterday in his speech of repentance and contrition . #% We may have to do that because , if we do not , we send a message to those who would follow Saddam Hussein that they can get away with it , and we send an even worse message to the great nation of the United States which has stood by this continent in good times and in bad that it is on its own . #% The decision we made in committee , just a couple weeks ago , about whether ferrets should be included on the list and have passports or not , was one of the most difficult that I have ever made . #% Will you therefore ask the President of Parliament to further consider these allegations by Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre and ask that Member either to produce evidence , should any exist , or , if not , to conduct himself in a manner more appropriate to a politician with pretensions to legal objectivity . #% That , I believe , takes away from the strength of our argument when we are talking about human rights abuses in other parts of the world . #% Let us in Europe say to those local people today : you shall no longer choose between speaking out in fear or dying in silence . #% Flexibility and adaptability are vital in the face of mutating threats . #% I make no secret of my opposition to dialogue with the terrorists of Hamas , an organisation committed to Israel 's annihilation , but , if we are ever to deal with Hamas , it must only be after Gilad Shalit has been liberated from his squalid captivity . #% In March , her husband died of cancer . #% In addition , we understand the Council wishes to amend this document and , therefore , we do not see why we , as parliamentarians , should not also have that right . #% The new Commission has been slow in acknowledging this , but there is much joy in heaven for the repentant sinner even when it comes later rather than sooner . #% We appreciated that global terrorism , a terrorism well-financed and organised with no clear political objective beyond creating chaos , required a new approach to security . #% We are simply saying , over time you need to have the right to review this , to take another view once it is general use and is part of that great experiment among the population . #% On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP . #% How should that work be organised ? #% When they join , as they will on 1 January , they should have the same rights as everyone else . #% What about the principles ? #% Firstly by the behaviour and crowd-control skills of cabin crew during emergency evacuations , and , secondly , by passengers ' knowledge of safety procedures and their motivation to get acquainted with them . #% In order to benefit fully from this situation the Commission has launched a call for an expression of interest for the provision of office space . #% But further work needs to be done . #% However , this raises the question of what constitutes sufficient information , and whether account will be taken of the differences between prevailing practices in Member States , or at least whether potential investors will be alerted to the differences that may exist in areas in which they are not comparing like with like . #% in writing . - We want a pragmatic European Commission that will push through reform , including deregulation and reductions in EU expenditure , focusing on managerial issues rather than political integration . #% As the rapporteur on the Regulation on Access to Documents , I feel it only right to point out that in the judgment of 16 February 2000 , the European Court of Human Rights confirmed its earlier case law , that it is data relating to the private life of an individual that falls within the scope of Article 8 . #% Yet I do not see a directive before us to require alcohol to be submitted to all sorts of safety tests , or for bottles of Guinness or Strasbourg wine to carry the strongest possible health warnings . #% I welcome the call , in the resolution , for the Commission to explain to Parliament 's Committee on Budgets in more detail exactly how we are helping in Iraq and how we are aiming to support those surrounding countries . #% I invite him , as a last clarion call , to repeat that inhumane treatment in mental health is not to be tolerated in this Union . #% A free trade agreement with India must be central to the Commission 's new global Europe strategy . #% I am one of those who believe that such injustices as poverty , homelessness and unemployment are denials and abuses of human rights . #% We defend public service obligations - however the service concerned may be financed - and the principles of universal access , which constantly come back in all of our debates now about technology . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the European Commission has already tried to create an EU patent law , but failed in June when this was rejected by the Council , which failed to achieve a unanimous vote . #% There are many more examples of the way in which these guidelines produced by the Commission were changed . #% It is going to put them at a disadvantage . #% So I pay tribute to him for so graphically making the case for action in this area . #% I supported the tabling of amendments to exempt part-time stand-by boilers from the scope of the directive . #% As a member of the Convention , I made great efforts to try to persuade my colleagues that the emerging draft was wrong for Europe in principle and wrong for Europe 's citizens . #% We would like to see the Commission look into that aspect , and into the question of time off for activities in the works councils , which varies from Member State to Member State . #% However , it would send a very damaging signal to these two countries , both of which have bent over backwards to accommodate the Union 's advice and requirements in a spirit of real partnership and openness . #% Under Rule 19 ( 4 ) , may I ask you to personally intervene with the Greek authorities on behalf of my constituents Paul and Lesley Coppin of Mildenhall , and Anna Skinner of Epping , in relation to her brother Anthony Adamiak , and on behalf of the other Europeans who are currently in jail in Greece for plane spotting . #% Ban on British beef - Production and sale of tobacco #% I ask you - and I echo Mr Watson 's point of order - to take those points back to your President and co-Vice-Presidents and ask them to be much tougher . #% However , can we press the Commission to draw up a trade and cooperation agreement with the SAR of Hong Kong as soon as possible ? #% 
This is not because we do not want these countries to enter , it is not because we are dissatisfied with the negotiations , and it is most certainly not because we have found some bureaucratic institutional or technical arguments to reconsider our previous commitments to the enlargement process . #% We are actually referring to Senator Jesse Helms who normally shoots from the hip , but not with a gun . #% Unfortunately , this new requirement for new buildings will not help us with the 20-20-20 targets , especially because , increasingly , we realise that we need to be looking at at least a 30 % greenhouse gas emission reduction . #% It might be better to have an overall EU recycling target at EU level and let market forces determine which recycling facilities can achieve the objective in the most cost-effective manner . ' #% In fact , debt cancellation needs to go hand-in-hand with an increase in aid and the ALDE resolution includes a renewed pledge that Member States give 0.7 % of GDP as overseas development assistance . #% Only by a united EU approach can we tackle the increasing counterfeit products available to the public - available not only through the shop floor , but via distribution services such as the Internet . #% However , as the proposed resolution lays down , that relationship is not always a comfortable one . #% Mr Carswell , the petitioner in this case , was one of them . #% There are , of course , other areas of concern , including child welfare and the support for and integration of the Roma communities . #% When people are fleeing for their lives across the world and when democratically elected politicians are in fear of their lives , Europe needs to make a response that this is not acceptable . #% It did get a bad press - in some respects deservedly - but those who say an international conference on racism was not worth holding are wrong . #% I support Mr Wynn 's report , and my group supports it too . #% And we are working in a tough and dangerous situation . #% We in this House should show a little more gratitude and a little less criticism . #% It matters for the Congolese , who have waited 40 years for democratic elections and who turned out in great numbers on 30 July , but it matters globally too . #% There is greater emphasis on organic production throughout Europe . #% It is for this reason that we are requesting that the Commission produce implementation guidelines to aid employers ' understanding of the risks and necessary preventative measures to ensure a consistent application of the directive . #% After 1 July Hong Kong will be governed under the principle of one country , two systems , and logically therefore Hong Kong has to be discussed in its own right and must not be used by people as a sort of Trojan horse to discuss and criticize China . #% Whether Member States want to preserve a monopoly or not , the fact is that consumers are taking advantage of online gambling . #% Conflict goes on for years . #% The Prime Minister of Macedonia wondered who would invest , build and hire new people in a country with constant shootings , a country in one third of whose territory travel after dark is not recommended . #% Finally , there are a number of national consultation processes going on in the Member States on GM crops . #% There are murky links between organised criminals and political extremists and in a neighbouring country , as we have just heard , the murder of Prime Minister Djindjic may be evidence of those links . #% I will leave the rest to the rapporteurs . #% Such a thing is a contradiction in terms since the Net is a shop window at every terminal link to the network and , to argue in some contrived way , that a site can be directed at some and not others is linguistically facile , commercially nonsensical and technologically illiterate . #% Many MEPs have raised cases from their constituencies and those cases are increasing . #% We have had far too much unaccountable and interfering government from this place over the years . #% As regards charges , in the case of this particular proposal , whilst it is true that different charges being levied in different countries is a distortion of the free market , common charges would not reflect the differences in cost of inspections in , for example , Lithuania as opposed to Germany . #% We believe the lack of transparency and lack of harmonisation on infrastructure charges is leading to a protectionist practice and is acting as a break on delivering the single market to the railway sector , as well as stifling cross-border activity . #% The previous speaker said in a few days ; it was actually in August the decision was taken . #% As these two approaches are made , this two-pronged approach by the European Union and the United States is , in my view , the best way to start the process for long-term peace and stability in this region . #% It is in that context that we have to see our debate today . #% I told her so , and the Irish government so when I was the Northern Ireland Minister responsible for Energy and I reiterate that view now . #% We must promote better understanding of our common problems and , indeed , find common solutions to them across the European Union , but on the basis of consensus and mutual understanding . #% It is difficult to predict the effects of this for two sectors that are so closely related to one another . #% Family and working life balance has to do with the social and psychological wellbeing of all workers within the European Union . #% Trade - free trade - is an important motor for the global economy and it is something we must support . #% In particular , Member States must stop dragging their feet . #% Similarly , payment of position premiums for functions that carry particularly heavy responsibility and/or workload is gradually becoming the norm in labour markets throughout the European Union . #% in writing . - British Conservatives share to some extent the concerns in this report that there are serious civil liberties issues about some abuses in the practice of carrying out profiling in a small minority of cases , and welcomes the fact that the European Parliament is seeking to draw this to the attention of Member State governments . #% I am sure that colleagues here are aware that the Commission came back with a series of responses to those questions which , to my Group , were satisfactory enough for us to grant discharge . #% Madam President , I would like to be clear that if we have agreed that Zimbabwe would be the fifth point then there is no point in voting in any other points because we already have five points on the agenda . #% It is the height of hypocrisy to come here and accuse the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of taking its time on it . #% This is a very important provision which I am sure will have the support of all colleagues . #% We must not lose sight of it because otherwise we will never have peace in the long-term . #% Baroness Ashton ran CND and still refuses to tell us whether she took money from the Communist Party of Great Britain . #% My Group does not believe that economic growth automatically produces significant employment , nor does it automatically produce sustainable development . #% The Berlin speeches by Foreign Minister Fischer , visionary and controversial , by President Chirac , controversial but not visionary , and by Prime Minister Blair , neither visionary nor controversial , which threaten to overshadow the memory of the Portuguese Presidency , leave certain questions in the mind which the Portuguese Presidency can still help us with . #% I am sure my colleagues Mr Bourlanges and Mr Virrankoski will add to my comments . #% I am sure the President understands the distress the families of the murdered men are experiencing , caused by the lengthy and drawn-out proceedings for the retrial , which have only added to their original grief over this matter . #% Firstly we are calling on the Commission to undertake research on a gender-free job evaluation scheme and to prepare model job evaluation guidelines for use as a bench mark by the social partners . #% The inclusion of IUU fishing in the Commission 's work programme for this year is very welcome , but we need a clear timetable in this regard . #% I am very concerned also about the workability of the compulsory financial security , whether it is in the form of insurance , bonds or other forms of security . #% Yes , everyone should be warned about the dangers of the sun , but that should not be up to employers . #% I hope that enough scientists will want to brave the dark winters of Finland in order to ensure the European Chemicals Agency is the success we hope it will prove . #% So why should this be any different ? #% I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague , Michele Schreyer , to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning : `` Reforming the Commission '' . #% Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea 's power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential . #% That is why the movement 's campaign for an anti-discrimination clause in the revised Maastricht Treaty and one with a right of appeal to the European Court is our most urgent demand and the most important duty over the next six months for all of us who support disabled people 's human rights . #% Let us be clear about what a future strategy must contain . #% Greek rescue teams were among the first to provide assistance in Turkey , a very positive and humane gesture that was reciprocated by Turkey when not long after Athens too fell victim to earthquakes . #% Iraqi people are highly talented , most able and , until Saddam Hussein took over , they had a high standard of education and health and some democracy . #% The Maternity Directive , the Parental Leave Directive and the Part-Time Work Directive are all good examples of the European Union 's commitment to supporting both women and men in their role as parents . #% Voters can not , therefore , be expected to make an informed choice between candidates of the same party . #% Is he aware that Aung San Suu Kyi , the leader of the democratic opposition in Burma , has called for practical economic measures , which , she says , is the only way that we will see political change in her country ? #% There is nothing inevitable about all the concerns raised in Mr Deva 's report . #% 
So we are extremely concerned about this and the effects that this directive might have on what is still a new scheme in London but one that has been extremely successful . #% To have any effect on meeting our climate change targets , it is existing buildings that we need to concentrate on and the energy efficiency requirements there . #% Europe can not be constructed without clear , liberal and social values , strong rules and robust parliamentary democracy . #% We have a relatively small number in the European Union . #% As you will all agree , this programme is not only another piece of legislation ; it is a significant signal to Europe 's freight businesses that we can , and indeed we want , to help rather than hinder them . #% There was a spirit of hope abroad in that country . #% There are many points of detail in the report which are particularly controversial , not least the idea of European Union embassies and the suggestion that the European Union should have `` coordinated representation in international bodies such as the UN '' . #% We think that this proposal should be seen and implemented as part of the whole package of measures that the EU is engaged in to encourage employment , education and training . #% There is no confidence that the constitution will be applied properly and will be observed . #% In that process , we had a two-day hearing organised by the Commission and the previous Presidency on how this could or could not be achieved . #% What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries ? #% In other words , a standard piece of give and take , the kind of thing that until a few years ago , until we had the present Commission and the present Parliament , was not possible . #% My committee considers it important to give a positive response to this Commission proposal , which strives to make the recognition and enforcement of judgments between Member States almost automatic . #% However , in terms of the technical conduct of the elections , I want to emphasise the incredible commitment to the process shown by the mainly young polling officials . #% I heard Mrs Gill talking about the way in which the consumer was going to benefit . #% The fact that the EU is seeking to extend its powers into areas hitherto reserved for Member States exclusively shows the true aim of the EU : to create a federal superstate . #% I think he deserves a special mention this evening . #% I shall finish by saying that the Council , Commission and Parliament must speak with one voice . #% The quota system is complex and would only have worked very well with a company that had a range of products which fitted conveniently into these 20 % steps . #% There is an additional responsibility in this regard where we have concluded fisheries partnership agreements with them . #% That does not mean that Mrs Cresson must write a book about ICT , but that the European Union should play an active role in developing ICT . #% We believe that this particular piece of legislation is unnecessary , highly excessive and has little relevance to the needs of business and employees alike . #% Mozambique is , of course , one of the poorest countries in the world , but one of Africa ' s great success stories with its work on economic growth , on poverty reduction , on democracy in spite , of course , of massive debt pressures . #% We must certainly try to recycle more PVC . #% The real problem , in my view , is in Laos , which is an authoritarian and essentially unreformed regime , where there are limits on freedom of expression , freedom of the press , freedom of association and freedom of religion and there is no effective political opposition . #% They want to be included in the Commission 's emission trading scheme , and you may ask why . #% This is the theme , or one of the major themes , of the report I shall produce for this Parliament in May . #% In that regard I would like specifically to refer to the issues of external relations , the international financial crisis and the negotiations within the World Trade Organisation . #% It was not the intention of this amendment to wreck the directive . #% It consists of many small enterprises and enthusiasts . #% So there is a danger that despite a general willingness to conclude at the December European Council , we end up , as in Nice , with it going on long into the night with last-minute deals cobbled together . #% We are not trying to harmonise cultures but to find ways of working together whilst keeping our various identities . #% The Charter of Fundamental Rights which I helped to prepare states that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her and the Amsterdam Treaty called for the establishment of an independent supervisor by 1 January , 1999 . #% I welcome the work of Member States towards a UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons , reminding Parliament that the definition includes things like shoulder-carried , anti-aircraft missiles . #% The black economy is largely a cash economy . #% However , it is quite serious when somebody who is democratically elected as the Mayor of , I would say , Europe 's premier city , finds himself wishing to cosy up to someone who is not only populist but increasingly authoritarian . #% For that reason , it is right for the French Government to highlight the importance of giving aid to the Maghreb countries , many of whose citizens are settled in London , which I represent , as migrants or refugees . #% I would like to depart from the political pyrotechnics of some of the previous interventions and focus on the subject at hand today -- the annual legislative programme . #% On investment again , in Great Yarmouth a campaign for more than a decade to build an outer harbour would see this put in competition with the existing inner harbour , substituting existing jobs rather than expanding jobs and services in an area recognised as a priority to tackle unemployment in the whole of the European Union . #% Available scientific evidence on deep-water species suggests that they are outside safe biological limits and that measures should be introduced to allow rebuilding of the stocks . #% A further innovation this year was the introduction of some analysis of where EU action has worked well and , indeed , where there were gaps in our performance . #% The importance of this has been underlined by the previous speakers . #% That is why people like Nigel Farage and UKIP have consistently opposed Plan D , the funding of it and its stimulation of debates about Europe . #% When Alex Smith and myself delivered the documents on disappeared people in Sri Lanka , only four people in the United Nations were working on disappearances for the whole world . #% It would help though , when we investigate this matter , if it could be established when Mrs Baldi actually left Parliament so that we can be sure that every single vote in this Parliament today , bar the vote on Amendment No 13 , has been above-board . #% But it would be a tragedy if it was spoiled by one amendment , an amendment which exacerbated the known shortages of rare blood groups and plasma . #% I also want to talk about the United Nations . #% To make matters even worse : in Northampton , alone , the area that was affected was a socially deprived one where people basically have very little insurance coverage . #% Mr President , I would like to draw attention to a matter which is of direct relevance to this House , namely the situation of near anarchy that exists around the entrances to the Channel Tunnel at present at the freight depot . #% Mr President , though a flabby pinstriped businessman who enjoys shooting driven game , I want to concentrate on the aspect that we have 17 hygiene directives here being deregulated into one . #% To pretend , as the Labour Government in Britain is already doing , that this Convention is simply an opportunity to limit the power of the Union at the expense of the states is ridiculous . #% This is why the Safe Action for Europe project , which unfortunately can not get past the question of a legal base , would have been quite appropriate for small businesses . #% To allow the European Parliament to vote for Turkey 's accession when the time comes , reformers in Europe and Turkey must work together to lobby for change , as the Commissioner advised . #% Other changes might be needed . #% We reiterate our view that the Commission is right to focus on fewer projects but we oppose the fact that the Commission is now planning to make a EUR 60 billion addition to the trans-European network transport budget line . #% I do not have the exact details concerning the matter you referred to . #% We are looking at huge costs , huge damage to the industry - especially to small businesses - and huge damage to European competitiveness . #% Unfortunately I have not seen a great deal of evidence that Member States have really taken that on board and I hope that will be picked up in the Commission . #% We have to stop ignoring the wishes of the Palestinian people . #% What nonsense to say that this new Constitution will create a centralised superstate ! #% For example , partners would continue to have access to established language courses where places are available . #% There is a danger that these potentially misleading claims could result in an increase in formula milk being given to children who could lose out on vital nutrients , such as DHA , that are found naturally in breast milk . #% Madam President , we have indeed been set challenges by our two rapporteurs , but I would like to focus on three issues in particular : enlargement , Commission reform and , last but not least , Iraq . #% Mr President , ASEAN is growing up fast and fraternal Europe has just started to notice this precocious , younger brother whose family ties to Europe , whether political , economic or cultural , are strengthening daily . #% This Parliament should pay tribute to Morgan Tsvangirai , the MDC activists and all those who have had the courage to stand up to Mugabe for all this time . #% Is the Presidency aware of the long history of this issue in that this Parliament has pressed for the Council to meet in public when acting as a legislature ever since it was first elected in 1979 ? #% 
in writing . - I supported this Interim Economic Partnership Agreement with Papua New Guinea and Fiji as it is important to develop strong links with exporting countries in the Pacific Region . #% The report made in 2002 on the subject of Arab human development was described by magazine as the most important publication of the year , and more than a million people downloaded it from the UNDP website . #% Mr von Wogau deserves much praise for drawing to a conclusion the lengthy negotiations that we have had on this important issue . #% Surely the President-in-Office can think of some better causes - if the finance ministers have extra money at their disposal - than a tax break for the tobacco industry and the alcohol industry . #% The movement of uranium away from the test-firing location by tides and currents could not , therefore , be distinguished from natural background concentrations . #% These are the key reforms , boldly and rightly set out by President Barroso in the programme for his Commission , but already I fear this opportunity may be slipping from our grasp . #% Last December 's elections predictably delivered an overwhelming majority for Heydar Aliyev 's New Azerbaijan Party . #% We were told to arrive here for votes at noon . #% There will be no level playing field if these standards are absent . #% In the case of many chemicals on the market at the moment , we quite simply do not know how dangerous or how safe they are . #% This would be by way of an additional activity that is within our powers to undertake . #% It must be possible to get EU-wide agreement on the core issue of preventing the day-to-day racial harassment and hatred suffered by many of our citizens and residents . #% I know that is covered by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , but we must find a way of bringing together what we are doing in the Committee on Civil Liberties and the Subcommittee on Human Rights . #% It has many defects . #% I am not sure about this and I want to return to it in an explanation of vote . #% As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions , we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed . #% It is essential that the opt-out be retained , in particular for certain occupations . #% It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service . #% The Socialist Group has been consistent in its line on Turkey 's application for membership of the EU . #% Banning the promotion or propagation of homosexuality is likely to have a chilling effect on free speech and discussions , as the Fundamental Rights Agency has pointed out . #% President Prodi said that the deliberations were taken in the full light of day - but not the meetings of the Praesidium , nor the private meetings between Giscard d'Estaing and some Heads of Government , nor the leaks to Le Monde , putting very extreme positions from which Giscard d'Estaing could then be seen to negotiate to merely difficult or mildly impossible positions . #% I believe the Commission listened to us quite carefully on this recent package , although not , I regret to say , on the proposals regarding mutuals and the European Statute for Associations . #% Just two weeks ago our delegation heard Prime Minister Haniyeh not only convince us in a way that satisfied us all that the unity government was determined to meet the Quartet 's three principles , and believed it was doing so , but also that it would meet with members of the Quartet without reservation or precondition at any time to try to sort out these differences . #% But we shall leave that to one side . #% Of course , paragraph 13 records what was agreed , not what was not agreed . #% I entirely concur with all the conclusions in it , but I particularly call for an article on disability rights in the Treaty . #% What happened is a disgrace to you and your institution . #% This morning I chaired a press conference here on the subject of burdens on business . #% Indeed , over the next ten years , employment in this industry is set to increase by a massive 15 % . #% That constricted timing has meant that there are one or two areas , as my colleague has just indicated , where we might have liked to tighten things up a little more but have not been able to . #% Universities have shared information with each other for centuries , before the EU existed . #% We are in favour of the continued presence of such weapons as they contribute to burden-sharing and guaranteeing US military commitment to European security . #% . I reject the need for EU legislation in this field since it should be the responsibility of the individual member states to decide how best to ensure port security . #% The only problem with this is that the action is then quite disproportionate to the risk , and sets a thoroughly bad precedent for future European Union action in relation to the chemicals we use . #% Mr President , like Mr Evans , I am concerned with the safety of passengers , but I will be talking to the Parodi report . #% I received , I suppose , what has been the most complicated April Fool 's Day hoax in the form of what purports to be a report to the European Parliament from the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions , a report that would have us believe that something like ECU 36 million is going to be spent on converting the Belliard I and II buildings to meet their purpose . #% We want a monetary policy that will help to promote employment and growth within the European Union . #% Though this risk is considered remote , the committee thought the risk was unacceptable and recommended that the gene be excised before the maize could be used as animal feed . #% Over the years the victims of terrorism have numbered tens of thousands . #% What is very clear in this proposal and many others is that we have less and less time , not only the self-imposed target date for liberalization , but less and less time for this industry in Europe to be able to survive and compete with the United States of America and Japan . #% In fact , the proposals from President Santer were a mere shadow of what the Commission had originally envisaged because the Commission knew what was achievable . #% We need it , but it must bring clear benefits and not losses . #% However , in Vietnam , for instance , citizens are still being persecuted for their religious beliefs and practices . #% Colleagues , vote for all of Mr Moscovici 's report , but reject the amendments . #% Indeed , fishers may become pioneers in the area as happened in Scotland with the square mesh panel . #% The Commission proposal in line with previous consumer protection legislation took the view in dealing with Article 15 that all such disputes should go to the consumer ' s court whilst willing to defer to a general proposition that contracts concluded at a distance should fall under this category . #% The findings of the report make extremely alarming reading . #% There are no smiles on the faces of the gay men and boys of Egypt who have been harassed and their homes raided , and who have been entrapped via the Internet on trumped-up charges . #% That is why tonight we call for a tightening of the rules , not against the people in the mafia-style gangs , but the men in the sharp suits and with the briefcases who are behind this $ 500 billion drugs trade worldwide . #% Mr Cunha 's report would probably mean a second reform and we could not accept it . #% The House will know that the Kingdom of the Netherlands is at present the only European Union Member State where marriage between two people of the same gender is legally provided for . #% With me today in the public gallery is a mother of two from Earls Barton near Wellingborough whose eldest son is due to enter secondary education in September . #% Do you know anything about the emergency 112 number ? #% One would hope that it would never have to go that far , but that route is available to somebody who is dissatisfied . #% I hope that people will vote in support of my amendments and oppose the European tax . #% This House has already adopted Mrs Carrère d'Encausse 's report on Transcaucasia , which provided the background for the PCAs with three out of the four countries we are dealing with today . #% I would remind Members that Council informed the chairman and members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs -- in writing in a letter dated 31 March and indeed verbally after that -- of its agreement to the amendments here proposed to the common position and to the Council statement on taxation to be entered in the Council minutes should agreement be reached on the adoption of the regulation . #% If we do not do that in this very important area , we will have failed . #% Naturally , when I have a proposal to make for new and improved arrangements , I will put them to my colleagues in the Commission and subsequently report them to this House and the other institutions for consideration . #% This debate is myth against reality . #% This leads me on to the important role of the pharmacist in the sale and prescription of over-the-counter medicines . #% We do not want to see this again . #% We have cases changing from one to the other , profiting only the lawyers . #% There is confusion . #% I wish to concentrate on two issues which I know Parliament considers to be of the utmost importance , namely the Galileo project and the future of postal services . #% It seems to me that we must try to continue to enlarge this budget line and encourage its use by others . #% 
So , press ahead with the EU Constitution if you must , but be warned : you are fuelling public resentment , which will blow the European construction apart . #% Is this progress ? #% Mr President , in supporting this motion I speak particularly of the need to give financial assistance , both to cushion the socio-economic effects of the measures that have been taken and to help the industry to survive until the stocks have recovered . #% We were deeply unhappy in this House with the Commission text but at least it made some effort to refer to the need to bring unemployment down and to deal with the appalling levels of growth . #% The question is : will this be enough to compensate for the failings of the European Arrest Warrant ? #% I also have to ask why , when the Commission is ambitious enough - quite rightly - to want to reform the whole of European governance , it does not put at the centre of that strategy a radical reworking and modernisation of its communications and information policy . #% In fact , the same could be said for many of the EU 's agencies , which duplicate work done at national level and unashamedly promote the EU 's federalist agenda . #% It regards ESDP as a fundamentally flawed concept , driven by the divisive and mistaken desire to provide the European Union with an autonomous military capability as an aspect of its political ambition to create a European state . #% But the idea in paragraph 51 , indent 5 might give a sensible idea of how to proceed , bringing in national parliaments to make our own resources system more transparent . #% We must be realistic about what is going on in the market-place and what consumers are buying now . #% Mr President , any medicine can be dangerous . #% But what about when abstinence is not a choice ? #% Then the Council sponsored a resolution condemning North Korean human rights in Geneva without informing either the North Koreans or the Commission . #% Mr President , I have a serious complaint : about 15 minutes ago a peaceful protest was about to take place against the Constitution -- a banner was to be unfurled . #% Mr President , I apologise for my lateness . #% Mr President , the development of closer relations between the European Union and Latin America is of great importance . #% As a Parliament , we know that as we put Lisbon into effect , we have to exercise our new powers with discretion and responsibility . #% We need to ensure that there is more diversification on the farm but we also need to ensure there is more diversification within the local economy . #% There is no mention of this in the justification . #% Now we come once more to Burma - another abominable regime - yet another case where the efforts of the European Union and the international community to encourage change have brought few tangible results . #% That , as you have said yourself today , means that you must also identify tasks , policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission 's main vocation . #% I expect better from the President of the Commission . #% There is plenty of basic research and knowledge about parasites and genomes , but there needs to be more bridging research to translate basic research into tested and safe drugs and clinical applications . #% But , to inject a note of optimism , just as I said in the debate in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , one has only to look at the jackets and suits we are all wearing and ask where they were made . #% We can revert to that at a later date . #% If the global authorities will not act , then the EU must be free to introduce its own scheme . #% This might help a lot of people if we could leave on Thursday night instead of Friday . #% We have to ` get real ' about what the Council will do . #% There must be an end to international trade and effective freezing of the bank accounts of Mr Mugabe and his entourage . #% She was generous enough to pay tribute to me and I want to say to her that it has been a pleasure to work with her . #% The closure of units 3 and 4 at Kozloduy should be reassessed in the light of the International Atomic Energy Agency 's conclusion , in its report , issued in June that these units have reached a level of operational safety which corresponds to those of the same age in other parts of the world . #% While it would be totally mistaken to consider returning to closed economies or narrow protectionism , there is a need for agreed international regulation to deter huge and sudden capital flows , particularly of short-term funds , and to work towards globally coordinated interest rates . #% The following are purely illustrative in the limited time available . #% That is why the PSE Group has tried to ensure that we have real focus in the health programme . #% We can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report . #% We should say , when the Commission sends us a proposal -- and this again is a recommendation -- that with each proposal there should be just a short checklist about the procedures that the Commission has already gone through and the ones that it will go through in future . #% I trust that on this basis we can consider that we have a political agreement and that the Commission proposal can go forward for adoption by the Council , as amended following the adoption of Parliament 's opinion . #% Media-Most runs the independent television of Russia and its organisation has a number of radio stations and independent magazines . #% I would be grateful if the rapporteur is able -- as he has kindly indicated that he wishes to do -- to make some small oral amendments to mention justice , security and liberty policies in his excellent report . #% He did not say another word back in the United Kingdom about it . #% The Council should get its act together on the Doha Round and work harder towards world trade agreements . #% Other organizations , like the Yemeni human rights organization , Europa , have produced further evidence , including lists of victims , which can not be disregarded . #% It does function and , as the Commissioner has just said , that is amazing considering all the difficulties . #% The Socialists and the Liberals reneged on their promise . #% The annual report submitted by UNRWA will certainly be provided to Parliament as well as to the Council . #% The question of European defence policy was also addressed by the European Council . #% So there will be a deal over the next couple of days , but it will not settle the matter . #% Nobody seems to care about what is happening here . #% The experts ' group merely proposes an extension to existing UK rules on the purposes for which embryos can be used in research . #% How , then , can objectivity figure when the final objective has already been decided ? #% We have the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we are constructing an area of freedom , security and justice . #% I am delighted to hear that Amendments Nos 32 and 36 have been accepted but we now have to give this information to people by the vote tomorrow . #% President Clinton 's call for the enforcement of trade labour standards for developing countries and elsewhere in the world was the death knell of these talks . #% We want a statement and an action plan . #% We have EU funding of political groups , and I believe that criticism of the EU itself will very soon be deemed xenophobic , and that action might be taken against parties such as mine . #% The fact that 75 of the 500 members of parliament are appointed by the army shows some of the limits on democracy . #% It provides them with the status of legal and political equality and protects their interests as the smaller community . #% I trust Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri to negotiate further on behalf of Parliament before 24 March . #% That may be so , but if we are working towards equal treatment for people with disabilities , people who are visually impaired , surely we have to start to make progress now and we can not have an arbitrary cut-on date as opposed to a cut-off date . #% I do not see this as a hindrance to future negotiations , but as a major incentive for the LTTE to stop the violence . #% As the complexity of Parliament 's comments has demonstrated , further evolution is likely to be desirable and necessary in this case . #% Last month I tabled a question for this session of Question Time to the Council on a related subject , that of EU kerosene tax . #% That is why we urge President Clinton to grant clemency in this case and a moratorium on federal executions . #% Perhaps , as is usually the case , once more men start working flexibly , we will suddenly see much more interest in pensions keeping up with different forms of work . #% Once again , a European Parliament rapporteur intends to use a straightforward technical exercise to advance the wholly undemocratic goal of a European superstate . #% Indeed , as we move into the third generation of mobile technology , one of the major concerns about the providers of electronic communications services and they have said that to us in our capacity as Members of Parliament working in this field is that they want us to help get the framework for content delivery right and to make sure that we get the creative works out into the marketplace because they want those creative works there to stimulate their electronic communication services . #% 
I am very proud to be the rapporteur in an extremely innovative area , which has taken on great importance following the appalling events of 11 September . #% No wonder 21 countries are too wise to get caught in an EU rail web leading to mayhem on all stations to Brussels . #% That in my view would be immoral to low-income countries and it would be insane economics for the working people of Europe . #% I particularly want to see measures on movements of wild birds , and we must prepare in case there is a mutation of the virus into a human pandemic . #% We are , however , divided about the clearest way of achieving this result . #% The same applies to diesel fuel : it is three times more expensive in the UK . #% Mr President , I fully support the idea behind this directive but there are certain tests to which we should submit the proposal and our amendments . #% Life expectancy is 46 years - the lowest in the world apart from Somalia . #% I thank the two rapporteurs for taking on board the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and look forward to a worthwhile result . #% These mainly Druze and Maronite Christians are blaming the one-party Syrian dictatorship for their country 's problems . #% If that is the case , would you not further agree that the debate about the safety of British beef ought to be concluded by 10 November next and on Wednesday , if the Commission has no word on that matter , will you bring forward , regrettable as they are , the legal proceedings which are then overdue ? #% However , to get a good majority , I believe , is possible . #% No European has the right to detain and remove a British subject from the UK without due process , and that means protection from imprisonment after three days unless a court hears the evidence and decides otherwise . #% In relation to TENs - the trans-European networks - the statement proposed in the Commission text , that action has to be taken to remove the last obstacles to the achievements of the TENs projects is deleted in the Council text . #% Indeed , the cases of people playing by the rules and investing either in their companies - with the Enron example before us or indeed in Equitable Life in my own country - and making private pension provision , show that you can not trust the markets any more than you can sometimes trust governments . #% in writing . - The ECR Group are the strongest supporters of equality between men and women and especially the principle of equal pay and equal opportunity in the workplace . #% Will the Council take this into account when trying to broker a deal ? #% There are of course many details that still need to be dealt with here . #% So amendments , such as Nos 1 , 5 and 10 which stress the existence of this right , are very important . #% The prospect of British taxpayers funding foreign workers is , frankly , unacceptable . #% The message to the many people who are facing uncertainty in Rüsselsheim , Bochum and Trollhättan -- and I have been to some of those plants -- is that there is life after restructuring . #% Now for the third suggestion . #% Members of this House in particular should have a proper sense of perspective as to what is happening today . #% We have to acknowledge very clearly what the perception of developing countries is . #% You have asked specifically today for thoughts to take forward , so perhaps I can give you a couple of things to think about . #% The so-called war veterans - they must have been very young when the war of independence was on - have been paid to be on these farms . #% We point to the agreement between the European Community Shipowners ' Association and the Federation of Transport Workers in the EU as an example of best practice in this regard . #% The Commission 's Green Paper and Parliament 's response make those arguments . #% On 22 November , three days earlier , the Commission had imposed a temporary ban , and we have to ask the Commission why . #% Consultation on those proposals is a legal requirement and the views of Parliament and Member States , as well as those of the staff , will naturally be taken into account on all relevant matters , including the possible use of external expertise on the interinstitutional disciplinary board . #% I want to thank in particular the Commissioner and , if I may , my dear former colleague , Cecilia Malmström , for that commitment . #% This is a matter that has outraged the United Kingdom and many others . #% Once the people of Zimbabwe have their freedom restored , and genuine democracy and the rule of law established , I feel sure that the international community , including the EU , stands ready to come forward with generous assistance . #% Let me just say that , in the Committee on Petitions , we can only react to and deal with petitions that we have received and we have received no petitions from any other Member State regarding the confiscation of vehicles . #% It would be quite wrong , therefore , to deny our people the chance of greater prosperity , because we are diverted and distracted , possibly for a long period of time , by a structural issue which seems to be going nowhere at present . #% As National Treasurer of the Anti-Nazi League in Britain and a member of the steering committee of Unite Against Fascism , I had the privilege of speaking at the recent ` Love Music , Hate Racism ' event in Trafalgar Square to urge opposition to England 's home-grown fascist party , the BNP , in the local elections . #% In your letter last October to the Chair of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , you accused Parliamentarians of making false claims about what you called the alleged intransparency of the EU decision-making process . #% These countries need to improve their democratic and human rights record . #% We do not support the proposal that the UK should dismantle fissile material production facilities . #% I am aware that there is a proposal for a further such round table jointly between the European Union and US interests . #% They are important and highly relevant to this discussion . #% We call upon the Haitian Government , the opposition and civil society to engage in a constructive dialogue , possibly in the framework of a national conference to pave the way for free and fair legislative elections . #% There will be continuity of understanding and consultation with the people with disabilities themselves . #% Having consulted with the farming industry , feed manufacturers and the insurance sector , we find that the consequences of introducing financial guarantees have not been sufficiently analysed . #% Apart from malaria , water-borne diseases that debilitate and destroy include typhoid , dysentery , cholera , hepatitis , trachoma , fluorosis and Japanese encephalitis . #% To reply to what you said to me , the regulations are already in place . #% Regarding the costs , I would like a letter from Mr Priestley outlining the costs . #% If that is the case , we are looking at very small quantities indeed , and there are a number of members of the committee who feel that essentially this proposal that we are looking at tonight is unenforceable and represents another occasion where the European Commission has produced something which looks good but which will not actually work out in practice . #% Let us do that and recognise that the people , when asked directly , say ` no ' to the Constitution , not least because they view with dismay the allocation of more and more of their money to pre-accession and even pre-candidate countries , some of which are undeveloped . #% That is why my Group will support the amendment that was supported by the Legal Affairs Committee to secure a pilot programme of access to specialised legal advice . #% Despite the substantial under spending in the budget that is largely due to the Life III lines , and bearing in mind that the Court of Auditors have not voiced concerns , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy recommends that discharge be granted in respect of the 2000 budget for the budget lines within its competence . #% The institutions which are at present contemplating an above-average rate of growth in Heading 5 expenditure will doubtless want to give further attention to this matter . #% author . - Mr President , I am sorry to take up Members ' time . #% I very much hope that following the work we have done on the new European Health and Safety strategy here in Parliament - a report will shortly be appearing in my own name - on a proposal from the Commission for a multi-annual programme for high levels of health and safety in SMEs . #% The most recent key date for Mr Guellec is 29 October 2004 , when the Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome . #% The Turkish security forces had to retake the prisons by force facing organised armed opposition and the circumstances of many deaths is not clear while of course every death is a tragedy . #% Furthermore , it is my belief that many of these individuals are so dangerous that they would not have hesitated to attack their own guards . #% I firmly believe that if there was an independent British voice -- and I am talking here about the world 's third largest trading nation -- at the WTO next month , it could actually speak up for the Third World . #% First , good development practice means that aid is successful when the beneficiaries themselves participate in the programmes that deliver that aid - helping people to help themselves . #% At the time , one state - regrettably and shamefully my own , the United Kingdom - refused to change the system . #% It augurs very well for the future of what we should hope to achieve through this process , because Parliament has been very responsible in its approach to using codecision . #% There is no room for tyrants in Latin America any more . #% The message to the UK Government was clear : to help prevent the slaughter of millions of healthy animals and to save farmers and the tourist industry from economic ruin , the government must urgently start a vaccinate-now firebreak campaign . #% I am personally pleased that an amendment has been tabled to that effect and I am sorry that it is not in the resolution . #% Madam President , in the past weeks we have seen the cycle of contrasts and contradictions that has come to characterise the EU 's relationship with the Middle East . #% It is very important in terms of the interinstitutional agreement with Parliament to know exactly what the Council 's approach is to impact assessments . #% 
This is how mankind now manages the natural order . #% A week later , she was beaten to death by neighbours who said that she had brought shame to their community . #% I am not surprised : this is the EU at work . #% We have , it is being said , sold out to the detergent manufacturers . #% I would like to call upon the inspiration of the late , great Elvis Presley at this moment - it is now or never , tomorrow is too late . #% Nevertheless I will take this opportunity to put on record my party 's opposition to this measure . #% We are not scrapping them ; we are proposing to deal with them under other procedures - either existing or new procedures . #% It is the Commission which is charged with assessing and acting on such issues as are laid out in the Treaties , and as requested by this Parliament only a few months ago . #% Nevertheless , I accept that there are some areas in which the Union can act together to express its will , and one such area is Taiwan . #% But the petition that was handed in to Downing Street this week , bearing a million signatures , referred to the need for proper food labelling , which can counteract the misleading claims that are often made . #% The report we have put before you tonight , colleagues , contains 55 proposed amendments to the regulation package . #% There are , however , at least four areas that are in need of clarification : first , in paragraph 2 , we talk about the need for pre-competitive research . #% Finally , the case of the 14 British and Dutch plane-spotters detained for nearly five weeks in Greece without trial is extremely disturbing . #% This should be regarded as being a frivolous attempt to wreck this report and it would serve no purpose to refer it back . #% in writing . - Some might be surprised that we should support a motion by the GUE/NGL Group . #% I am getting ahead of myself . #% What do we want , where do we want to go and what do we want to say to our citizens so that we can live in peace within our frontiers and contribute to global peace outside them ? #% It is as if it is running scared from confronting the implications of its role as the guardian of the Treaties . #% Finally , there have been far too many cases of meat containing specified risk material being exported into the United Kingdom . #% After tomorrow 's vote we should all pause for some thought about how we can make this directive fully environmentally friendly , cost-effective and attractive to the public . #% I hope that will change at the summit . #% Mr President , you did not draw attention to the fact that this month we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the accession of the United Kingdom , Denmark and Ireland to the European Union . #% I do not think that assessing capital according to risk under management actually reflects the risk undertaken . #% We have already seen security established largely in southern Iraq . #% Yet guilty men and women are still at large . #% It leaves a lot of hostages to fortune . #% What was striking was that , for every employee who felt under pressure to opt out , we found others who wanted the right to choose what hours they worked and what salary , status and job satisfaction they gained as a result ( ... ) . #% There is certainly confusion about definitions within the directives and there is a need for clarification of the texts to make them more coherent . #% The EU already possesses its own anthem , flag , citizenship , army , currency etc. and a whole host of quasi-federal institutions . #% To date , the Commission knows that at least 23 CDP members have been jailed for subversion as a result of their efforts to exercise those rights to which China is committed . #% Speakers today , from Graham Watson onwards , have made those points earlier . #% Ways will have to be found to bring Turkish Cypriots out of their political and economic isolation . #% Yet no institution , neither the Commission nor the European Central Bank , nor any Member of this House , warned those governments against such easing . #% We owe it to British jobs , the future of investment in our ports and above all safety to reject this proposal . #% A number of thoughts and pointers are in this report . #% I never bought a dud bank for my clients , but over the past few years , I have had the politicians and bureaucrats put a gun to my head , as a taxpayer , and make me buy more dud banks than you could shake a stick at . #% It is up to the Commission to ensure that effective financial management structures to guarantee the integrity of the funding system are in place and , if necessary , to withhold funding until that is the case . #% As the rains in Sierra Leone have come to an end , the campaign of violence and terror against the civilian population has resumed . #% Those three areas are agriculture , fisheries and CFSP . #% Under the current Treaty , there are only two ways . #% The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has heard no convincing evidence that GM foods are a threat to human health or to biological diversity . #% They just want a reasonable payment , made more quickly and on a regional basis . #% We must stop manufacturers and retailers claiming their products are not tested on animals when one or more of the ingredients have been so tested . #% Vigorous and purposeful implementation of the Delors White Paper would have provided the kind of growth and impetus which would have matched the drive towards debt prudence . #% I know that in the short term it may be difficult to prove that but I am quite sure that in the long term this is a vital part of making our economies competitive in the wider world . #% All political prisoners must be released or tried under due process of law . #% The truth is that prohibition lies at the very heart of many of our problems . #% But as far as our own Parliamentary report is concerned , I would like to make sure that we stick with the text agreed in committee , which talks very clearly about vaccination as a tool of first resort . #% There has also been funding for the maintenance and development of communication and information systems and schemes . #% Mr President , this is , I suppose , the parliament in Europe that takes human rights the most seriously , and we have great possibilities in dealing with countries that violate human rights . #% I recognise that he is doing what he can to promote the agenda . #% I think we should be considering how our open market closed-border policies are assisting the market forces driving the increases in human trafficking . #% Creating two separate regulations will undermine the objective to streamline and clarify development policy programmes and , as the world 's poorest region , transferring funds from Asia to Latin America can not be justified . #% It is important to know how seriously governments are now taking the way crime undermines the basis of a democratic society . #% What we want to hear perhaps from the Commissioner today is a clear timetable from her as to the speed at which she will be acting in the months to come . #% Finally , on the Council point that Mr Harbour very fairly raises , I have to say to him that my view is slightly different from his . #% So we need to be certain that the food we eat has been grown in soil we can trust and the fertilisers added to it are known to be safe . #% We have to have a study into the situation disabled people face in institutions in particular . #% We have alternatives to such surveillance and should have adopted them . #% We must talk tough and act tough with the KLA as much as with the security forces . #% That report dealt with a very wide spectrum of relationships : the economic , the political and , of course , the question of human rights . #% While talking about the Commission , Mr President , you mentioned the Convention . #% On behalf of taxpayers , we demand real added value for money spent at EU level . #% If there is anything that could demonstrate the proof of this and its relevance to our society , and indeed to the world as a whole , we must look to Seoul in Korea to see just how trade union rights are being taken away from workers with the horrendous violence which is being seen on the streets there . #% You might expect a bit of an old hand in development like me -- as you are yourself -- to be somewhat sceptical about the possibilities that we can deal with , in particular the coherence issues related to development , foreign policy and other policy areas such as agriculture and trade in the European Union . #% I hope this will be recognised by the Council as a clear signal that they should end the uncertainty about its location , which is making it so difficult for this embryonic institution to recruit staff and develop as an effective agency . #% 
I agree fully that , for the sake of parliamentary scrutiny and financial control , the service ought to be attached to the Commission , for administrative and budgetary purposes . #% If you look at page 15 of the English version of the Minutes it is quite clear that 30 fewer people voted on paragraph 5 and 28 fewer voted on Amendment No 4 , against the general pattern of the debate . #% I hope that we are going to carry those forward seriously , because we need to examine this ideal of becoming the world 's most internationally competitive continent in the light of asking ourselves what the implications are for the global losers if we are the global winners , and what this is going to do to enhance stability , equality and justice in the world . #% In relation to the Commission at least , which has a number of registers , I would also welcome the establishment of a single register , even if it is only a single doorway into the other registers . #% The situation has clearly deteriorated , and the Council should take action immediately to implement the measures that it agreed in its common position . #% However , we are pleased to vote with anybody , if we agree with what they propose . #% Madam President , as others have said , I welcome Mr Schwaiger ' s excellent work on what was a very complex set of issues to deal with . #% I thank the Commissioner for his response . #% This resolution calls for clemency for a number of cases cited by Amnesty International and there can be no doubt that the plight of the stateless Kurds in Hassake and the discrimination against the still remaining small Jewish community are totally unacceptable . #% These are questions which all our group supports . #% My country was hoodwinked into joining the European Union in 1973 on the basis of it being just a free trade area . #% Belarus was more damaged by the Chernobyl accident than any other country . #% However , the European social model is a mishmash that pleases no one : a bit of free market here and a bit of welfare state there , mixed with a little green posturing . #% I make no apology for mentioning this repeatedly , and I have called for it in my report yet again . #% Indeed , in the UK we are moving to a car-tax structure based on emissions levels . #% It was a pity nothing was said at Tampere about rights to access information and documents despite transparency being cited as one of the important principles . #% I hope the Commissioner tonight will not simply support the principle of training in this respect , but will also commit himself to beginning to deliver it in practice . #% It is therefore a sub-sector that needs support and sensible regulation . #% If we get rid of the opt-out , there will be many cases of workers not being able to do overtime and therefore not getting a reasonable pay level . #% Indeed , the poorest areas of the world like Africa have themselves been victims of foreign terrorism , as we saw in the embassy bombings in Kenya . #% on behalf of the ITS Group . - Madam President , I believe the Council of Ministers should consider as a matter of urgency appointing a team of genuinely independent , internationally respected accountants to carry out a full-scale investigation and analysis of the audit of this institution , its treasury , its accounting systems and controls and all its operational institutions as well , many of which trade commercially and yet routinely escape the full vigour of the law in their financial and business management . #% We accept them as being those which the industry can attain and can afford . #% Nuclear power is a vital source of energy across Europe , with some Member States getting as much as 75 % of their electricity from nuclear power , and a review of the safety of nuclear power plants should be a priority , including stress tests on existing plants . #% Commissioner , do you remember standing here just a few months ago , after the Palestinian delegation had returned from meeting Mr Haniyeh in Gaza , before the breakdown of the Palestinian Unity Government , saying to this House that you wanted to do everything you could to support that Government ? #% The Commission will present detailed proposals in a document scheduled for October of this year . #% In memory of the victims of yesterday I will vote `` no '' to their collaboration with the criminals of tomorrow . #% Immigration and asylum policy should be the sole prerogative of the independent sovereign nation state . #% Parliament should behave responsibly as a grown-up legislator , not as a petulant child . #% Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform . #% That has not happened and we must be quite unequivocal in sending the message to Iraq , and indeed to the people of Kuwait , that we in Europe are not going to forget and are not going to ignore the plight of those people still being improperly imprisoned in Iraq . #% If those independent experts give it a clean bill of health , we should respect that and , just as we often pass condemnatory motions on Slovakia , we should also respect good news when it comes from Slovakia . #% At a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy last week , Britain was accused of being a rogue state headed by a war criminal . #% But if the financial services plan is to work , this directive has to be in place . #% In fact , nine years on , normalisation has not taken place , the embargo has not been lifted , the light water reactors are seven years late and , of course , the US strong-armed first Japan , then the Republic of Korea and then the EU into cutting off the supplies of heavy fuel oil . #% I have been talking about this with American lawyers over recent weeks - personal friends , I have no interest to declare here . #% With Eurostat he has shut the stable door too late , a long time after the horses have bolted , and is looking to blame the messengers rather than resolving the problem . #% Even if representatives of the Council were here , which they do not appear to be , even if they were prepared to make statements , which they do not appear to be , we would not be able to leave them to do it on their own . #% Mr President , you will recall that when we had our great debate with the accession countries in Strasbourg , I finished my contribution by quoting an English saying that there is many a slip ` twixt cup and lip . #% Would he share with me the view that , if the Council took more interest in his reforms , it would help their speedy and thorough implementation to achieve the end that we all want , which is the most professional and effective European civil service . #% It needs to work in conjunction with the three institutions and ensure that the proposals coming from those institutions are compatible with and not in contradiction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our international obligations . #% Mr President , both the Maastricht and the Amsterdam Treaties focus on environment protection measures . #% To compound matters , there was only one translation available , in English . #% It is not so long ago that we addressed this issue and produced a set of rules that were appropriate to the situation , and which Mr Blokland was seen to be happy with at the time and did not complain about . #% For the same reasons we -- and they -- do not wish to see the Constitution enacted because they see it as based on obsolete economic and political theories of the 1950s , of the fear of war and an outdated threat of communism . #% How else can the regime explain Mr Ai 's arrest on economic crimes and because he failed to complete the correct departure procedures for travelling to Taiwan . #% Mr President , in this report we see another example of the so-called beneficial crisis which gives the European Union the opportunity to press forward with yet more political integration . #% Poverty reduction goes hand in hand with the war against disease , disability and death . #% German Deutsche AG diesel engines bypass EU embargoes by going to China and to Burma and the production of military small arms has been shifted to Malaysia , a country that has aggressive export plans for these arms and would not be subject to the EU Code . #% I will sum up by saying that we need to change legislation , but we need to change attitudes - welfare , transport , imports . #% It is clear from recent events , most noticeably in Mostar , that things are not working as well as we would like . #% The British Canoe Union says : ` Significantly , the health risk to canoeists in the water in the UK is very low and on this basis we query the justification to include recreational waters and activities in the directive ' . #% She is Marianne , the symbol of France but taxes in France are now so high that she now has to go and live in London despite the vastly increased taxation under Labour . #% If it turns out that the legal framework for that means of doing business is flawed , it is then going to jeopardise the wellbeing of all Europe ' s citizens . #% I wish the Commission every success in its endeavours to make our roads safer . #% Both the Commission and defence rights organisations like Fair Trials International - I declare an interest , I am a patron - and Justice , on whose council I sit , have pinpointed failings in the arrest warrant . #% I should like to say , on behalf of the ELDR Group , that we are fully and undividedly behind the agreement reached in conciliation and will vote accordingly . #% We will strive to ensure full cooperation between the different participants where there are clear overlaps between civil administration and reconstruction . #% It allows price improvement : without price improvement the compromise is not workable . #% In my opinion , sovereign Member States should be free to set their own criteria and levels of taxation , and not have the EU dictate to them . #% Mr President , this motion celebrates the good news , the successful ending of the Sharm el-Sheikh negotiations and the agreement of safe passage for Palestinian goods , vehicles and people . #% Even their answers to specific questions were evasive . #% It is interesting to reflect that what we achieved in our agreement in May 2001 was somehow historic , amongst 15 Member States moving from different traditions and cultures , and different approaches , to openness and transparency . #% That is the challenge to all our institutions . #% The whole point of the liberalisation process is that it should bring the benefits of efficient , competitive , consumer-sensitive utility supplies to be widely available to consumers , both domestic and business . #% There will surely be debates , for example , on enlargement . #% If they fail to do so they will be consigned to history as foolish cowards . #% 
Yes , we want a solution . #% However , when I said this in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs during the working time directive debate and tried to contribute some best practice from a Member State -- the UK -- I was firmly told by that rapporteur : ` We do n't want you dumping your ideas on us ' . #% What we could do is reduce the amount of speaking time for urgencies so there will be an opportunity for a debate on each of them . #% We must keep the pressure on Saddam Hussein . #% They came to a hearing on late payments that was being organised in the Parliament and gave some very good expert advice , recognising that we had problems with late payment in the single market . #% While man does not live by bread alone , the year-on-year growth rates of 10 % - plus have transformed China from the country I first knew more than 20 years ago . #% I feel the clause about unmarried partners which says that Member States may admit an unmarried partner if the legislation of the Member State treats unmarried couples in the same way as married couples is slightly perverse . #% This Parliament has recognised on many occasions that victims of rape , child victims of sex abuse , are particularly vulnerable . #% Finally it might just see the light . #% Let us take the Commission targets , which are not bad targets at all - the Commission proposal is not a bad proposal at all - let us examine them carefully and let us refine them . #% In this instance labelling can enable the public to be alerted without inducing panic , and facilitate the tracing back of contaminated beef to the shop , slaughterhouse or farm where the problem started . #% Much more effort is therefore needed from the responsible authorities to promote sustained recovery over the medium-term . #% However , the rest of this report comes under Rule 186 of the Rules of Procedure which specifies that by a simple majority we are allowed to decide to add an item to the Annexes of the Rules . #% In fact , she was the treasurer of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during a period of time when CND took very large donations and refused to reveal the source . #% The enlarged Europe must not be an excuse for us to replace the Iron Curtain with a division between rich and poor people and rich and poor countries . #% If Parliament or Council objects to an implementing measure that the Commission has put forward , the Commission can either withdraw it - I think it has that right implicitly under the Treaty anyway but let us make that explicit - or it can amend it to take account of our objections , or it can put forward a legislative proposal . #% Given today 's dangerous world and the unpredictability of threats in the future , it would be foolish to take any decisions that would weaken our ability to maintain an independent British nuclear deterrent or the credibility of our deterrent policy . #% However , I agree with Mr Poettering that it is important for us to accentuate the Union 's capacity to absorb that country . #% Mr President , as we all know , the last few weeks have been very difficult and we will continue to live in challenging times for many months and years ahead . #% These errors remain in paragraphs 15 , 22 , 25 , 26 , 30 , 31 , 32 and 33 . #% If 3 % growth depends on depleting fish stocks , increasing car travel or cleaning up after crime , it is not the sort of growth that improves the quality of life or quality of the environment for anyone . #% Listen to and see the agony of a doctor who has to tell a non-smoker that she has cancer because she breathed the smoke of someone who thought that smoking looked cool on a screen or on a page . #% Crucially , will they involve the aviation industry and , particularly , airlines before they issue their advice ? #% Words should be followed by action . #% Therefore , I think that on these three items , the 2003 budget has been a success . #% I would also like to express my concern at the rather hypocritical presence , or likely presence , of President Mugabe in Rome this week at the United Nations World Food Summit . #% It is clear that many Member States still have much to do to reduce high levels of unemployment . #% My criticism is aimed at the Commission . #% That is quite a staggering amount across the European Union every year . #% This directive is as important in the fight against terrorism as the bombs which are being dropped on Afghanistan or the efforts of those who are risking their lives there . #% A centralised policy would compound , not ameliorate , the problem . #% I was privileged to be there in the great chamber in Geneva when he made a very eloquent speech on behalf of the European Union . #% Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission , and perhaps of the Union itself . #% The first is to ensure that the person of the party liable in respect of an aircraft is identical to the person required to take out the insurance . #% So I would like to know whether we are now on course to provide 10 million more people with access to drinking water by 2010 as planned and , when it comes to the second call for proposals , whether the process will take less time to complete . #% Clever brokerage will still be able to achieve a respectable deal upon the outcome of the work of Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention . #% I would like to remind the President of the Commission of his pledges to provide transparency and openness in terms of information to this House . #% I support those broad objectives . #% It bodes well for a highly successful UK presidency . #% Yet , it has a population of 130 000 , a bigger population than the Åland Islands which are NUTS II and do get grants from the European Union . #% First , however I should like to say to the Commissioner that the whole conduct of the procedure for the Pact for Stability and Growth has been a very sad series of incidents where attempts were made time and time again to exclude this Parliament from participation in this debate . #% I am still confused about Amendments Nos 20 and 21 , but will speak to Mr Bradbourn about those later . #% I hope that Afghanistan can return to this form of moderate secular government again , and make use of the huge pool of talent residing in more than 50 % of its population . #% It has long been evident that the large sums of money provided to prop up the national level of the Russian economy have not produced the desired effect and that the top-down approach might have appeared simple , but it can be less efficient in the long term . #% So I think this debate should be taken out into the field , to the public , to show a real success story for the EU . #% What concerns me is the revision that has taken place on those growth figures and the likely impact on jobs . #% Can we really afford strategically or financially duplicated staffs and committees , the proliferation of Euro forces and the wastefulness and confusion of subjecting our armed forces to two separate operational doctrines and planning regimes ? #% I would like to support the comments made by Mrs Ahern about the apparent harassment by the genetic engineering lobby of a British charity concerned with medical research . #% An estimated 42 % of black South Africans are jobless as compared with just 4 % of whites . #% We in the Socialist Group strongly support moves to develop tourism , particularly eco-tourism , sustainable tourism , and we welcome what the Commissioner said . #% It is indeed tempting to think of taking retaliatory action through tariffs . #% Mr President , I look to you as a lawyer to give guidance to the House , and also to protect our interests . #% Mr President , early yesterday morning I was present at the unprecedented fire near Hemel Hempstead . #% Turkey can not meet European values or ensure security while it denies the different identity of its Kurdish citizens . #% On the wider package of the Constitutional Treaty as a whole , does the President-in-Office of the Council accept that the European Council was right , in the light of the fact that a majority of Member States have actually ratified this Constitutional Treaty ? #% I look forward to hearing his response . #% Some of the proposed amendments will be counterproductive . #% A report launched in the UK just yesterday by a number of environmental NGOs including Friends of the Earth forcefully made the case that one flight to and from the US could cause more pollution than the average UK motorist causes in a year . #% There are three aspects to today 's debate . #% Mr Barroso , remember : we have discussed this before here . #% The European Parliament , and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy in particular , are very concerned that we should keep the Kyoto momentum going . #% On the EDF , briefly , we are concerned and we had a debate at the part-session in Brussels a few weeks ago . #% In conclusion , the key to that will be transparency of their activities so that all their customers can see exactly what package of services they are getting . #% Mr President , my group welcomed the report by Mr Papayannakis and salutes him for his persistence . #% Some people will say that this methodology is not yet ready to be implemented . #% Perhaps we should apply that same process to the existing 15 Member States , so that instead of promising to do things , people actually do them . #% 
Opening up trade and access creates challenges . #% I urge it to avoid the usual fudge at the meeting later this month and give some real leadership . #% However , I strongly object to what has become a regular and very dangerous sleight of hand in EU policy documents - the displacement of our national governments by the EU , in this instance in its efforts to become the single ` partner ' of the US in the transatlantic relationship . #% That suggestion was approved , but no delegation was approved for Kashmir . #% What a contrast between them and their colleague . #% We need a political resolution , but Russia must be held to account . #% We must ask ourselves , how we can save lives ? #% It is this majority moderate core that the Government must embrace if it is to develop a broad-based political consensus . #% Moldova is very close to being defined as a failed state . #% What we have in February is a hearing . #% Many companies are hamstrung by administrative and legal costs prohibiting the promotion of such funds across the European Union . #% I am sure that Parliament would not be writing today 's Minutes before we have actually had our debates and votes . #% The ground staff at Heathrow were very apologetic but somebody clearly did not realise the importance of ensuring that a plane was available to bring all the Members and other people to Strasbourg . #% Provided that it is kept to the minimum practical level , I have no problem if some of that material is burnt . #% We want to make sure that more people in Europe are interested in the issue of compliance - more people throughout the Member States , not simply in a selection of the northern ones . #% Mr President , I wish , on behalf of my group , to make a number of short points on institutional questions that have arisen from the historic Copenhagen Summit . #% I wish Commissioner Reding well in getting on with this problem . #% Does he agree that if governments have money to spare they should not use it as a tax break for the alcohol and tobacco industries , especially a ludicrous tax break which is only available to frequent international travellers , such as myself , who benefit disproportionately ? #% I believe - as do many of my colleagues - that the king , whom I had the pleasure of meeting on 21 September and whom Mr Solana met only last weekend , does have a role in the future of Afghanistan . #% I should also like to thank the secretariat of the committee not least for the statistical break-down which is provided there which , I must confess , is not my own work . #% I should like to invite you , Commissioner Wallström , to come to my local pub one Sunday lunchtime and meet some real people . #% People do move about , their animals move about and we know from other considerations , which are now taking part in another debate on vaccination which is going on with the import and export of foodstuffs , how many things come into and out of the European Community , which are putting us at hazard . #% They estimated that 32 000 breast cancer deaths across Europe could be prevented . #% However , one direct consequence of all this is that the report is too long : a tribute perhaps to our collective enthusiasm . #% What point is there in asking them to put those systems in place if , a year or two later , we change the whole system again ? #% Although the bulk of the PPE Group is for discharge , there are , however , some concerns that we would like to lay on the table for the future . #% The extent to which the Commission took action in this regard is questionable , particularly as Mrs Schreyer herself issued a so-called reservation , something that this Parliament does not recognise . #% The increase in the numbers of Members of this place requires a complete re-ratification of the Lisbon Treaty . #% We are proposing more flexibility where institutions want to use it in the grading structure , particularly to retain staff with linguistic duties and specific positions where institutions feel that contract staff may not be appropriate . #% Let us see if serious thought should be left to those with experience of the real world , sadly unrepresented in this place . #% I regret that transport issues do not appear to have been taken seriously into account in the enlargement chapter and would encourage the Commission to present proposals to ensure better coordination between structural actions and instruments and the PHARE and TACIS programmes . #% The biggest challenge now facing conservationists is to reduce the demand for bushmeat . #% Even though Mr Prodi has made a statement , if we go by past practices I do not expect a conclusion on this for at least a year . #% We need a more balanced view than this oral question suggests . #% Could I gently remind Mr Haarder that Russia is not a Member State of the European Union , nor is it a candidate country . #% The Committee on Budgetary Control 's earlier report did not whitewash DG XXIII , but it really let them off the hook . #% I very much hope that the House will support those revisions . #% In due course these people must go home . #% Some 15 million of our fellow Europeans will be afflicted by that illness during their lifetime at a cost of some EUR 20 billion per year , plus the cost to the individual and families of lost income and the cost to Member States of lost tax revenues . #% However , there are also important changes which relate to the procedure , which has been streamlined and simplified . #% But what we must remember is that , whatever the current political situation in Cambodia , this is the first election to be called by Cambodia : it is not an internationally enforced initiative but one that came from Cambodia itself . #% If , as we say , we care about the poor and oppressed , if we believe in the right to life , then this House should support me in attempting to shine a light on this disgraceful situation . #% They agree to far too much ; they do far too little ; and this waste water directive illustrates the problem . #% I hope this does not turn out to be a cynical move by VW , taking away with one hand and giving back with another , but in the meantime dramatically driving down wages and terms and conditions . #% But we need to know that the proposed solution is not the cause of even greater problems . #% Mr Camdessus , Head of the IMF , is on record as saying that the UN is just one of the four pillars of the world system . #% However , we also know that we will , in due course , have to address what to do about this text . #% I am sure that the problems presented in one or two lakes in Germany and Austria could be solved , but imposing these limits throughout the whole of Europe where they are often unnecessary will not do that . #% Unless the Commission assiduously ensures the application and enforcement of social laws , social Europe will fall into total disrepute , and citizens will quite rightly turn their backs on the EU . #% From votes for prisoners to refusing to deport terrorist hate preachers , all in the name of ` human rights ' , the EU has damaged Britain , and now wishes to spread this throughout the world , using our taxpayers ' money . #% Will she , in her answer , perhaps add just one or two sentences , particularly in praise of the football authorities of Member States who sought to coordinate the many complaints of genuine football supporters who were caused a great deal of inconvenience during that particular match and managed to communicate those complaints with great clarity to the Italian football authorities ? #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I believe the minimum income report that we have voted through in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is the best way forward and will achieve the widest support . #% It seems that the Commission has not responded . #% Madam President , last year with the European Parliament ' s Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , I had the opportunity to visit Cracow in Poland . #% I would very much like to see the ECB follow a policy of openness and transparency similar to the Bank of England . #% I strongly believe there should be common rules for penalties with those guilty facing a minimum prison sentence of six years rising to ten years for more severe cases . #% On trade , the Commissioner says that if Johannesburg focuses on trade issues we will lose the focus on sustainable development . #% I hope that will mean I get an even more detailed answer . #% Urgent action to catch terrorists and criminals can not be postponed , but the habeas corpus amendment drafted so deftly by Mr MacCormick is very worthwhile . #% It is a fiction to say that , since we all have excellent justice systems , mutual recognition is enough . #% We are looking at the way in which resources have been used for previous years , i.e. the take-up or utilization of each agency 's budget . #% This was also untrue . #% In the light of the Bosman ruling , which I entirely support , the smaller clubs in the United Kingdom are struggling because of the loss of transfer fees . #% I think we must also learn the lessons of the multilateral agreement on investments . #% Marco Polo will make a difference there . #% We remain deeply sceptical that joint Euro-border guards would work in practice and oppose the principle of the European security and defence policy both as a duplication and as a means of de-coupling Europe from our US partners in NATO . #% 
One matter which has not been mentioned in the debate is that there is to be a major review of all of the telecommunications legislation later this year and part of this work has already been started by the Commission under Mr Bangemann 's commissionership . #% This is very strange in an internal market where we actively encourage our citizens and enterprises to travel and conduct their commerce across borders . #% Madam President , in 1996 I had the great honour of representing the UK Government at the World Congress , which was held in Stockholm , Sweden , under United Nations auspices , on the subject of the sexual exploitation of children . #% I congratulate the Presidency and the contact group on the speedy response they have made to the latest crisis . #% I recognise that there are concerns over the natural disasters that have befallen Japan , but I have spoken to many Japanese colleagues , friends and others who believe that , if we tread sensitively , an EU-Japan agreement would send a signal that Japan is back on its way and is on the road to recovery . #% We might also support measures that really had the effect of `` increasing economic efficiency as well as competitiveness '' in the European defence market . #% It merely establishes a different planning and decision-making regime that specifically excludes the Americans . #% Mr President , I should like to ask The British Conservatives , especially Mr Cassidy , during this voting time , to refrain from making obscene gestures to people in the public gallery . #% The European Union institutions are inevitably a large and complex bureaucracy and , of course , there are going to be mistakes and administrative errors . #% I also hope that , once the candidates have overcome their first flush of unquestioning enthusiasm for the European Union , they will begin to adopt a more sceptical attitude to many aspects of the European Union project . #% I fear that the critical poverty targets clearly identified by the Secretary of State could be undermined by the weaknesses of the current trade proposal . #% Mr President , I would like to endorse what Mr Vecchi has said . #% What we do know is that the violence is barbaric and unacceptable and should be condemned absolutely and without any conditions attached to that condemnation . #% Several key aspects are important to be acted on . #% In other words , the euro could stay within its historic trading range and happily now either fall by a further 23 % or rise by 188 % . #% This can be done , but obviously it will take time . #% The Gender Institute should in fact be part of the new EU Agency on Fundamental Rights , just as the Anti-Racism Monitoring Centre will be . #% Do you not agree that the Commission should be looking to promote social dialogue and collective bargaining rather than undermining it ? #% Small business organisations across the EU have contacted me , pleading that the opt-out be kept . #% Now hit by the most deadly storm of the century , innumerable villages , shanty towns , bridges and roads have been swept away , crops destroyed , farm stock decimated , supplies of water eliminated , and many thousands are dead . #% Can I please ask the Conference of Presidents to act on these reports ? #% Mrs Scallon closed by remarking that it was sad that even in the fishing villages of her own country , seafaring , rowing and sailing were not subjects which played a great part in the curriculum . #% We need to change it , but what we see in China is the acceleration of that model . #% I wholly agree with others , that we shall have a discreet budget line for the Baltic Sea strategy to match and balance the very successful work that we do through the Euromed policy , which -- obviously -- historically predates the work in the Baltic . #% And what about your record ? #% I know the Commissioner has been looking for solutions to cancer , because he has discussed that with our committee in the past . #% However , there is reason to believe that the harsh working hours contribute to a significant drop-out rate , with a particular impact on women junior doctors . #% Moreover , Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe , which , of course , binds its government to common standards of democracy , human rights and the rule of law . #% For that reason , I will advise my group to vote for this directive , because it is greatly needed . #% Whilst accepting that you can not take that vote again , if Members notify the services that they wish to change their vote and that takes us over the threshold at 313 , can you inform the House whether it will now be declared as carried in that situation ? #% Even before the recent crisis , the economies of Europe were losing ground to our major rivals and competitors . #% . -- Mr President , that is also acceptable . #% Given the higher growth rate than was predicted in the financial perspectives , which are based on 2.5 % growth , we can see our way forward to taking slightly different measures on budgets than we would otherwise have done . #% My reservation is that the Commission , whilst encouraging growing for the market rather than for subsidies , does not propose the final logical step , namely the complete phasing-out of tobacco subsidies . #% But as a friend of Israel , I am also entitled in this Parliament to speak up for it . #% The inclusion of China in EU space policy , and Galileo in particular , is not acceptable until China becomes a fully democratic state and recognises basic human rights . #% Another point is the late payment argument . #% We would be unable to produce anywhere near enough food for the world if we were entirely on an organic system . #% In terms of funding , I find myself agreeing with Mr Pronk as to the source of funding and again this is going to have to take particular account of the enlargement process . #% I urge Member States to follow the Commission advice and also to note the Glase report . #% To help Mr Galeote and one or two other Members in the state-of-the-art plenary that we have here , I wondered if it would be possible at some future date for Members actually to be able to keep the same seat . #% However , after our experience with the common fisheries policy in the south-west of England we dread it extending its tentacles even further . #% Third , in your speech you referred to people in Sub-Saharan Africa : 30 million with HIV/AIDS , and 291 million living below the poverty line . #% I am glad to say that the results of conciliation do not reflect that refusal and lawyers will have to contact the authorities when they have reason to believe their clients may be seeking advice in order to engage in money laundering . #% Secondly , echoing the comments made by Mr Helmer , we should congratulate the Polish and Spanish Governments on ensuring that this wretched Constitution may be delayed . #% In the Fifth Framework Programme we are already putting EUR 2 billion into the biotechnology industry and I hope that in the Sixth Framework Programme that will increase . #% In a personal letter he has written to me he mentions the fact that this has been a slow process of European legislation not being operated at the right speed . #% Fishing is a terribly difficult subject . #% Because of that some people will wish to take away my right to talk about my sexuality , to celebrate my 22-year relationship and to be part of a wider community . #% Mr President , I welcome the statement that future spring summits are going to be sustainability summits , and thank the Swedish Presidency for their real leadership on this . #% The problem is that these women are both victims and illegal immigrants , but most governments treat them principally as illegal immigrants only . #% In Africa they have under five doctors per 100 000 people . #% You say in your White Paper that there is a real need to raise management skills and create a common management culture across the Commission . #% If they are giving answers , can I suggest that they e-mail their answers to the MEPs as well , so we can use the information , not just to the press , who often just spike it . #% Lastly , I welcome the call for more dialogue and increased issue linkage between the ILO and other international organisations , such as the WTO and the World Bank . #% That is why in this resolution we are calling for a Commission taskforce to be established with the common purpose to develop far more integrated strategies and to coordinate the use of Community resources to combat social exclusion in the European Union . #% That is an area where we can - and because of Marco Polo will - see more growth . #% Indeed , their budgetary arrangements for the first two years after accession are also secure . #% That proposed solution was subsequently examined by the budgetary trialogue and will now be formally presented for approval at the Conciliation Committee meeting of 24 November 2003 . #% The effect on local indigenous fishermen continues to be highlighted , and yet the attitude that the EU can simply come in and take the livelihoods of such subsistence fishermen is worrying . #% I believe that Parliament has allowed itself to be browbeaten by the big pharmaceutical companies and by the Commission , and that we have taken a massive step backwards . #% This is a test of the Commission 's real commitment to simplification . #% The rapporteur confirmed the importance of SMEs as the motor of employment , but SMEs have only a tiny voice within UNICE and most of their employees do not have membership of trade unions . #% In the end , we have a good result . #% It was implicated in the start of the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the north-east of England and also in the inquiry into the Classical Swine Fever outbreak in East Anglia , which suggested that the cause might have been a discarded ham sandwich thrown into a field of outdoor pigs . #% Thirdly , it needs to be recognised when it is not reasonable to execute a European Arrest Warrant , so that someone is not followed by alerts in the Schengen Information System around Europe even though their surrender has been refused once on valid grounds . #% 
Secondly , our ability to deliver jobs for our citizens and economic security for their families is central to our continuing success . #% His reply then was , ' Look , we have this vast population , several million people , and you are only able to bring up six cases ' . #% The points I would underline in his report are as follows : in paragraph 4 he makes the very important point about the European civil service . #% I also support that this Parliament sends a delegation of Members of this House , as observers , to the conference so that they can report back to the House on the progress in this very important area . #% I agree entirely with the rapporteur . #% Sadly for him the Constitution is not an essential objective for French and Dutch voters . #% These are serious considerations . #% We must not put pressure on ACP countries to enter into negotiations they do not feel to be appropriate , and we must safeguard and respect the rights of LDCs to non-reciprocal trade preferences . #% Equally , there are other conflicts as a result of both the Soviet system which wasted water and the collapse of the system which has led to chaos in terms of distribution of water supply . #% This terrible event led to the murders of my constituents Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight . #% In order for the EU to show itself to be serious about non-implementation of this legislation , the use of sanctions against irresponsible employers is vital . #% It is our job to make that cliché reality . #% I think it is very important that prison officers are protected as well . #% I should like to deal briefly with both of those issues in turn . #% Infection in cattle and sheep is negligible so we can continue to eat our rare steak . #% Secondly , on buildings , the Bureau has made too many decisions without referring back to the appropriate committee - the Committee on Budgets . #% Can I invite you therefore under Rule 38 ( Statements explaining Commission decisions ) to ask the Commission at the end of today 's agenda to come to this House and explain the decision that was taken yesterday to fine the French football authorities a derisory # 650.00 for a clear breach of Community rules . #% The report focuses specifically on combating child sex tourism but , as we all know , the issue is much broader than this . #% Developing countries themselves take insufficient interest in the importance of education . #% It would help the House greatly if we could have details of the German compromise proposal tonight , before ECOFIN next week . #% We - the Commission , Council and Parliament - have to be a lot more ambitious in actually allocating much more money towards this enormous task . #% Not only should this type of activity be punishable , but it should be classed as a criminal offence . #% And yet Mr McCartin comes to the conclusion that he should recommend discharge . #% I will not repeat these , but suffice to say , this is a major advance for consumers . #% On the other hand , parliamentarians are the elected representatives and I would like to see much more engagement by them in programming , in implementation , in monitoring and in evaluation . #% Clearly there is room for improvement . #% It gives me great pleasure to present this report to the House on behalf of the Industry Committee . #% With so little to spend , it is important that we spend it efficiently and effectively . #% I very much hope that we can get some further information on the successful measures and the extent to which the problem is being reduced . #% This amendment fell by three votes in committee , but , if Parliament were to adopt it , it would really add something to the legislation . #% Mr President , the Accession Partnership sets out a series of important and challenging priorities for Turkey to address as part of its preparations for European Union membership . #% It is not up to us to enforce a particular business model . #% I hope that all my colleagues in the House , wherever they might be tonight , will take a pragmatic and sincere approach to this problem in tomorrow 's vote . #% The same is true of Council questions : at least nine questions which were tabled after my question are ahead of it . #% Those are smart sanctions that will not hurt the poor people of Zimbabwe but would certainly hurt those Zimbabweans who very much like coming to London to shop in Harrods or visit their children who are in British public schools . #% In my experience - since the time when I was EU-China rapporteur back in 1997 , 10 years ago when this process began - there has been absolutely no product in human rights terms from China in the sense that people 's lives have been improved or prisoners have been released or torture has stopped or the massive imprisonment reported by Harry Wu from the Laogai Foundation has ended . #% Finally , on Article 6 , point ( c ) , the fourth and last indent in the English version reads as if it almost contradicts the previous indent . #% We still find irritations here . #% The alternative to this modest step is no step at all . #% I would like assurance that we are not returning women to Afghanistan . #% This is the first occasion on which the European Parliament has given its views on the progress of the European Central Bank and in this context it is my pleasant duty to congratulate the ECB and Mr Duisenberg , as President , on its success so far . #% Turkey also has to accept the EU 's right to negotiate admission with any country it feels fit to negotiate with . #% There is concern amongst non-governmental organizations as well as several Members , and we will be partially reassured by your answer about the study . #% Yes - there needs to be more openness . #% Well , the British Government did not endorse or commend him . #% A ten-year phase-out is the best way of promoting the welfare of laying hens . #% This report is to be welcomed by the industry and the European Parliament and will ensure that we have safe and secure energy supplies in the future . #% It is significant , but not equivalent to what is happening in Tunisia and Egypt . #% But does this Charter add to what we already have ? #% I was delighted that the Bactrian gold treasures were recovered and I would like to see funds devoted to the reconstitution of the National Museum in Kabul as a symbol of national pride under the patronage of the royal family , which is a benign uniting force in the land . #% I want to focus on just two such resources . #% But there are few signs that we are even beginning to make a start in doing that . #% It would be good to introduce this on a permanent basis and not just on this one-off occasion . #% We are proud that Britain as a nuclear power is leading efforts towards a nuclear non-proliferation agreement in May in New York that involves global consensus . #% The events last night in Copenhagen underline the importance of the European Parliament having this debate , as it decided to do earlier in the week . #% I must agree with the Commissioner and the Commission position on the primacy of safety issues . #% We need to take care also over this question of international monitors . #% They must recognise that this is a global issue and one that can not be dealt with on an individual basis in each country . #% The fact is that , despite the state of the market , the coffee companies are doing very well , thank you . #% Even if I do not agree with all the proposed solutions , in particular I welcome the commitment to a comprehensive review of the single market . #% He and I might disagree on the pace of that expansion but it is very important for documents like this to acknowledge that there is a case for changing our definition as developments in technology and on the market move forward . #% Those people who know me , know me for being a practical person , not somebody up there in the clouds wishing further ideology to descend on businesses , but somebody who sees the real advantages for the person in the workplace . #% You like to portray the EU as a supporter and advocate of developing countries and yet the EU is now perceived as bullying these countries into a new set of issues on investment and competition , in spite of the fact that the vast majority of them have already categorically said that they do not want negotiations in these areas . #% However , I would like to address one specific issue where the Commission and indeed all of us are rather weak : that is the issue of regulatory burdens . #% This also has wider implications . #% I do not think that anyone would doubt that the situation in Pakistan is very serious and very volatile . #% 
Should the ECB see the value of its assets fall by just 4.25 % , its entire capital base will be wiped out . #% I am incorporating a number of our amendments , including my own . #% Mr Chanterie is also to be congratulated . #% The feasibility of financial guarantees or insurance policies has not been properly developed with the industry and it is unclear whether such guarantees would be available from the insurance sector . #% Will he build on the success of yesterday 's unique conference on Iraq , which demonstrated the profound endurance of British policies ? #% The contributions of our ally , Norway , and Iceland , now an aspiring EU Member State , have further galvanised European participation in the Arctic Forum . #% There is no point in the Indonesian Government complaining when the international community , the United States , the EU and Japan , draft a resolution expressing their concern if they in turn are not prepared to allow international monitors in and are not prepared to allow humanitarian organisations into their country to bring assistance to the civilian population . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , today is supposed to represent a new start for Europe , but what have we here ? #% It is going to push for the third money laundering directive . #% Let us hope these next few hours give a real chance for dialogue and trialogue between our three institutions . #% author . - Madam President , I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group and as the Party of European Socialists ' shadow rapporteur on the Economic Partnership Agreement ( EPA ) with the group of southern African countries that included Madagascar . #% . Mr President , I congratulate Mr Barroso for producing this remarkable document . #% There is currently a dangerous and unprecedented American reaction to European integration . #% Citizens must be able to see what is being agreed in their names by national ministers of national governments so that they and opposition parties can hold them to account . #% Do we ensure that national parliaments engage in their scrutiny role ? #% I am told that the government representative is five minutes away . #% I want Member States to be required to meet the target , save where it is physically impossible for them to do so . #% The fact that the ILO Convention now has a time limit set down effectively in the form of the other two directives means that we will , I am sure , have sufficient Member States with sufficiently large fleets ratifying the Convention to make sure that it too comes into effect in mid-2002 . #% So I think that there is a threat there and I hope that the Commission and the European Central Bank , although it is probably too late to consider whether to issue a five hundred euro note , will actually consider whether they should issue it at the beginning of the process when there are so many dangers attached to it . #% This report is without a doubt an important contribution to the debate . #% The dossiers are complex and the inclusion of issues which are Member State competences , such as public expenditure in the area of health , does not help matters . #% In Amendment No 4 we are calling for the adoption of specific measures by the Bureau and ` the evaluation of the report by the Committee on Budgets on the basis of a working document drafted by its rapporteur ' . #% I say to you in generous terms , please get out more , come and spend more time with us and together let us build a real consumer-driven internal market . #% Our unity as a European Union should be deployed in support of their efforts . #% Small businesses are important not just for jobs but also for trade in this European Union . #% I would counsel you , if you want to keep your AAA status , to ignore the pleas of this House - full of eccentrics , greenies and bored housewives - in particular , in relation to paragraph 48 of the report . #% We very much hope that by using the means that are currently being employed we will , without great delay , secure the outcomes which will serve the interests of humanity and be consistent with the views continually expressed by the Union , the Commission and this House . #% The great sadness in all of this is the effect it is having on the citizens of Zimbabwe , whose only crime is to have Mr Mugabe as their president . #% I am pleased to hear that the Commission 's proposals for guidelines on the subject of coexistence are on schedule . #% Therefore , we have abstained on this report . #% Mr Tindemans is right to point out that not all EU Member States are ready to work towards a common defence policy , despite the fact that at Amsterdam the WEU was regarded as an integral part of the development of the EU . #% We also agree that supplementary information should and can be provided for those Member States that need it and for those special regions which have important information to communicate . #% He has taken a subject of real public relevance : the security of the citizen and how best we ensure it . #% I certainly believe in Member State competence and prerogatives when it comes to the general area of criminal law . #% If that is so , how come foreign ministers were unable recently to make any formal response to President Bush 's admission of CIA secret prisons , just as they were unable to do anything about Guantánamo for four years ? #% Unfortunately , I have to say that this report should be rejected because it advocates the further development of an EU strategy regarding relations with China . #% The money available is better but still inadequate , particularly in view of the bizarre wastage of the CAP , where Europe 's cows live on more , with two dollars per day , than do 700 million Chinese . #% So we are concerned with the substantive follow-up as well . #% I do not see how they can with the rising racism in football , whether in Italy , Spain or elsewhere , the electoral successes of the far right in France and Belgium , Italy and Denmark , plus the threatened breakthrough in 4 May local elections in Britain by our own version of Le Pen 's , the British National Party . #% But they did not need to use any bullets to do it . #% These are the civil liberties that we seek to protect with these proper , balanced data retention rules that are in the proposals before Parliament . #% A telling statistic cited in the report is that Guinea is losing over 34 000 tonnes of fish every year to illegal fishing , worth an estimated USD 110 million . #% Financial control will be absolutely secured , both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes , and because we will introduce a completely professional , independent internal audit service . #% The beleaguered inhabitants of Fiji are looking to the European Union , which they see as the beacon of democracy and racial equality , to come to their aid . #% We believe that successful competitive businesses are the central pillar of our economic life ; they provide economic prosperity , essential to create jobs and to generate the resources on which so much else depends . #% I congratulate Mr Cornillet , in this respect , on his report in what is a very difficult area . #% I have covered the main aspects . #% It is , however , to be hoped that the envisaged annual reports to the Council will be used as a basis for discussion and scrutiny in the European Parliament . #% On the same trip , we visited Fair Trade cocoa farmers in central Ghana . #% It consigns Essex to remain the waste-tip for London , it underestimates the potential for recycling by half , it threatens areas of natural beauty close to people 's homes and to schools and sites of historic interest . #% Those amendments do not improve the report ; rather they are a crude attempt to add the biased , distorted and racist sentiment of the signatories concerned . #% However , I would say to Mr Liese and those who think like him that they have no right to impose their particular views on the whole of European society through the means of legislation . #% Colleagues , we often speak of human rights in the abstract , in terms of well-rehearsed subjects and themes , but in this instance I should like to ask colleagues to imagine themselves as an 18-year old on holiday abroad . #% I am sure the Commission has too . #% These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC . #% Sadly , in the United Kingdom , as a result of the failure of the British Government 's health policies , hundreds of thousands of people are waiting unacceptably long times for operations and treatments . #% With the sharply rising number of cross-border marriages - almost one in five couples now come from two Member States - and with the rising percentage of couples and individuals over retirement age travelling around the European Union , does the Commission not feel that , unless it takes urgent action on these matters , unequal treatment will lead to health refugees rather than the more widely speculated health tourists in the EU ? #% We wish to clarify it and to have a document to that effect . #% But is this not really just the bunker mentality ? #% In that time , every six months , I get mounds of documents from the incoming presidency telling me about its priorities - but not this time . #% I welcome the steps that the Commission has finally taken to address the problem but I wonder what makes them so confident that a few years ' breathing space will really make any long-term difference . #% Rightly , the temporary committee had identified this lamentable lack of diligence on the part of the Commission . #% Although the Vice-President/High Representative has made excellent senior appointments - I have seen some of these before the Committee on Foreign Affairs - I must ask why she has been short-changed in a stitch-up by the Commission , which seems to have retained a disproportionate amount of resources for EU enlargement and the European Neighbourhood Policy . #% However , we are eschewing wines from the EU in favour of wines from around the world , in particular Australia and California . #% The last time we voted on this subject some years ago I inserted an amendment asking for joint action between the EC and the Union of the Comoros to protect that ` fish out of time ' , the Coelacanth , which , although thought to have been extinct for tens of millions of years , was rediscovered in deep water off the Comoros in the 1940s . #% For example , it supports terrorists such as the MKO ( Mujahedin-e Khalq Organisation ) , proscribed on the European Union list of terrorists . #% 
The European Council was quite right to resist the temptation to deconstruct the Convention 's work . #% We also want high welfare standards . #% The basis of consumers being able to go to the court of their domicile to receive justice in the event of disputes still remains intact . #% First of all we can only successfully manage fish stocks by having a coincidence of the areas in which they are managed with the management regime itself and the range of those fish stocks . #% I am not proposing to scrap the issue : I am proposing a different procedure for dealing with it , a procedure which will give more weight to the detailed work done in the committee and which should produce even more important results than at the moment . #% Political ties are also strengthening inside and outside ASEAN . #% Mr President , I am sure that you would agree that one of the functions of any politician is to lead by example . #% Mr President , in the aftermath of the Enron scandal , it is tempting simply to say that these proposals for the introduction of international accounting standards into the Community are an idea whose time has come . #% Swine vesicular disease came into the European Union , as did Newcastle Disease . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report . #% When quantities increase as a result of this directive , the value of recycled materials will drop , making the economics of recycling extremely uncertain . #% Only yesterday , the Turkish Army Chief of Staff , General İlker Başbuğ , warned of the dangers posed by Islamist extremists politicising religion , and pledged that the Turkish army would protect the secular nature of the Turkish Republic . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Thors , for her excellent report on an important subject . #% The best means to counter all these factors is to ensure that the immense contribution of immigrants is facilitated , recognised and insisted upon . #% Why do the governments want to preserve spam ? #% Apart from the strong moral argument that we had a responsibility to protect those facing the genocide of the Serbs , we also had the consequences of tens/hundreds of thousands of refugees . #% As Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert mentioned , the area of most serious concern in the Commission 's proposals is the use of financial guarantees . #% The confusion arises from two different versions of the original having been circulated . #% It is not going to be easy , and some of the reasons for that have been outlined . #% They are confined to their cells 23 hours a day . #% I would make a domestic point to my colleagues here , namely that we really address the issue of sustainable development better in this Parliament . #% It is therefore questionable as to why the EU feels the need to impose its will on what is otherwise a sector that flourishes precisely because it is largely free of interference from Brussels . #% None are in the EU and there is no EU team . #% Once more we see the dead hand of EU harmonisation and the EU 's need to control every aspect of its Member States ' lives . #% I do also thank the Council , and especially the Swedish Presidency , for their work in helping us to get agreement on the declaration , which confirms the definite aim of visa liberalisation for all the citizens of the Western Balkans as soon as possible - and we hope that this will be during 2010 , because the absence of a reasonable commonality in the target dates for achieving this free travel is divisive and creates instability . #% The provisions which seek to soften the economic conditions attached to residence in exceptional circumstances need more work and clarification before a further reading . #% There are just two or three points that I would make , briefly , from the consumer point of view of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection . #% Finally , I think it is important for us to support this final agreement so that the rights for all the modes of transport are now in place . #% In view of the diversity of national traditions and the uncertainties of the definition of the concepts , it is essential to continue consultations with the Member States and , at the same time , ensure the laying down of strict rules for the codes of conduct within the Community rules themselves . #% Fourthly , Governor Ryan of Illinois , as we have heard already , has imposed a moratorium on the death sentence in his state because of its appalling record of wrongful convictions . #% Tell that to the people in my region , which has used ECU 30m - # 25m - in the last five years . #% So I congratulate Mrs Klamt for a very valuable report and I hope it will continue to be built on in future . #% I look forward to making further advances on this matter at a later date . #% If the Commission persists in refusing to give a clear answer to this House , we have a major difference about the interpretation of Article 197 of the Treaty and a major interinstitutional problem . #% They have difficulty in getting their insurance extended for that temporary stay and having insurance extended for up to 12 months . #% Europe has a fragmented and inadequate equity market . #% We certainly have a majority in this House and I should like to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs of the other political groups , particularly Mr Bowis , Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes for the work they have done right through since the original White Paper . #% All they are left with is to resort to civil disobedience , and civil disobedience can quickly break down into civil disorder . #% All of that is to be commended . #% Madam President , today 's debate is the culmination of a long process which began in the days of the BSE epidemic . #% in writing . - As elected politicians , we must listen to the people - all the people . #% Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I want to congratulate the European Ombudsman , Mr Söderman , on his excellent first report . #% He renamed the days of the week . #% I extend congratulations to you , Mr President , in your former capacity as president of that conciliation group - plus Mrs Smet and Mr Rocard . #% Unless you can advise me to the contrary that they have now been received , I hope that we can send a gentle but nonetheless firm reminder to the Commission to honour its promises . #% This is a very dangerous precedent against all forms of natural justice . #% However , in the same week as we gave Mr Gusmão the Sakharov Prize , we must be careful not to drop our guard too far . #% It has to have political support , and I hope that we , together , have put in place the appropriate mechanism to ensure that we achieve that result . #% Another worrying development in the UK is the intention to let police and security cooperation measures slip through the Westminster Parliament without proper democratic scrutiny . #% I would ask the Commission to consider all the evidence , when the studies are completed , and perhaps hold a seminar or a wider discussion on what measures might be taken , as this is a disease which is increasingly of concern and it is spreading . #% Britain does not have to join this scheme , but watching our new government grapple with such issues will be interesting . #% So I would advocate that , in terms of our position here in Europe , we need to ensure that our industries move forward in a way auspicious to achieving the potential that they undoubtedly possess . #% That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund . #% We live daily with the problem of the victims of new variant CJD , to which the rapporteurs refer . #% Indeed , that is my third point : Europe has a key role to play here in disseminating best practice as to how best we tackle the transport challenge . #% A freight train is not . #% The EU , although understandably eager to trade with China , must not compromise on its commitment to fundamental human rights , which include freedom of expression and conscience and access to a free media . #% In my part of London - Brent , Harrow , Hounslow , Ealing , I could go on - we found that the opposite policy of respect for peoples ' differences , respect for their different religions , respect for different practices and heritage , is a much better way of incorporating minorities into societies . #% This is not so much integration as assimilation . #% I suspect that it is all over . #% This has appeared again this year in the guidelines . #% I think this skews the common position a little and , unless someone can convince me otherwise , I would have grave reservations about Amendment No 11 . #% The issue has long been problematic , mainly because of the national differences at governmental level , rather than the issues directly originating from Parliament , but compromises produced in Parliament have been both efficient and expedient in terms of their approach and are very welcome . #% This is also the reason why we can not accept the excessive restrictions implied by some amendments adopted in committee , especially those that seek to hide the responsibilities of the operators . #% It is , of course , the strength of our petition system that it allows individuals to bring such events to our attention when the European institutions or legal framework have not assisted as they would have wished or expected . #% But action is also needed to deliver both integration and interoperability if passenger railways are to develop to their full potential and if rail freight is , frankly , to survive . #% 
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I spent most of my early political years fighting against dangerous individuals like Mr Cohn-Bendit . #% It creates no additional military capabilities , just duplicative and divisive structures from which important allies are deliberately excluded . #% Madam President , it is good that you are in the chair today ; I thank you for your work in the negotiations between Parliament and the Commission . #% Some countries , like France , have a whole-herd slaughter policy which may reassure consumers , despite its lack of scientific basis and a risk of underreporting . #% There do need to be changes to the European Arrest Warrant , but fundamentally it has been a success . #% Nevertheless we all wish the summiteers in Seville every success in the challenges that lie ahead . #% Two weeks ago I attended the EU-Cyprus Joint Parliamentary Committee , and while there was little optimism , there was a real desire for the two communities to be united on 1 May . #% We are seeking information and not the resignation of the Commission as some have rumoured . #% I would also like to congratulate the Council on resolving the issues relating to the financing of the closure of Ignalina power station . #% Finally , we have to ensure that organisations that receive funding support get the information in good time , so that money is spent efficiently as well as effectively . #% A number of large multinational companies are investing heavily in biotechnology , developing products which could be of great value to the human race , particularly in helping raise agricultural output and thereby tackling food shortages in parts of the world where they exist . #% It is perhaps the most important task of the Commission to maintain free competition and make the market work across the European Union . #% Co-operation in this domain is a positive way to limit the negative effects that a few hooligans have on the game . #% Proper economic policy coordination reaching well beyond the policing role of the stability pact should ensure that gradual fiscal consolidation in the different Member States is combined with the preservation of key public spending in growth areas and key social policies . #% We need proactive labour markets . #% It may be that he was being hounded by it and mentally tortured . #% I welcome Mr Duisenberg ' s clarification on this issue today . #% The first is to say that we are letting people off the hook without allowing them to fulfil their obligations . #% Can you tell me if you are prepared to do that ? #% Under a fair voting system , the UK Independence Party could gain representation in the British Parliament and use it eventually to bring about our desired goal : Britain 's unconditional withdrawal from the European Union . #% In relation to paragraph 9 of the resolution , which refers to opening up the market in postal and passenger services , it is important that a true cost-benefit assessment is applied there too . #% If any one country wants to hold out until the last possible moment , they do so at their own risk and not at the risk of all the other accession countries , because we must be prepared to agree as each country is prepared to agree . #% Madam President , I am afraid I must raise this issue again . #% However , I am concerned that shoppers and small and medium-sized enterprises will not have smaller notes in their hands until `` e-day '' itself . #% In giving help as humanitarians , we hope that we are giving an example as Europeans too . #% It is technically possible to upgrade them , but in many cases it would be cheaper to build new gas plants and retro-fit these stations with exhaust scrubbers . #% The British also accept that they have a responsibility to ensure that the citizens of Gibraltar can be represented in this place . #% However , the EU is looking at ways of facilitating the crossing of external borders for bona fide third country nationals ; after all , good fences make for good neighbours in my opinion . #% Neighbouring sheep became infected . #% Start the negotiations and then come back to us with a reasonable compromise . #% But Europe has showed you how to maintain a viable post office offering a universal service of excellent quality at an affordable price . #% Just one very brief suggestion for improving the general ambience of the place as long as we do have to come here . #% Indeed , it is very unclear how funds can be made available for Somalia from an EDF envelope from which it does not even benefit . #% Those guarantee an absolute requirement for reporting on management conduct and financial operation in a DG at least twice a year , specifically to the responsible Commissioner , so that Commissioners will in future continue to be au fait with the practical operational management of the directorate-general , as well as bearing their straightforward and obvious political responsibilities . #% Both should now know better and work to consolidate a new Atlantic alliance . #% Next I would like to remind colleagues that the interest groups - the patient groups who are most likely to be affected by this measure and to benefit from it - strongly support the measure . #% The President-in-Office is quite right to cast doubt on some of the forecasts of job losses , about which I am extremely sceptical . #% This issue will come up when we discuss Mr Ferri ' s proposal later . #% Mr President , earlier this year I visited Galicia to see the environmental catastrophe that was the wreck of the Prestige . #% Too often , we suspect , Member States sign up to green laws because it looks good to do so , and opposing or moderating them is seen as politically insensitive . #% Parliament had a chance to show its relevance to people and missed it in prime time . #% The Commission proposal almost achieves that . #% There will be an amendment from the PPE-DE and PSE Groups to Paragraphs 6 and 7 , to remove the figures , to delete Paragraph 7 , and to put in a statement which will mention our rights again , because this is what this debate is all about . #% I have been approached by organisations ranging from the National Farmers Union to the Federation of Master Builders , which are deeply worried about the impact on their businesses . #% I would like to add another angle to that , namely the question of the three or four Member States which at the moment do not seek to join the Schengen arrangement and which are insisting on retaining the right to exercise border controls because they do not accept that non-citizens of the Union have the right of free movement . #% Mr President , the EU 's shambolic liberalisation of the energy market has already resulted in gross distortions . #% I welcome the Commissioner 's assurance that a suitable amendment allowing for reference to Parliament at any process of review will be introduced . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I would like to congratulate you on being elected although I feel that this morning it has been more like a papal inauguration . #% Mr Blokland said that we should not include Turkey . #% Whilst we know that this payment may not change their situation overnight , it will go indirectly towards helping by relieving pressure on our Government 's own budget . #% Democracy has been cancelled in Eritrea . #% The value of the Krona has shot up against the euro , and the costs of employment and premises are both having an impact . #% However , there is growing concern about what is happening to minors - unaccompanied or separated at arrival . #% So , in our resolution tomorrow we are not so much addressing ourselves to the people of Turkey or to the Turkish establishment as to the person currently in charge , Mr Erbakan himself , not only as regards the internal situation in his country but also as regards Cyprus . #% It is also important , especially for schemes relating to the self-employed , that it is understood that the information provided by the different countries should be comparable . #% The global fund represents a bold new approach - fast-moving , participatory and accountable . #% New technologies will require new legal rights to be identified . #% I very much hope , Commissioner , that we will disseminate this kind of information in Zimbabwe because those people trying to mount an opposition campaign will be heartened by the kind of information that we have had from you today and I think that would be important . #% Was it brought up and , if so , what was said ? #% This is a wide and diverse group with a lot of political philosophies , which stretch across the whole range , but they have in common the fact that they all have a political mandate , they have all been supported by thousands , indeed often millions of people in various ballot boxes in different countries . #% We must put safety first and make sure that GMOs do not enter the food chain unseen by the back door . #% It is anything but ; it is a tyranny run by religious extremists . #% So , from the point of view of my group , we are not supporting any amendments . #% We need to report back on the effectiveness of the pilot before the end of this year , so that the necessary amendments and extensions can be made to the scheme if it is proving to be the valuable contribution to the conservation of fish stocks we all want to achieve . #% You know , they are beginning to understand that the game is up and yet , in their desperation to

and higher-quality product . #% 
I am particularly pleased that the report now includes the integration of carbon emission reduction targets and support for renewable solar and wind energies on board vessels . #% It is an affront to liberty , democracy , accountability and natural human rights . #% Who is going to compensate organic producers whose crops become contaminated and lose their value ? #% Who said what , which countries were invited or present , will never be known by the public . #% Secondly , so far as appropriate involvement of Parliament in CFSP measures is concerned , what concerned us most was to how to get Parliament fully involved in consultation and information on how the monies will be spent by the Council . #% The three institutions of the European Union must cooperate and it would be very interesting to have the both the Council ' s and the Commission ' s view on the need to have a strong European parliamentary presence in these negotiations . #% I am pleased that the Council has recognised that it has to speed through the issue of tractors , because the lack of a harmonised type-approval process for a very important sector is scandalous , and Member States should be ashamed of their foot-dragging on this . #% It is regrettable again that we did that in an amendment because without a peace process , we will never see an end to the serious disruption in the Middle East . #% However , in the context where those anti-Europeans in my country and others portray the European Union as one massive bureaucracy-producing machine spewing out regulations , it is incumbent upon all of us to point out that , when we get it right , European legislation is an exercise in cutting red tape , relieving burdens on business , providing one set of rules for the common market , one patent , one registration for a trademark , one form to fill in , one fee to pay instead of 25 . #% Mr President , I should like to start by echoing some of the concerns of my colleague , Mr Wynn , at the paucity of solid measures being introduced to deal with unemployment . #% This is a shambles and it can not go on . #% Following the normal practice within my committee , this year I have used the matters that we found during our discharge procedure to draw some budgetary amendments to get what the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to see from the Commission and other institutions . #% We want real British influence and perhaps then we can give the Third World a real sporting chance . #% Maybe now , thanks to our not being defeated at Cancún , we have the momentum - the sense that we are going forward again - to make the changes that are necessary . #% I do not believe there is a contradiction . #% Perhaps the Commissioner might care to address that point in some way in the near future . #% I wonder whether the President-in-Office could indicate whether he agrees with us that we need European settlement of the Constitution before Turkey and Croatia are able to accede . #% As Mrs Evans said , it is not yet clear what impact the future negotiation on GATS will have on service provision and which aspects of health care and other care for the elderly will be put into any EU offer for discussion under the World Trade Organisation 's agreements . #% Those who perhaps are in fear of authority are especially vulnerable . #% The Court of Justice has been asked to determine whether the current rules are compatible with the Treaty provisions on free movement of goods and services . #% I thank you for you support . #% Do you look for the technological developments of the future ? #% As regards carrying out studies , I am afraid that the point made by my colleague , Commissioner Liikanen , applies specifically here , too , namely the budget line problem , insofar as the family policy project line is currently blocked . #% The next step must be the national plan , published quickly and fully responding to the Accession Partnership programme . #% I know the Commissioner is not responsible for distributing the aid that these countries need , but something has to be done in order to rebuild confidence in the very short time available to us between now and Hong Kong . #% My first point is that we are looking at a significant change in the process of doing things where , firstly , we have a definition of Commission policy priorities , secondly we are trying to ensure the right match between tasks and measures for 2003 and , thirdly , that we welcome this idea of having a strengthened institutional dialogue so that we can ensure that the budget is actually collectively decided . #% Before leaving , I and some colleagues were able to visit Potsdam where of course the conference took place where President Truman , Prime Minister Churchill - bizarrely replaced by Mr Atley mid-conference - and Marshal Stalin agreed to confirm the Yalta division of Europe . #% Secondly , we welcome the stipulation that Member States are to examine the qualifications already recognised in one Member State which have been obtained in a third country . #% The committee therefore proposes , firstly that the ECB should publish a summary minute giving both sides of the argument , for and against monetary actions . #% The people who have the greatest need of our protection now are the small producers and we should help them . #% I hope that these considerations can be taken into account tomorrow . #% It is a pity the Presidency is not represented here today . #% Having those benchmarks and star ratings will encourage commercial firms to pick them up and to make their websites more accessible which will really deliver the sorts of benefits we are looking for . #% Mr President , I understand . #% Ten years ago , I submitted a report to Parliament on prospects for gas supply in Europe and was criticised by the industry for suggesting that we could become over-dependent on gas if it provided over 25 % of our energy requirements . #% Opponents of Turkey 's membership try to equate ` European ' with ` Christian ' . #% The EU must stand up to the outrageous US bullying to undermine the court . #% For these reasons and more , British Conservatives voted against this report . #% The growing number of cases and the fact that they come from so many Member States - Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium , Spain and Ireland , to name but a few - must be a huge concern for us all . #% I hope they will command the support of the House . #% I should like to congratulate Mrs Stauner on the courage which she has shown in getting her report - although not much of it is in its original form - through this Parliament . #% It is crucial for the Foreign Office in the UK to send their top people to the service rather than their discards . #% It is for the same reasons that we must press ahead with the enlargement of the European Union . #% As the President-in-Office has said : they are telling us that Europe is not being listened to . #% We are very concerned that the European Central Bank will be almost beyond the touch of the citizens of the European Union . #% Most of those employed find themselves in SMEs , which form a vital part of the European economy . #% Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House . #% All this growth is due to immigration and births to immigrants . #% If you doubt this click on to their website and make your own judgement . #% Finally , members of the Council should establish a better rapport with members of their national parliaments . #% I am reassured by your energy in that direction . #% Most important of all , however , is the pressing fact that four years into the DDA , the agenda is not delivering for the poor of the world . #% We need human health to be ensured and we need animal testing to be stopped . #% Public opinion will query why our national leaders are frightened of their own shadow on Europe and fearful of putting the argument for the Constitution in a positive and trenchant way that embraces the European dimension . #% Mr President , the Commissioner did not answer my third question about the accession of these 10 countries to the European Economic Area . #% Mrs Berès is right to include in her report references to a Treaty change in recognition of public service . #% Lastly , even when sportsmen are found to have cheated , the real winners are denied recognition for their victory because of delays attributable to the testing system . #% The companies making new engines go out of business , but those refurbishing old engines continue to make a lot of money . #% I see no reason whatsoever why we should make an exemption where , what starts off as a little outlet doing no harm , a brace or two of birds here or there , ends up as another supply route . #% Because of these stark facts , President-in-Office , I wonder whether your answer , while I agree with it in total , is enough . #% First the Prime Minister downgraded the Hampton Court meeting to one day . #% I have tabled some more for the vote tomorrow , along similar lines . #% Let me give you one example : I am dealing with the case of a family where the mother is Irish , the father British , and their daughter was born in Holland , but for the last eight years they have lived in Spain - very European . #% The total failure of the hearings of the Commissioners that went through this Parliament has cast a very dark shadow over your Commission . #% As far as I can see , this House acts mainly as a rubber stamp , but here again I could get one of those in a stationery shop for approximately # 3.00 or EUR5 .00 , which would be slightly cheaper . #% Amendment 98 ensuring the protecting of unaccompanied minors ; #% 
The first such responsibility is to respect the territorial integrity of its neighbours such as Ukraine and Georgia and abandon the insulting ` near abroad ' concept . #% We must strike a positive note if we are to try to break through the situation . #% Is the big ministerial ` jamboree ' the best way to continue the negotiations ? #% We must not do anything to harm the job prospects of young people in Britain . #% I call upon the Council to honour its commitment to EBA by implementing no delay or safeguard mechanisms . #% We can be sure that whatever money we have in this programme will be directed at youth and will , in the long-term , be money well spent . #% There are a number of reasons why this is important to us from the perspective of European content . #% This EUR 561 million increase in Structural Fund appropriations will allow us to honour properly historic commitments and ensure the new Agenda 2000 programmes hit the ground running . #% There are issues about the timescales of consultation which our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has certainly suffered from . #% We need to make cuts in the agricultural budget which is in dire need of reform . #% This proposal being considered here tonight , together with other proposals from the Commission , aims to create an internal market in rail services . #% I thought very carefully about coming this week . #% Central to the issue of combating IUU fishing are improvements in traceability , both of vessels and of the fish that they catch or transport . #% This particular ruling applied only to environmental law , but it has left the way wide open for the Commission to apply it to other areas . #% A social conscience means looking at what actually works and how we can really help the poor , rather than clinging to an outdated socialist ideology which , as Mr Zaleski said , lost its legitimacy after being imposed on Central and Eastern Europe for so many years . #% But perhaps more important and appropriate for us is the fact that the economic partnership agreement negotiations will begin this month . #% We have a compromise here and in any compromise we do not all get what we want . #% A Member of this House is actually a declared candidate in this general election . #% Kofi Annan has described the AIDS crisis as being an issue of weapons of mass destruction . #% I am sure you are looking at that , because that could be a better and possibly a cheaper method of disposing of these cattle . #% I like that : I have always argued that they should have . #% I hope that the House will support this report , which seeks to make the regulation far less of a blunt instrument than that fashioned by the original proposal . #% I welcome Mr Perry 's dogged work on behalf of those petitioners , and confirm that my Group will support the report . #% However , we also dealt with technical issues : clarifying definitions on the environment or supplying a solution on the issue of unfair competition , and then grappling with the relationship between European conflict of law rules and internal market instruments . #% I understand that Europe needs to look critically at its current economic and financial stability plans in order to move forward together , towards a stronger , more closely intertwined economy that fulfils its potential as a global economic superpower . #% Mr President , I would like to protest at the leniency shown by President Musharraf of Pakistan to the television confession of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan . #% The young couple Ahmadu Ibrahim and Fatima Usman face the same prospect , as does an older man accused of rape . #% I agree with Mr Wibe that this case falls within the cases where the European Parliament has a margin of discretion . #% Thankfully the proposals of Kofi Annan seem to be a sound constitutional basis for such a reconciliation . #% We already have enough and I believe they are adequate and effective . #% I would say to some of my colleagues in the committee who moved a variety of amendments aimed at the further restyling of the title of this authority : the priorities are set out in the report as amended . #% We have heard some discussion of delay - delay by a few weeks . #% It will certainly have our support . #% Therefore , we support the rapporteur 's view that there is a need for a wider body to evaluate the working of the action programme . #% We need to give them certainty and encourage development and investment . #% The need to have better coordination with other cross-cutting strategies like Lisbon is well established , but we also need to have better coordination within the sustainable development strategy itself . #% We are actually looking for funds to implement programmes decided by the Council or by our institution in the budgetary procedure . #% Mr President , what is at stake in this debate is whether the EU 's commitment to sustainable development in theory , actually means something in practice , whether when push comes to shove , we are prepared to make some very difficult decisions . #% I heard what Commissioner de Palacio said . #% I would like the record to show that I only voted once but I voted in the wrong spot . #% Who can be against such a simple and effective measure ? #% We share his concern that the regulations are overly complex and make our job , as a Parliament , of scrutinising the budget very difficult . #% The ECR Group therefore supports a deeper strategic political and economic partnership with Tajikistan based on a commitment of progress towards openness , democracy and higher standards of human rights . #% We have produced , I believe , a balanced report that will continue to put pressure on the authorities in Valencia . #% I trust this House will give every encouragement to Bulgaria and its new government on the path to EU and NATO accession and support my resolution . #% Many people not used to dealing with high finance find that when you start adding on the zeros and the billions it is very difficult to imagine just how all-encompassing this industry is . #% He is a student leader who was recently sentenced to 52 years of imprisonment , and this has now been increased to 59 years . #% That is why I welcome the commitment from my own government in the United Kingdom and from the Finnish Government , as well as the recommendation of the High Level Panel of the United Nations to champion an international arms trade treaty . #% We are calling for that on diabetes , particularly type 2 diabetes , and the Commission itself is calling for something along those lines for mental health , one of the biggest challenges of our time . #% Sadly , this homophobia is often stirred up by governments and their media mouthpieces . #% So , for example , are we going to support proposals that appear to be on the table , according to what is on the blogosphere , that MP3 players and laptops can be confiscated at borders ? #% I particularly welcome the recommendations regarding fishing gear , especially the introduction of minimum mesh sizes to be used in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea , and the prohibition of towed dredges and trawl nets below the thousand-metre mark . #% Mr President , I appreciate very much that the Commissioner is tiptoeing through a minefield , walking on egg shells and is certainly trying to do her best to see that we rescue something from the first-class programmes we have organised over many years . #% Free allocations were a good start , but proved pretty weak in practice . #% If you accept this restrictive deadline , more embryos are inevitably destroyed to create useful and viable stem cell lines . #% If sustainability really is a key issue for the EU and if the Swedish Presidency is really serious about openness , could the Presidency tell us if first of all it envisages a formalised dialogue between Parliament and the 133 Committee , and secondly if it is ready to propose revisions to the composition of that committee . #% It is the opportunity for greater long-term prosperity . #% Hauliers in the UK complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage , and that is true . #% Indeed , these definitions could well prove to be the difference between companies not fully understanding the system - and hence not bothering to apply - and SMEs having much greater confidence in approaching the Commission with bids for their own innovative projects . #% Many of us will remember how anxious members of the public were at that time and just how long the radioactive contamination lasted in certain places , such as the English Lake District , where soil conditions and heavy rainfall caused the ground to be contaminated for many years . #% Oddly , this theme of our citizens ' access to justice in civil and commercial matters was not mentioned . #% Minutes of meetings of its Monetary Policy Committee , including voting records and reasoning , are now published after about six weeks . #% Of course it would be helpful if all the Member States had similar statutory requirements of financial accounts , and that is something which is yet to come . #% Worldwide many more lives have been lost . #% Mr President , one word of explanation . #% Children are at risk in many of these states and this all underlines the very pressing need for economic policies to be pursued which will alleviate poverty and will not increase it . #% 
As a consequence , the UK consumers enjoy access to a relatively wide-range of products with minimal restrictions and competitive prices . #% I am sorry to disabuse the President-in-Office but I am afraid his reply to my question was inadequate . #% The report of that group will be ready in a few weeks ' time . #% Trade preferences for Pakistan at this time may perhaps help stop that happening . #% I hope the Council and the Commission will now do everything possible to assist Indonesia in getting back to the negotiating table with GAM and get those talks started as soon as possible . #% We look to you and to the officers of this House to uphold our rules and orders . #% The former Conservative British Government , a few years ago , in the dispute over mad cow disease blocked all decision-taking in the Council that required unanimity in pursuit of a particular dispute . #% The European Commission published a new set of guidelines on breast cancer screening and diagnosis in April . #% In particular , pre-emptory withdrawal of troops from Iraq would simply further threaten the security of the Iraqi people . #% So , my question to the Commission is this : when it comes to practical forms , when it comes to actually dealing with what I hope will be a positive outcome from Bonn , how does the Council pursue harmonised energy taxation at the same time as dealing with enlargement , which makes the possibility of unanimity so much more difficult to achieve if it we were actually to have harmonised environmental taxation of a sort which is worth having . #% I call on the Commission to press the French authorities to take action . #% Because each and every country is slowly waking up to the reality that one size does not suit all in the eurozone , and neither now will one citizenship . #% The truth is quite different . #% I note that Mr Byrne said that the Commission had banned the import of poultry meat and poultry products . #% We are being told that our government can not afford to pay us a decent pension unless we work until we are 70 . #% If we think that the Commission does not need to adopt an implementing measure at the time or of the style that the Commission envisages , and we object to it , the Commission should be able to withdraw it . #% It has also been a pleasure to work with him . #% There is much still to be done and the process of reform will continue for many years . #% -- Mr President , I agree with everybody who has said that we are facing a veterinary crisis which must be tackled urgently . #% We must also improve cooperation with third countries so that EU citizens travelling outside the EU to commit sex crimes against children can be identified , stopped , prosecuted and extradited as required . #% I am sure we shall all benefit greatly from following his recommendations . #% I would like to emphasise that the safety of nuclear plants and other such industrial installations is primarily a national competence and responsibility . #% I would hope that all the political groups opt for the maximum of EUR 200 million , albeit spread over two years . #% Of course , they already had a flag , and they already had an anthem , but they went about building a new state . #% They produce their own colouring book and encourage children to eat more and more of this product according to how much they are colouring in . #% Mr President , I too welcome what my colleagues have been able to do in the committee and I salute the real heroes of this report - Mr Medina , Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt - for the major work they have done , and also those in the Commission who have interacted with us in an extremely positive way over the past six months . #% Those are two categorical questions where I would like answers from the Commission . #% This is not to say that the EU should start to be responsible for children 's policy but we could start by ensuring that EU laws are child-proof . #% We await the results of the official Russian investigations into the blasts before attributing the blame for these atrocities to any particular group . #% However , we believe , and I personally believe , that farmers need security . #% I emphasise , however , that the Commission and Parliament have the same objective : to maximise the speed and efficiency of the Commission ' s efforts on the ground in Kosovo for the people of the region . #% These are serious matters and reflect our citizens ' deep concerns but we should appreciate the full context of the UK announcement , acknowledging the subsidiarity principle to which the Commissioner referred . #% Since corrupt practices in the award of contracts for development projects represents a major threat to the provision of good governance , would you agree , Mr Maystadt , that it is crucial that the EIB examine its due diligence procedures , with respect not only to the Lesotho project , but also to all future projects , and will you report back to Parliament on its findings ? #% I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes , to post-conflict reconstruction , and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world , particularly in developing countries . #% We have to improve intra-Community trade in this area so that we do not become more and more dependent on the United States . #% The European Trade Union Confederation has called on us to make sure that every step - and they do say every step - taken to implement the Kyoto targets is carefully evaluated . #% Now we need another commitment . #% I will not rehearse all the many good things that other speakers have referred to that rightly find their place in the Regulations . #% They are not , and it was on this basis that the Supreme Court petitioners called for the releases of detainees that we have seen recently . #% We also have to be sure that when Europe goes to the WTO round we can fight our corner and face up not only to the United States , but Third World countries . #% I thank the Commissioner for that reply which I found very interesting . #% There is no doubt about that and Council should be in no doubt about that whatsoever . #% He himself never referred to it as the Spinelli draft Treaty . #% I very much support the measures outlined in this report to prevent a future outbreak of foot and mouth disease on the scale experienced in the United Kingdom , and the West Midlands region I represent . #% We have been extremely gratified by the results , and the people we have helped have also been pleased . #% I therefore voted to abstain on this report . #% We now have a simple and clear way of moving from dual pricing to unit pricing . #% I asked quite a lot more , such as the relative ranking of the different funds and the proportions in which they would be used . #% To avoid the will of Parliament being negated , I request that you send a formal request to the Presidents of the Council and the Commission that they should abstain from taking any decisions before the Court has given its judgment , especially during this electoral period . #% It is very good to see her back this evening I hope in good health and ready to face the fray of the next Parliamentary Assembly . #% One of our so-called colleagues in this House , Jean-Marie Le Pen , is reported in an interview in the neo-fascist paper as having stated that the Nazi occupation of France was not particularly inhumane . #% Mr Pęk was vehemently against this : European taxpayers will pay . #% Between our rapporteur and our draftsman , they produced a very sound report . #% On safer car fronts , I think it is worth pointing out how clearly the rapporteur has made the case for the Commissioner to come forward with a directive . #% Is this speculative ? #% Economic governance is a trap and moreover , it has no mandate . #% It is the first time that the Parliament has acted in codecision in the area of asylum , immigration and border control . #% A very good place to start would be the new directive on packaging waste . #% To return to the debate , I have to say that there have been times in the last few years when I have felt that the initials CFSP have not stood for common foreign and security policy but for coreless , fudge and sclerotic posturing . #% I think we can do that . #% Mrs Novak 's explanatory statement helpfully highlights the role envisaged for the national Europass centres to coordinate all the activities laid down by this decision . #% In 1994 research was carried out by both the CAA and the FAA which clearly indicated that the difference between getting out of the aircraft or not depended on assertive , highly-trained and highly-effective cabin crew . #% This is a principle we have also seen operating in the proposals on capital adequacy and solvency margins in relation to bank and investment companies . #% Tell us the truth ! #% I would add that Ireland has just voted to allow the entry of applicant countries into the EU . #% I know that steps are being taken to enable this to occur and I very much support and welcome them because without them WTO membership can not be a success . #% 
So we welcome the proposal to set up a special group within the Advisory Committee and we welcome the rapporteur 's suggestion that it should have more resources . #% In the longer term , Europe 's farming must become less dependent on international trade and more self-reliant . #% Ghana has only 1500 doctors for its population of 20 million . #% The other message comes from the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Verhofstadt , and deals with a rather more robust approach to the current operations in that area and also his more forward thinking approach towards the future of Afghanistan . #% The tragedy is that its very breadth confirms how widespread human rights problems still are throughout the world and how vital it is that those of us who care about such issues must make sure our voices are heard and that they prevail . #% A nightmare ! #% Any legislation that this Parliament adopts and pushes through the Commission could have a detrimental effect on industry if it is not put through correctly . #% Secondly , about a year ago I took the initiative to invite Mr Lacoste , the chairman of the Nuclear Regulators ' Association , to come to the Industry Committee . #% Apparently you want us to pay more . #% The principle also concerns water charging . #% Talk of Malta jumping to the front of the queue - which I have heard in Parliament - is nonsense . #% The Council did not address its responsibilities at the last revision of the Treaty and it must do so either by an inter-institutional agreement or at the next revision of the Treaty . #% It seems to me that , whilst Labour Members are fully in support of the resolution , we have to accept our responsibility and acknowledge the maturity of our position . #% It is not in any way to challenge the competence of the regulator or his staff in Ukraine . #% I find it difficult to believe that after nearly three weeks it has been impossible to clarify , let alone hear , the charges against the 12 Britons . #% It is illogical for us to have a situation where a warrant for arrest is not applicable across the whole of the European Union . #% There , and everywhere else , the basic provisions of Directive 93/43 have yet to be complied with . #% That is why the presence of the UN force , as authorised by Resolution 1706 , is so vital . #% Their closure several years ahead of time was not necessary ; it was certainly not on safety grounds . #% This is why I fully endorse this report . #% First of all , there is one case which I think provided us with very little difficulty or discussion . #% As one said to me , we had a right to assume the rules on solvency were being respected and that we were not operating , as it were , in the Wild West , where rules could be ignored . #% The Lisbon Summit foresaw a key coordinating role for the European Council itself . #% Mr President , when I first heard that the European Union wanted to tell me how long I could work each week , I finally realised it had lost its collective mind . #% EPLP members abstained on the Perry report because we do not believe the report to be a balanced view or assessment of the facts . #% Something must be done quickly . #% But I am also aware that this is a poker game and I am a rotten poker player . #% We also decided to intensify discussions with other EU institutions and with other international public sector organisations in order to develop these proposals further . #% Moreover , if you want your group - the PPE-DE Group - to take that line , I must tell you that it is not just a simplification of the situation , it is a distortion , a gross misrepresentation of what is in the report . #% We know that there will not be a free trial ; it will not be open to the public and we have no idea whether these people will have representation . #% In EU Member States , traditional implementation of corporal punishment is rightly banned , and let us hope that Malaysia one day will follow our enlightened example . #% I am delighted to see that , although I do not agree with everything the rapporteur says in her report , there is an acknowledgement - in paragraph 8 of the resolution - of the harmful effects of ` high statutory non-wage costs on labour ' , which leads to a reluctance to hire people . #% Given the current discussion on large-scale immigration , and in particular the challenges faced by integrating the existing Muslim minorities in our countries , a major concern inevitably will be unrestricted freedom of movement of Turkish workers . #% We have to tell people the truth about what is in their food . #% We have seen a 40 % fall this last year in our income and yet we talk about such things as national envelopes and a renationalisation of the common agricultural policy , which strikes fear into people 's hearts in the United Kingdom because it allows governments to control the spending on agriculture . #% One or two amendments need to be addressed . #% That regulation provides for exceptions to access . #% It would be disastrous if we were left with the politics of retribution and recrimination where we could move towards common European standards . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs - and indeed the people of Wales , because I did not realize they were so concerned about the Commission 's welfare that they had elected someone to represent the Commission 's views in Parliament rather than their own ! #% I am going to deal specifically with whole-body vibration . #% Perhaps Mr Guellec is not bothered what those ordinary people think , as long as he can emphasise that his beloved EU Constitution strengthens the role of the regions . #% Acting in the way she has done - and I am being cheeky here - she is acting in the most European of ways . #% Maybe we can think about this question for the future . #% Mr President , I rise to speak on the same issue . #% All those involved in circles of human trafficking should certainly face stiff penalties , whether they are police officers , customs officials or civil servants . #% We do not know how it came in , but the Commission 's staff was very good at sorting it out . #% Mr President , I will begin with the controversial issue in this directive . #% Essex has 66 , 000 overseas and UK businesses providing 590 , 000 jobs . #% I rise because , although the Council position has not altered , the Romanian Government has put in a great deal of work , and I want to commend to the Council the report that came out just a few days ago from the independent group for international adoption analysis , which the Prime Minister commissioned . #% For those EU regions that are struggling to converge , relief from over-regulation would surely do much more good than any amount of handouts from the diminishing pool of Structural and Cohesion Funds . #% We have had problems of this sort in the past and managed through pressure to get some improvement . #% It is hard to find anyone who believes that the existing drugs policies are a success . #% It is so important now for the European Union to improve the focus and implementation of its strategy . #% Mr President , on the Brok report , I remain sceptical of the need to formally institute a CFSP or an ESDP . #% The time has now come for the governments of Europe to wake up . #% That it is not a threat , it is a statement of intent . #% That does not occur in the common fisheries policy and this document and the legislation that I hope will follow are all about making that happen . #% A Russia-Belarus state union treaty was ratified in 1999 , but in practice it has been largely ignored , while the single rouble currency union has been deferred to 2006 . #% Running through the report are three interlinked strands . #% I am sure that Parliament is properly under control for that period . #% What will be the content of their jobs in ten years ' time if the EU continues on its present course ? #% It is a messy political compromise and nothing more . #% Mr President , 11 September showed us that the world we live in is very insecure . #% The future of the world can go to hell , frankly , just so long as we are protected ' . #% If Commissioner McCreevy will also listen to me -- everybody is having conversations while I am addressing them -- he , as the Commissioner , has a crucial responsibility to take this forward . #% If we are naive enough to believe that it will all come from flexibility , then we will have some long nights in conciliation when the matter has to be negotiated . #% 
Shortly after I was elected to this House , Mr President , one of my first pleasurable duties was to bring to the Parliament representatives from Dudley Chamber of Commerce and Industry , which was then in my constituency . #% Mr President , this is a most useful report on a very important issue . #% Given that the principal amendment fell , it seems to me now that the second amendment should fall also . #% In particular when it comes to packaging , there has to be some kind of uniform and level playing field across Europe , in which case we have to be realistic about what is achievable in central and eastern Europe in the foreseeable future . #% On the way here , I read an article in The Times , which again referred to the loss of habitat , the use of pesticides and the introduction of alien species that we have heard so much about . #% I say to my colleagues in this Chamber that one thing the people of Europe do not understand is why we oscillate between Brussels and Strasbourg . #% But it should not deflect the Commission from ensuring that the current CSR Forum that it is due to launch in October fully addresses the actions of European enterprises in developing countries . #% After all , your reform , Commissioner Kinnock , is going to have to be led from the top and we very much welcome the confirmation you have given about the way in which the top appointments have been handled . #% Madam President , my group welcomes the decision . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , well , it is all terribly simple really , is n't it ? #% Equally , in relation to repetitive strain injuries , I hope it will revisit the display screen directive - the directive does not even mention the computer mouse - and the directive on manual handling . #% I want to say to colleagues from Limburg that we have had that experience and we now have a thriving automotive industry in the United Kingdom ; we have more international car manufacturers assembling cars in the United Kingdom than any other country in the European Union . #% The services have advised me that this problem can be resolved by voting on the PSE and ALDE amendments as recital Ia ( new ) , rather than as amendments to recital I. I ask for your support on this , Mr President . #% The report puts forward ambitious proposals , as one would expect of the European Parliament . #% I would however like to pay tribute across the great political divide to the valiant work that Mrs Hautala has undertaken in order to try to cobble together some compromise . #% Allowing firms to compete with exchanges will lead to more choice for investors , more liquidity , narrower spreads , better prices and lower costs . #% I welcome the fact that the new Financial Regulation gives us the power to scrutinise these agencies ' accounts and I also welcome the cooperative way in which they all worked with the European Parliament in this process . #% They represent a significant step forward , tightening up on requirements for the use of specialist detergents , improving on the proposals for labelling of potential allergens , ensuring that consideration is given to the development of non-animal tests and setting the basis for proposals to eliminate phosphates , taking full account of scientific evidence . #% A readiness to apologise never comes amiss , so I particularly support that particular clause in the draft . #% Secondly , concerning coordination : what will the relationship be between this unit and the European Union special envoys ? #% The welfare of children must come first , not nationalism , not machismo but the welfare of the children . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the major development in the common foreign and security policy ( CFSP ) this year has undoubtedly been the establishment of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) . #% As a result , my colleagues and I have abstained on the final vote for this report . #% Will the President-in-Office confirm that the Council will take similar actions at such time ? #% Is he saying , as I think he is , that Turkey is vital to the success of the European defence initiative and we should take that into account ? #% Secondly , there is a problem with the definition of less-favoured area . #% I welcome the changes to the treatment of decommissioning funds in the main text , which was a very important issue . #% This is part of our social responsibility but we must retain benefits for farmers in the hills and other difficult terrain and we must ensure that benefit goes where it is required - not to the large , the rich or powerful . #% This also demonstrates the utter pointlessness of this Parliament and its committee system . #% Today , despite the fact that both the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment of this Parliament were asked to consider this extension , the Council has decided to ignore this House and change the legal basis for this decision , despite the fact that the amendments proposed were both practical and reasonable and could have been adopted under codecision . #% Accordingly , the rapporteur 's Amendment 29 is of enormous importance to those hundreds of thousands of Central and Eastern Europeans whose families or family members were executed , were deported or died in Stalin 's gulags , for no reason other than that their survival was judged to be a threat to the illegal occupation of their countries , agreed by Hitler and Stalin under the notorious Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact . #% I want the directive to fulfil those needs and I will endeavour to help the rapporteur to ensure , through the conciliation process , that it does so . #% I also want to thank Mrs Kuneva for her very positive response . #% Pressing ahead with a new trade round in the face of major opposition from the majority of developing countries is not helpful . #% Mr President , I turn to the case of Raghbir Singh Johal who is a journalist , editor of a Punjabi newspaper , who has lived peacefully in my constituency for many years and is known to me . #% In other words , policy should be implemented along the lines of a directive rather than a regulation . #% We in this House must remind ourselves that we can not be selective in the application of principle . #% I will try to make this a simple presentation . #% If Khin Nyunt is transferred to chief administrator of the Burmese windsurfing squad to visit my own constituency in Weymouth in 2012 , he should not be given a visa . #% To achieve this requires a boarding aid , a lift or a ramp , because a low-floor bus on its own is not enough . #% What is clear is that the European courts and European legislation are in conflict . #% Those aspects so often let down our good intentions in Europe and contribute to the public doubts about Europe 's ability to be good news for them . #% Mr President , I would like to join with you in thanking the Irish presidency for everything it has done so far , in particular in ensuring the success of this enormously historic occasion of the welcoming of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , which , as other speakers have said , will go down in the annals of history . #% We can , however , make a reasonable estimate , and on that basis , we can forecast that the budgetary impact of the above measures will be modest . #% Hopefully , we might see some curbing of that . #% Duality is something that will help to promote the proper use of medicines for species that are not found across the European Union . #% I hope your generosity will extend to the daunting task that I have of replacing Mrs Oomen-Ruijten - because of her sad illness - as the shadow rapporteur on this measure . #% That is right and it has my support . #% I will always vote to reflect that view and try to end the mindless and expensive perigrinations around Europe that John Major 's government imposed on the Parliament at the Edinburgh Summit in 1992 . #% I regret to say that the strategy papers reviewed so far show the transport sector receiving 35 % and macroeconomic support 25 % of all programmable resources . #% I can see why some professional organisations in some other Member States would be opposed to that , but it has worked effectively for very many years in Ireland as well as the UK . #% Please do not confine millions like me to a second-class citizenship simply because of our appearance and by ignoring our contribution . #% The only consolation I have is that the turnout in the last American presidential elections was only 50 % . #% I always questioned Western legitimisation and acceptance of Hamas candidates committed to armed struggle and to wiping the state of Israel off the map . #% What we have to do now is look again at the situation in Malta and judge it on the same basis as any other country . #% But here we are about to insist that nickel is not used in the new euro coins . #% I say ` possibly detracting ' , because tonight we look to the Commissioner for reassurance that Parliament will continue to be fully involved in the future work when new conventions are negotiated and new or old ones ratified by the Community . #% When it comes to humanitarian aid , subsidiarity may well mean bringing it up a level and having it coordinated at Community level rather than Member States trying to do it in a devolved way . #% Given the importance of the shipping industry as an economic generator and its pivotal relevance for being well-administered to maintain the highest forms of safety at sea , the Socialist Group are concerned to batten down all the safety hatches . #% It is not sufficient where we need to be able to have a further process of scrutiny and inspection of damaging materials that may be inserted very early on into the manufacture of animal feed . #% As the Vice-President of this House responsible for transparency , I have not always found it an easy subject , but I do believe that now we have the chance to do better and to reach out even further to our citizens . #% What we need to know is what the impact will be , how many jobs will be lost , and then a decision can be made about what to do . #% We all know people whose lives could be transformed on the basis of stem cell research . #% First , in section 7.6 the Commissioner says rightly that public financial support to enterprises by Member States should be made subject to compliance with ethical standards . #% We in Scotland know how painful it is for the fishing industry when crisis conditions are reached , but we can not solve problems in the EU by exporting them . #% Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi ' s report emphasises a number of key points such as the need to make business formation cheaper and quicker and the need to remove some of the barriers preventing entrepreneurs from benefiting from the risks of putting capital into starting up new businesses . #% 
It has few , if any , internal ethnic or religious problems , unlike some of its larger neighbours . #% We have a GBP 50 note which is worth about EUR 80 , but that is very rare . #% It actually gives the Commission and financial regulators a role in determining whether information is fairly presented . #% In simple terms , this means increasing the skills and mobility of Europe 's workforce , encouraging enterprise , helping small firms and improving EU regulation . #% I certainly hope that the IGC will be able to recognize the needs of islands . #% I am afraid that I myself will not be here at 5 p.m. , as I have another engagement this evening . #% Mr President , during the formal and informal debate on this issue over the last few weeks and months , both the Commission and the Council have indicated that it is not the business of the European Parliament to stick its nose into the substance of WTO cases . #% I have to inform him that all he needs do is to go to any of the municipalities in the Union and they will tell him how to do it . #% I am sorry , I do understand frustration , but my thoughts were : have you gone mad ? #% Just take the 2005 accounts : a team of independent forensic accountants have concluded that payments worth EUR 27 billion were simply not registered accurately in the accounts and such incredible unaccountability has produced some equally incredible and unacceptable consequences . #% I welcome the support for a collegiate approach to the Presidency . #% Mr President , may I begin by saying that I can not agree with anyone who suggests that the claims of most of the people who have been processed in the system in the United Kingdom are found to be fraudulent . #% Eight hours , as she has rightly said , should be the legal limit throughout the European Union for live animal transport . #% The comprehensive agreement establishes the ground rules for what promises to become a strong working relationship between us . #% Prime Minister Sharon , in spite of fierce Likud opposition , is pressing ahead with withdrawal of settlements from Gaza as a way of kick-starting the roadmap for peace in the Middle East again and bringing about a two-state solution . #% Deep in the Buitenweg report is Amendment No 2022 on Budget Line 250 and this makes a new proposal to allow in certain circumstances , individual expenses to be paid to particular petitioners if they feel it appropriate to come to Parliament to put their case . #% It is an extremely significant industry and , frankly , if we continue as we are going today in the way in which this industry is planning for the future , we are going to see substantial job losses in Europe . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that she has done on this , and I would also like to add my voice to that of Mr Evans and to support all the comments that he made on this report . #% At the same time gallant officers and soldiers are hung out to dry by a government-inspired system that cares little for their wellbeing but everything for its own political agenda ... #% This is only possible with a combination of renewable energy sources and nuclear energy . #% We can not understand the Commission 's readiness to propose only the minimum possible . #% I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately . #% The Commission text is sensible and practical . #% Each citizen has benefited from the single market by some EUR 6 000 a head in increased output . #% Scaremongering of this sort can only undermine public confidence in the bodies set up to protect our food and our health . #% I am going to be asking you whether the Commission is prepared to be very openminded and take on board some really very innovative suggestions that are going to come out not only at the IGC but after that concerning the way in which we deal with public services within the European Union ; the way in which Commissioners themselves deal with them ; and the way in which committees ' structures within Parliament deal with them , in order to achieve cooperation between Parliament and the Member States . #% This conciliation has seen 15 new provisions introduced into the common position , so it can not be maintained seriously that Parliament 's rights have been trampled on . #% Liner growth for example has been almost 7 % per annum throughout the world over the past ten years . #% Aung San Suu Kyi has today , in a video in this Parliament , spoken unequivocally about the need for economic sanctions , for a stop to all investments , an end to tourism , and for every possible measure to be taken to isolate that regime . #% Is that what the public wants ? #% The German Minister for European Affairs , Mr Gloser , may talk about sustainability and energy policy - although I have to say that how he keeps a straight face when he talks about the already failed Lisbon Agenda is quite beyond me . #% We need to think about the new opportunities afforded by wireless technologies , how the amount of information carried in our personal devices or mobile phones can be used in commercial transactions , but also about carrying our health records around with us in case of emergency and about areas where highly confidential data will be distributed . #% Having talked to British and European professional organisations , I therefore raised this in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , which asked me to produce an opinion . #% We are saying to the small retailers we are trying to help that this is the timetable within which , we hope now , this adjustment , with our assistance can be made for your benefit as well as that of European consumers . #% I believe the original Commission proposal is a very good one , and we were determined to resist changes to it . #% I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative . #% We have long lead times for planning and negotiation followed by rushed decisions concerning spending and implementation , consistently late payments both to Member States , regions and individual projects . #% We want this scheme to succeed , and if Member States are to start meeting their targets they must publish national allocation plans by March 2004 . #% I fear that some EU citizens who apply to one of these bodies only to be referred to another will fall by the wayside and give up . #% It was clear to me then and more importantly to everybody else in Jakarta that firstly there would be a resounding yes in a referendum and secondly that the army , or at least large sections of the army , would try to subvert that process by engaging in and encouraging terror . #% Homosexuality is illegal in Uganda as it is in many African countries . #% We need to make sure that these vital businesses are not hampered by red tape and bureaucracy , and I agree that the EU needs to renew its efforts to reduce administrative burdens . #% Well , I too have a dream . #% We also need to do something about the bail situation , not least by implementing the framework decision on supervision orders . #% The second point which will come through in our consideration of the telecom package , is that in this very fast-moving world there is concern within the industry and amongst investors that excessively rigid targets in terms of market share thresholds for investigation - and that can be too much or too little in many cases - should not be allowed to inhibit your consideration of areas where there is a genuine competitive issue at stake . #% Only at this point will the CFP fully come into force . #% Mr President , a number of Members would have noticed that at the last Strasbourg part-session there were a number of very close votes . #% The Commission 's proposal has been transformed , there will be a complete ban on animal testing within the EU and a ban on the sale of cosmetics tested on animals outside the EU , six years after entry into force . #% That is very true , but , when we consider how we are diminishing life on this planet , it is certainly worth at least some tears . #% Mr President , first our misguided rapporteur welcomes the fact that the Commission strategy paper ` advocates an outward-looking Union ' . #% Of the 1223 new drugs marketed between 1975 and 1996 , only 13 of those drugs were developed to treat tropical diseases and only 4 of those 13 were the result of the pharmaceutical industry 's research . #% In English we say ` two wrongs do not make a right ' . #% in writing . - I welcome this report by my colleague , Edward Scicluna , who has presented a well-considered view and indeed worked hard to get the resolution down to just one vote . #% It is fortunate that Mr McMillan-Scott decided to travel a day before any votes in this particular part-session , because it is my concern and the concern of many of my colleagues that the inadequacies of the transport arrangements to Strasbourg are having a direct impact on who is here to vote on certain subjects and could sway an issue in the vote in this place . #% I too wish to play tribute to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , also the Commissioner , Mr David Byrne , and - dare I say it in the light of earlier comments - to Magda Aelvoet , the minister . #% Turkey has a pivotal role to play as a gateway between West and East and we should be sending positive and welcoming signals . #% I hope the Council can do the same . #% Finally , we have long argued in this Parliament about the problem of the subsidy on tobacco production in southern Europe and the other issues related to tobacco production . #% After eight years of leadership of my country , the hostility and ignorance about Europe in the UK is shocking and terrible and needs to be corrected . #% In this regard we should not forget that , in addition to its association with the European Union , Ukraine also has a strong partnership with NATO , which has contributed to the sense of security of Ukraine , as well as much-needed military reform . #% Firstly , this report was introduced to facilitate adequate liabilities for seagoing ships , not inland waterways including river and estuary crossings . #% The point is that neither of you have majority support in your own countries . #% As the protocol stands , financial contributions from individual parties will be based on each party ' s share of CO2 emissions . #% I believe that the CFSP threatens freedoms such as open access to information and personal privacy . #% I am still unclear as to what happens from the year 2003 . #% I would ask you to respond specifically to that point in reply to our debate . #% 
Can they not understand that the high unemployment in so many parts of Europe is caused by the very outmoded proposals that they cling on to in economic terms ? #% I urge them to continue to show such responsibility . #% And , as the issue of pay is specifically excluded from the social chapter of the Treaty , what legal basis is the Commission using to interfere in national collective bargaining systems ? #% As a member of the IND/DEM Group , which has Danish and English co-chairmen , I am reminded of the story of King Canute : tired of the flattery of his courtiers who told him he could control anything and everything , he took them to the beach and commanded the sea to turn back . #% Is it possible to have projects which twin , for example , schools in Member States with schools in the accession countries and also to twin local authorities in Member States with local authorities in accession countries , to discuss the implications of enlargement and what it means for the candidate countries ? #% That is not what the role of the Commission should be . #% Could I , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Transport and Tourism , acknowledge the progress that is being made by the Council and in particular by the Committee on Budgets in addressing our concerns . #% It is really important that we now show small businesses that this was not just a piece of paper . #% This means that a product could be banned if another product that is safer or more environmentally benign is proven to be so . #% Ethical standards on donation , confidentiality , freedom of choice and other issues of concern to individual Member States need to be respected and addressed . #% Mr President , the symbol of the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement brings hope to battlefields worldwide . #% I am optimistic that support and understanding will be provided . #% In my view , this amendment from the Greens goes some way to meeting that . #% The budget for research in the United Kingdom has been increased and the meat hygiene service budget also increased by # 39m for additional control . #% Regarding principles governing near coastal voyages , for example , it appeared that the Commission was allowing Member States to avoid internationally agreed training and qualification standards . #% Low taxation , flexible labour markets , less red tape and a determination to tip the balance firmly in favour of the wealth-creators offers the only way out of a relative economic decline . #% Why should this be , you ask ? #% Mr President , 1 May 2004 will finally signify the end of the cold war and seal the reuniting of a continent that we failed to protect from Communist tyranny . #% The World Health Organisation will also issue a report on the subject in the near future . #% That is a crucial issue that will affect the future of an excellent railway assembly plant in Birmingham where there is no future work . #% Mr President , in yesterday 's Minutes it is recorded that I abstained on Amendment No 22 on the Oostlander report . #% We need to take action now across Europe . #% In my constituency there is an organisation called Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre which wants to get a particular chimpanzee called Naree out of Thailand , but the Thai Government has not been helpful in this regard . #% However , if it is going to , then it will have to get its act together very fast . #% The UK was the only country not to have a proportional system and this therefore brings the UK into line with all the other Member States at least in that respect . #% A stable euro will be good for Europe and good for the world . #% A particularly regrettable aspect of this activity is that anti-personnel landmines have reportedly been laid along the border by the Burmese . #% If the NGOs were to pull out , conditions would deteriorate and armed conflict escalate . #% When that is not possible , we will be told why . #% Is the Council aware of some research concerning large European countries published in the in recent days , which shows that the majority of working people in all those countries , with the possible exception of Spain , want more flexibility in their working hours , not less ? #% Mr President , the recent Brok report argued that the EU as a whole should play a major role within the UN . #% I only hope that the President-elect Mr Prodi will take this as an example of how not to do it . #% There must be no more Lockerbies . #% Of course expenditure must meet legal requirements and if a legal base is necessary then it must be found . #% We have already had one question asked in the House concerning a point of controversy that arose only last night and which might well , because of confusion , jeopardise an important amendment . #% We therefore needed a more comprehensive approach and this recommendation may prove to be a useful contribution . #% I particularly condemn the way the Socialist rapporteur has indulged in Old Labour negative knocking of her country , just to score points against her political opponents , and has abused the tradition of this House consensus in the process . #% I would like just briefly to follow up one aspect , which I do not think you really touched on . #% In Europe we are mourning thousands of our own citizens , but with admiration for and gratitude to the local people who , despite their own loss and pain , found the courage and compassion to care for bewildered and frightened foreign tourists . #% I know that the rapporteur has felt pressured to table a compromise saying that Member States should consider abolishing those measures and specifically mentioning the three Member States that did not introduce them in the first place . #% However , rather than being totally negative , we should regard that outcome -- should it occur -- as a fresh opportunity for us all to establish a modern Union that respects and celebrates its diversity and which is accountable by the people and from the people , rather than one which demands too much conformity . #% That is what it was about and what I had hoped to achieve . #% This to me typifies what the Community is about . #% Mr President , often it seems that education plays second fiddle to the issues of market liberalisation , technological innovation and indeed the promotion of telecommunications and entrepreneurial infrastructure . #% Madam President , I am delighted at the victory of Parliament at the Court of First Instance . #% Pakistan should desist from its restrictive positive list of freely traded goods and change to a more liberal negative list as expected by MFN and SAFTA rules . #% The car industry is probably one of the most competitive manufacturing industries of any that we deal with . #% We can not force any Member State to participate . #% Our second concern really relates to the second point the rapporteur made in his opening remarks - the way in which the structural funds are currently managed . #% Five years ago , when the Natura 2000 programme was being prepared , Commissioner Wallström , the then Environment Commissioner , used the fact that structural funds could be withheld unless the Habitats Directive was properly complied with as a means of encouraging the process . #% But she told me that she only took on that risk because she believed Lloyd 's was regulated in accordance with British and European rules . #% Can I have your assurance that you will not give in to such pressure ? #% The United States , as Mrs Maij-Weggen has said , has had the Cohen/Feinstein amendment which says that the United States is prepared to take strong measures in relation to sanctions and , indeed , visa restrictions against Burma . #% This explanation of vote is necessary in order to correct the record . #% Mr President , it is interesting to see that none of our British Conservative colleagues are here today to support their record on liberalisation in such areas as the railways . #% We have had talk on this issue , year in , year out . #% I thank him for that . #% My comments have been misrepresented in the press . #% We have the biggest opportunity ever to make the single market a reality to many sole traders and SMEs in our Member States who may not previously have thought of selling outside their own immediate locality . #% The comments about the accountability of police services make very uncomfortable reading , particularly when we are concerned with the core standards that people should expect across the European Union in , for example , the implementation of the European arrest warrant . #% I have a great interest in this question , both as the Member representing the region of Stoke-on-Trent in the United Kingdom and also as the deputy chairman of the European Parliament ceramics industry forum , which has had a dialogue with both Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Bolkestein . #% What we have here is an attempt , when we see that a particular theory of monetary control is not working and does not accord with reality , to squeeze that reality back into the theory , to the detriment of the innovatory capacity of the Member States and of their financial systems . #% It is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and we know that it is deeply unsustainable . #% You now do everything you can on the world stage and within the EU to acquire all the attributes of statehood . #% Do they really need EU subsidies ? #% I have to say , in disagreement with at least one speaker , that I do not believe this agreement will work without a military presence . #% 
Europe can be the peace intermediary to bring such a peaceful solution to the island of Sri Lanka and peace for the Tamil and Sinhalese communities and others in Sri Lanka . #% In those countries where there is existing effective legislation such as America , Canada and parts of Spain , it is clearly mandated that all three of these elements must be implemented to prevent needle-stick injuries . #% I hope you will join with myself and James Elles and the other members of the all-party Kashmir Group in welcoming the renewed dialogue between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir . #% The European Parliament should use its best endeavours to see that Abacha 's troops are withdrawn and that both humanitarian and military aid are given to enable President Kabbah to re-establish Sierra Leone 's independence . #% I will now go through the amendments we are resubmitting so that colleagues will understand why we are resubmitting them . #% But when we asked whether some of the ACP countries that had specific concerns could be given GSP + as an alternative , we were told this was not possible because they violate certain of the conventions and therefore do not qualify for GSP + . #% Indeed it is so mean , that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market advises that the European Parliament should seek the annulment of this text in the European Court on grounds of a breach of the family rights provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights . #% We should not destabilise the delicate compromise package by seeking to further amend this directive , which already delivers substantial and very real environmental improvements . #% Does the Court intend to produce individual reports for the satellites on which Parliament can give its discharge for 1994 and 1995 ? #% We want to bring that to an end . #% If we really think that , frankly , we need our bumps felt ! #% Pandemics are also included , presumably to make the proposal acceptable to a public that is worried about things such as bird flu . #% Sustainability also requires the use of technical measures as dealt with in the Hudghton report , but these are most effective when they have the full support of those engaged in fishing . #% In the UK , for example , people aged 16 have recently been outnumbered by people aged 60 . #% We should remember that many of the inmates are revolutionaries who will accept nothing short of control of their situation . #% When the telephone was introduced , everybody had the option to go out and use a public telephone in the street somewhere , and that was all that was available until the market became saturated and most people had a telephone in their home . #% Indeed , evidence from the Colombian Commission of Jurists , backed up by the University of Bogota , shows that there has been no reduction in deaths at all . #% More recently , as Syria has pursued a more active engagement with the EU through participating in the Barcelona Process and signing a EuroMed association agreement , all areas of its domestic policy have been subject to intense international scrutiny , in particular its poor human rights track record and alleged holding of political prisoners , with deaths in custody and arbitrary arrests , the preventing of free assembly or of citizens from leaving the country , and , of course , the use of torture . #% Mr President , I am glad to hear that the Spanish Presidency assures us that the Council will play a leadership role at Johannesburg . #% Yes , the price was right , but only the lawyers won . #% I have reports that the comments of these parliamentarians were from the wilder shores of the EPP Group and were notable for their anti-European content . #% Mostar , after all was the city of EU administration , and Mostar shows the strengths and weaknesses of the EU initiatives in former Yugoslavia : the strengths , because there is no doubt that in Mostar we have seen tremendous technical assistance which has helped rebuild it ; the weaknesses , because , of course , Mostar has shown the lack of political will by the Council of Ministers to support some of its rhetoric . #% It is a slur on their reputation to suggest their figures do not give a true picture . #% War criminals must also be brought to book and tried . #% Let us remember too that the vast majority of the civilian population are embroiled as innocent victims in the conflict , including nearly a million internally displaced people who , as my colleague says , have been driven from their homes through fear . #% It is my hope that , with these three amendments adopted and voted upon tomorrow , the Danes can take this forward as an ` A ' point on 20 December and they will be adopted very quickly . #% Coherence , consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures . #% Finally , I would like to congratulate Mr Spencer for including a reference to antipersonnel mines , and to ensure that we all work together to see that they are eliminated from the face of the earth , because they cause so much damage and hurt to people across the world . #% It should be possible to penalise traders who violate their duty of fairness , not least by means of injunctions taken out by consumer organisations . #% As the British Prime Minister said from where the President-in-Office now sits , the Austrian Presidency has been committed to it , but I have to say that the length of time taken , which the chairman , Mr Samland , referred to , was because of indecision by at least one Nordic Member State . #% With that in mind , could I just say that the one problem with this agreement is that it is one institution short . #% We recognise and support ASEAN 's right to choose its own membership , but as the days and months pass it becomes increasingly clear that ASEAN has invited an unwelcome cuckoo into its nest of nations , spoiling its chances of developing modern democracies and respecting human rights whilst encouraging economic development to provide for its people . #% Lastly , I am concerned that there has been mass migration west of ethnic Russians away from the far eastern territories , where Russia is attempting now to forge close links with Japan and Korea on resource exploitation . #% I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Commissioner on his openness with Parliament -- that is a great attribute and very much appreciated by Members -- as well as on his urgency and on the fact that he has not panicked . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr de Lassus on his report . #% As I said , we have achieved a huge amount . #% I would like to say to the Commissioners that it is by no means a coincidence that we are having a debate this afternoon where we are dealing with all of these reports together . #% In view of this serious development and the possibility of creating further instability in the region , will the Council redouble its diplomatic efforts to bring about a settlement in Jammu and Kashmir ? #% We do not say this lightly , but sometimes we get the impression that delaying tactics are put in place by Member States and authorities to allow projects to go past the stage where they might be halted . #% You understand , Commissioner , as others have said , that these are issues of justice and equity and that the concept of the development round would become a sham if the industrialised world is seen as , or perceived to be , reneging on the position that was so satisfactorily agreed at Doha . #% They are separated and have no contact with each other . #% I was glad to hear this view echoed by Mr Barón Crespo earlier . #% Finally , and most importantly , let us not get carried away with our own rhetoric . #% It is conceivable therefore - I can not say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision . #% America bears a vastly disproportionate burden worldwide for securing the liberty of us all . #% I commend the Cotonou Agreement , as mentioned by Commissioner Patten . #% It must also urge strongly against any further provocative testing of ballistic missiles over Japan , as happened a couple of years ago , or moving the sealed spent nuclear fuel rods which are currently sitting in water tanks , which therefore would effectively show that they are very serious in their intent to progress to manufacturing plutonium weapons . #% I understand that serious consideration is already being given to its use in other parts of the European Union . #% The spending of taxpayers ' money in Palestine by the European Union has long been a scandal in that these monies have never been fully accounted for and have almost certainly found their way into terrorist pockets . #% Mr President , I should like to make a brief point on Mr Bernard-Reymond 's comprehensive and excellent report on which we are about to vote . #% The United Kingdom and other countries must sign up to the Council of Europe Convention . #% I have no doubt that other national parliaments of EU Member States hold the same responsibilities . #% Did they agree with that ? #% The EU country defined by Transparency International as being the least corrupt is Finland . #% I quote : ' ? is willing to consider entering appropriations for the extension of the current health insurance scheme to former Members and looks forward to detailed proposals being submitted in due course . ' #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the EU is the world 's largest multilateral donor of development aid and humanitarian assistance . #% I , like other members of the Conservative British Delegation , voted today for a limited extension of the current EU sugar regime in the Daul report . #% This is reflected in the ` no action ' taken over Zimbabwe and China , where there is extensive use of the death penalty , even for such crimes as corruption , pimping , drug offences and tax fraud , its systematic torture of dissidents and its restrictions on freedom of speech , including the Internet , and religious practice , getting off the hook . #% Yet their interests are ignored year after year . #% Obviously , we will be dealing with the four issues that were mentioned by the European Council including one issue which overlaps very much with the Commission 's White Paper on governance . #% This is not a strategic interest to me as a British MEP , because it does not affect the British market in any way - it is much more important for the Danish , the Austrian and the German mortgage market . #% We are dealing with two separate regions of the world in this debate - trans-Caucasia and Central Asia . #% Many Members of this House are getting fed up with these delays and want to know what the answer is . #% The House will be aware that criminal activity thrives on institutional weaknesses and the fragility of efforts to consolidate the rule of law . #% I shall try to illustrate that with an example . #% Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban , Labour ' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same . #% 
Finally , we turn to the question of enforcement and paragraph 6 of the resolution . #% The paradox is that world food production has outpaced population growth : the 5.8 billion in the world today have , on average , 15 % more food per person than the 4 billion 20 years ago . #% It failed to tackle unfair state aids or the lack of transparency of accounts . #% Secondly , I disagree that there is a fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji . #% Secondly , despite the great convergence we have achieved in general , I would like to mention the issue of the two points which , according to Mr Bourlanges , the PPE-DE Group intends to vote against . #% Taken together one might think that these matters already constitute a breach of EU conditions . #% Mr President , I also wish to welcome the President-in-Office . #% Certainly there was one done by the UK which established that the costs far outweighed the benefits and perhaps that is why the EU decided not to do one . #% Mr Barrot , in his contribution , called the whole issue a huge challenge and one , I know , that all our governments are looking at . #% It is proposed that we hold a Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on 21-22 June for the purpose of a hearing with the High Representative . #% My view is his as well . #% We need a European company statute , we want one , the workers want one and the business people of Europe want one . #% We are calling for an immediate , comprehensive and verifiable end to hostilities , respect for human rights , unhindered access throughout the country for humanitarian workers , and for the Government and opposition in Sri Lanka to come forward with a bold gesture of reconciliation , including constitutional revision , as a matter of urgency . #% I was the original rapporteur on Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents and I well remember the heated debates , not only within Parliament but within the Council and within the trialogue , as we set out to win the arguments for what was at that time a groundbreaking regulation . #% As the President has said , we have to meet the challenges from China , India and other parts of the world with fast-growing economies . #% You have come forward with proposals for the reorganisation of OLAF . #% It is not a question of the popping of champagne corks between Brussels and Strasbourg , that is an irrelevance if I might put it politely . #% At last , the United Nations is acting , under Security Council Resolution 1593 , with a referral of those accused of war crimes to the ICC . #% These are the pressing practical matters which must follow from the voting of this resolution . #% Therefore the World Health Organisation , which is already in existence and is doing just such work , should be adequate for this purpose and can protect all of our interests . #% Our view is that there is no room in a stable , prosperous Europe for the type of supranationalism represented by the European Union . #% Whilst I understand the situation , for example , in Austria , where they have gone further , in the interests of the single market we should maintain the legal base . #% May I suggest to the rapporteur that she should look very carefully at compliments coming from the direction of Mr Falconer because they come from a suspect source . #% Did she take money from enemies of the West ? #% They are going to get EUR 1.1 billion at the end of 2013 and it is back-loaded . #% The bigger clubs in England , and I am told by Mr Miller , my colleague from Glasgow , that the same thing applies to Scotland , are sending weakened teams into this competition because they do not see a UEFA place at the end of it . #% We , as a Parliament , have given up our right jointly to decide by interinstitutional agreement with the Council on the financial perspectives and simply , instead , give our assent to those perspectives . #% The Connecticut Yankee was a telephone engineer in America who sustained a blow to his head and was transported back to the time of King Arthur . #% We need to redouble efforts to defeat this menace , not only to protect our shipping , but to send a clear message of our resolve to the agents of al-Qaeda currently enjoying safe haven in Somalia . #% Then we can get in on this act of additionality and take up our fight with the British Government to make sure that we get support from Europe and from the British Government to treat fairly an island which to date has not been fairly treated either by the British Government or by the European Union . #% This morning the First Secretary at the Ethiopian Mission to the EU told me that Ethiopia wanted the situation resolved but needed channels of discussion on the process of implementing the boundary commission decision . #% We do not need to come back to that issue ; we need to ensure that what we decided as a parliament is now applied . #% I have access to western medicine , treatment and care . #% The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has taken heed of the imbalance in the European audio-visual market place , and I hope the Commissioner will be able speak on this . #% The fact that some 30 speakers from many different parties want to contribute to this debate is confirmation of that . #% It has a sign to that effect outside and the two vehicles I referred to have Commission logos on them . #% I do not believe this proposal does that . #% The United States of America reached the EU 's current level of GDP per capita in 1985 . #% We want a global format that will allow people to tag their e-mail messages by sender and by subject . #% Instead , it represents almost a synthesis of those two views , because it shows how and when and why the WTO should , and must , be reformed . #% This is perhaps the area of greatest concern and the focus of the oral question . #% We all know , because many of us in this Parliament travel as often as we do , that certainly ports and airports use the advantages of duty-free to actually reduce the costs of fares and of travelling to passengers . #% It will be done by the USA , probably by Russia and in due course certainly by China . #% Having said that , I think we should always make it perfectly clear that our conflict is with the government of Slovakia , not with the people of Slovakia . #% We rightly have restrictions on freedom of speech covered by the laws of libel and slander . #% It is for this reason that we have abstained on the Rutelli Report . #% Things have got to change . #% Mr President , you still have to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether the Council agrees with this budget . #% Investment now represents only about 18 % of the gross domestic product of Europe . #% We are also seeing significant numbers of working poor , those who have jobs but can not afford to live on their wages . #% We do not have the power , you have the power , Commissioner . #% European Union politicians playing bureaucratic games in Brussels will not help this situation . #% So we all welcome the SLIM initiative , but we must all share the rapporteur 's reservations about how it has worked so far . #% I was somewhat sympathetic to what Mr Dell ` Alba was saying because we have to be careful of criticising everybody else if , at the same time , we are giving the impression that we are ignoring that prudency and just doing what we want to do . #% I am working at present on a report in the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy for integrating environmental policy with energy policy . #% Mr President , I have listened with complete amazement to some of the things that have been said here tonight . #% We have also pushed , and will continue to do so , to ensure the WTO is more transparent and the European Commission more accountable to the European Parliament in the conduct of trade policy . #% It is even predicted that if the current trend continues some countries will be facing costs of up to 20 % of their GDP in the next ten years for their pension liabilities . #% I agree with Mrs Roure : we need to beware of the agreements we negotiate with a country which has such a poor record on human rights . #% I am also worried that once again we may be coming up against the law of unintended consequences . #% We need a framework which will be brought into existence after stage three of monetary union . #% These increasing and more diversified social needs , compounded by budgetary restrictions , have led public authorities to decentralise the provision of services or to reduce the range or level of services they are providing . #% We know that across Europe many people are concerned about the situation in Pakistan and the uncertainty that surrounds President Musharraf at the moment - his future - and we recognise that is linked very much to the future of his country . #% Who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ? #% Mr President , in September I stood here and called on the Commissioner to demonstrate greater foresight in the first post-quota era . #% We should rectify that and we can do so through Amendment No 171 . #% 
But I must record that other groups , led by the PSE Group , guided by my countryman , Stephen Hughes , voted this out . #% Secondly , there is the question of the A-30 subsidy lines - a specific , but very sensitive point for Parliament . #% Another very important point on which my group has tabled an amendment , Amendment No 44 , concerns the speed and the workings of the directive . #% We have made it very clear at the same time that we believe in progress in democracy in Cuba . #% Commissioner , like the questioner I too have received queries from my constituents . #% I hope that we will be able to depend upon the House tomorrow to endorse the Conciliation Committee 's recommendations overwhelmingly . #% It is supposed to ensure that Europol respects the Convention 's provisions on data protection . #% It might be dogged by poverty , but good things have happened ; industrial productivity has gone up by 17 % and inflation is coming down little by little . #% The only way to break this impasse is to vote for the report as a whole , to take the process a step forward . #% In response to what has been a very high-quality debate , I am extremely pleased to be joined by my new colleague , the Budget Commissioner , Michaele Schreyer , whose presence is evidence of close interest in this issue and its financial and budgetary implications . #% But we need to ensure that nobody makes the same mistakes as the United Kingdom . #% As a Member State of the European Union , we no longer control our own borders and under Lisbon , the tidal wave of immigration that we have experienced will become a tsunami . #% We have tabled this amendment in Mr Wynn 's name in order to leave the matter of staffing for the Ombudsman open until the first reading when one will have a clearer view of the overall need concerning staff . #% No other accession country has been treated in this way and Parliament should reject these amendments . #% How was it put into operation ? #% Internal demand in the EU is depressed because of the attack on social protection and jobs . #% Can you imagine the boss of some international criminal organization waiting a year , or writing 26 letters , before he gets a reply from one of his henchmen ? #% They are a plastic , but they are not really designated as one or the other . #% It will serve as a model for other types of brokers in financial products and , not doubt , in other areas as well . #% I realise that I was the only person who applauded in that committee , which put me at odds with many of my colleagues . #% The EU has a responsibility to ensure that developing countries have the capacity to engage in and benefit from the global economy . #% Slovenia should in particular bear in mind that membership of the European Union involves taking on the acquis communautaire in full , with no exceptions beyond temporary derogations . #% Unfortunately , the country deteriorated into authoritarianism and the repression of linguistic and religious rights after the election of Lukashenko as president in 1994 . #% The annexation of sovereign Georgian territory can not be brushed under the carpet , either by Russia or the EU . #% I have agreed with Mrs Flesch that amendments from the committee today have my full support to go through unchallenged , as there are a number of useful contributions there . #% Many of those who are injured , and their families , face an agonising wait to find out whether they have contracted a blood-borne infection such as HIV or hepatitis C . #% In that respect I am pleased to be speaking before Commissioner McCreevy . #% We will therefore continue to fully observe the conciliation agreement which we reached with the staff representatives in March . #% The key to our resolve will be to secure an approval procedure that is transparent , fair and consistent ; a procedure in which the Commission candidates disclose relevant information as to his or her professional capacity to do the job to which he or she will be assigned . #% Although this House was given the power of codecision vis-à-vis such legislation by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 , it was not given the power to oversee effectively the role of any committee . #% Regulation 1408/71 is about coordinating social security , which derives its legal base from Article 42 , which is not concerned with taxation at all . #% As ENP rapporteur I have had to recalibrate and accept that clearly our strategic EU interests have by necessity refocused on our Eastern European and Caucasus neighbours and our Euromed partners , as well as our strategic interests further afield in China and India . #% Therefore maybe the amendment better reflects current reality . #% I also wish to thank the President-in-Office for the very interesting reply he gave us about the Irish experience . #% It is a programme essentially about the modernisation , but also about the renewal and reinforcement of the European social model , and as such it obviously strikes a positive cord with the Socialist Group in this house . #% The MARPOL Convention aims to prevent pollution from ships but legislation is clearly necessary to ensure the convention is enforced . #% I suggest that is too long , and we really must move forward much more quickly than that . #% Access to the grid system at fair prices is crucial . #% One of those is the employment report for 1997 where we bring together all the data , analyse it and discuss questions of policy . #% Only recently , indeed this week , we have had the latest Grant Thornton report which demonstrates the enormous payment periods which still afflict small businesses in the southern states of the European Union . #% It is becoming so easy to make a good living out of crime at the taxpayers ' expense that when we talk about the level playing field , in so many areas of activity involving public subsidies you could say that the level playing field is now crooked . #% It is a cycle that has to end in order to protect fish stocks for fishermen for the longterm future . #% I shy away from the use of the word ` foreigners ' , or indeed the word that was used in the translation of the English text . #% There need be no discrimination , it is not necessary . #% As far as Amendment No 16 is concerned , it can not be accepted at this stage because it goes beyond the aim of Article 7 to which it refers . #% Therefore it is vital for road safety to have a consistent set of rules across the European Union . #% As I understand it , provided that there is a waiver of Titles 3 and 4 of the Helms-Burton Act , the European Union will cooperate in establishing a registry of alleged expropriated properties and will withhold public support from , and discourage investment in , such properties in future by its Member States or its citizens . #% We watch carefully when talk about interdepartmental cooperation in the Commission , on public procurement for example , shows steadfast opposition by DG internal market against awarding public contracts with full reference to companies ' equal employment record . #% Certainly it was meant to be . #% Thousands have died as a result of violence , especially in Kaduna and many Christian homes , churches and businesses have been destroyed . #% Mr President , EURussia relations are not at their most cordial at present , after a serious loss of face for Russia following Ukraine 's Orange Revolution six months ago . #% I approached them yesterday in relation to a ruling on paragraph 89 of the Commission 's legislative proposals . #% One of the things that has rather worried me about the long delay in bringing this particular directive into force has been the harmful effects it might have had on other industries which depend on design : the fashion industry , the textile industry and so on , whose interests at some stage appeared to be subordinated to that of the car industry . #% The EU already legislates , as you outlined in your remarks , but you also implied that this legislation was the basis that could be used . #% It is a restrained request . #% Why have the Commissioner 's predecessors not brought forward proposals before now and why are the proposals now introduced so miserably weak ? #% By sending the protagonists more money : EUR 435 million so far this year to Palestine and EUR 42 million to Lebanon . #% It goes against the whole spirit of economic liberalisation and flexibility that so many of us believe in . #% I do hope that the Council , and indeed the Presidency , will take careful note of these remarks . #% I come from a country with centuries-old , uninterrupted democratic traditions and I want to say two things to the believers in a European super-state . #% It would not be surprising if we were to hear an increasing number of calls for a single European agency that would deal directly with national administrations on the citizens ' behalf . #% Those certainly were the requirements that were imposed by the Joint Parliamentary Committee and agreed unanimously with our Slovak colleagues : that by the end of November , they would establish certain criteria for democracy in that country . #% Concerning the question where , we keep being told about Interlaken and it may be that Interlaken was the place where decisions were taken - high-level decisions taken by lower-placed officials . #% It is not an isolated case . #% For them to take to the streets , as they did at the Labour Party Conference in Blackpool last week , or blockade a port to stop pigmeat being brought into the UK , as they did in Immingham in my constituency a few weeks ago , things have to be desperate indeed . #% In between there has been a weekend and today most people have spent the whole day travelling to Strasbourg . #% 
Again , I would urge the Committee on Petitions to speed up its consideration of this important matter and do all it can to ensure that the petitioners get justice and redress . #% It is obviously right for the House to scrutinise these activities . #% -- Mr President , the situation in Iraq remains precarious , with the deaths yesterday of 47 innocent Iraqis at the hands of a fanatic suicide bomber -- mainly unemployed men seeking work as policemen and willing to try to re-establish law and order in their country and enable free elections to be held next January . #% I welcome the statement by the President-in-Office . #% It can be done and it should be done ! #% I attended the annual gathering of the supreme audit institutions along with the European Court of Auditors in Stockholm , and I am led to believe that there is an acceptance that it was not the intention . #% Both the Council and the Commission have worked very hard to try and achieve some sort of compromise on this instrument . #% The fact is that this budget has to ensure that enlargement is a success and that we treat the applicant countries as equal partners and not as second-class cousins . #% And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made ? #% Mr President , I rise , not in the normal way to contribute to the debate , but because earlier this afternoon the debate on Kosovo was curtailed and there was a certain degree of chaos because we were trying to get the statements from the President-in-Office of the Council and from the Commission , and contributions from Members of the political groups . #% However , we do not agree that one particular view of European identity and culture should be actively promoted through school syllabuses . #% We do not , as a Parliament , reaffirm our endorsement of the resolution . #% Council in this instance requires a 3a committee for all actions above ECU 2m , whereas you join with us in seeking a 1a advisory committee for all actions . #% However , my group will be supporting the argument for a more clearly defined role for the European Union , which goes beyond a couple of officials keeping an eye on development of diseases within our boundaries , or simple supplementation of wider WHO or state networks which may or not be effectively implemented . #% You know as well as I do that , no matter what the colour of your politics in this place , there is one factor that uniquely unites nearly all of us : whether black , blue , yellow , red or green , we all try our best to represent the people who kindly gave us this job . #% Of these , harmonization is more seductive for the gung-ho politician who wants to be seen doing something , one of the scourges of the contemporary world . #% Secondly , on appliances , Parliament 's report welcomes the proposal to put in place minimum energy performance requirements coupled with a dynamic system of energy labelling , to keep up with advances in technology . #% I am sure that those who attend -- and not just the observers -- would wish to have as much notice as possible of the proposals for discussion rather than just find out what they are on the day they arrive . #% And there is one hell of a cost to it . #% The worst thing of all is that this is a regulation , not a directive . #% I support the rapporteur 's view that all substances which have been validly in use in the Member States , according to the laws of those countries , should continue until such time as they can be tested and perhaps found wanting . #% All they want to do is be negative and oppose everything . #% Most of them have no experience of refugee and asylum policy . #% Unless we adopt a clear legislative framework , preferably backed by a Treaty change , we are actively encouraging the Court of Justice to decide what is , or is not , a medical treatment and whether or not it should be reimbursed or require prior authorisation . #% The problem is that everyone wants to make their concessions at the last possible minute - and preferably not at all . #% I am going to remind you about one part , because when you spoke about looking at the letter of amendment and deciding what to do , in accordance with Annex IV of the IIA only the amounts entered in the budget for agreements , which have already been concluded by the Community , can be considered compulsory expenditure . #% Also , will he report to me whether the European Union is doing anything about the large numbers of Burmese people who are being forcibly repatriated into Burma , from Thailand , as a result of the financial crisis ? #% Finally , I would hope the Cardiff summit looks forward to the Bosnian elections . #% We have to make it clear that it is vital for the international community not to allow Mostar , given its symbolism , to get out of control . #% I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his determined effort to put this right , both in his report and the initiative that my colleague has referred to for an energy-intelligent Europe - although I confess that I would describe efficiency and conservation more as common sense than intelligence . #% If the EU wishes to assume competence over education , let it do so honestly , go through the usual channels and employ the transparency we hear so much about . #% Secondly , I would like to ask the Commissioner , given that all of us will be lobbying the Member States to change their minds , whether he can let us in on a secret in the interests of transparency . #% The Council was not prepared to admit that as a part of the report . #% in writing . - Maintaining a strategic approach to energy within the EU is becoming more and more essential as resources become traded as ` futures ' and regimes in other parts of the world continue to divert these scarce resources in their direction only . #% But we will not delegate unless we have the guarantee that we can , if necessary , call things back , in the same way that the Council can . #% Mr President , I voted on the Lucas report in support of measures to lessen the impact on climate change . #% Having said that , we could actually take two courses of action which would help us considerably and would be a sign of good faith to the Council to show that we are serious . #% He has been given an eight-year mandate and he alone will decide any date of any departure . #% I had thought that we should make a giant Advent calendar both for Parliament and the Commission and we could tear off the days as we near the day of liberalization . #% Given that a single blast of this low-frequency technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water and that little is known about their migratory patterns , geographic restrictions are not appropriate . #% Again , I would like to thank all colleagues who have been involved in this long , difficult but , hopefully , very fruitful outcome . #% Turning now to the question of the post-Nice process , I would rather see it as our European future . #% The Council has chosen not to pay the EUR 4 million to South Korea as suspension costs for that programme , which therefore threatens its future . #% Many Liberal Democrats will be challenging the report in the vote tomorrow . #% To use an English cricketing metaphor , it is important to deal with these kinds of issues in a pragmatic way and to ` take it in singles ' , to move one step at a time in order to try to ensure that the way in which we deal with the kind of pollution problems that this directive is supposed to deal with actually works . #% Thus , I can not support the report . #% I well remember our interviewing him for the job and his declaration that EMU would not succeed if it left millions of Europeans without decent jobs in its wake . #% The agenda we voted yesterday says for yesterday evening at 7 p.m. `` urgent committee meetings authorized by the President ' . #% Only a report from an EU institution could say with such a straight face that this is a powerful recipe for success , at least in terms of delivering legislation . #% We have to learn from the mistakes the United States Government made . #% The content will , by the technology at least , be treated indiscriminately . #% If all its various parts , reports , treaties , rules and regulations , etc. are worthwhile and are put into practice by all this team of nations , then the European social model will emerge of its own volition . #% All we have actually seen is a delay of three months from the report by Mr Elles , which was sent back to ommittee in December despite the Socialist wishes . #% It would have been nice , would it not , for the Commissioner to have at least listened to the debate , learned what the outcome of the vote was tomorrow , before she decided to pre-empt the parliamentary procedures and issue this recommendation . #% Yet there is still an attitude around that we are doing such people a favour by allowing them to enter the EU to support our economy and our social security system . #% Madam President , it is customary on these occasions to congratulate the rapporteur . #% If not , on what basis have they been decided ? #% I should also like to make it known that our group opposes the Green Group amendments because they were not submitted in committee . #% By attempting to cut the link between transport and economic growth , we are ignoring clear evidence dating back centuries . #% I am not certain that is really a satisfactory answer . #% I should like to draw attention to Conclusions 9 and 16 of Mr Wyn 's report on the work of the Ombudsman , and to the lack of progress in one particular case . #% There are broadly two categories of amendments . #% In June , he said the rebate would remain . #% I therefore stress that , if we want to have the Commission and Parliament working together , we have to be able to come up with a solution to this problem as soon as possible and not to have limitations on documents which are available to citizens . #% In government I was able to bring in a system of direct payments so that a person was not provided for by social service departments if he or she preferred to have the cash equivalent to purchase the services from the supplier of their choice . #% In conclusion , some of us may have to abstain on this common text . #% 
If you go down to the Sheraton in Kampala , you pay one thousand Ugandan shillings for one single cup of coffee . #% The spotlight is now on compliance , with a provision to find alternative tests , especially in the most difficult areas of toxicity . #% I believe that the work which is being carried out in Edinburgh is not permitted by national law in some other Member States . #% However , the Commission counts on the active support of this Parliament , which I am sure will be forthcoming , in obtaining both the remaining EUR 92 million for 1999 and the additional funding which will be required in the coming years . #% Mr President , although I welcome some of the points in Mr Hughes ' report , especially the simplification of existing Community legislation and better monitoring , I am very unhappy that my amendments on comprehensive impact assessments did not pass in committee . #% Nelson Mandela has been visiting Europe recently and it was that kind of economic pressure that brought the apartheid regime in South Africa to its knees . #% Only by cleaning house and starting afresh on the basis of real respect for the rule of law can we convince our citizens that we are not sacrificing our principles . #% As you are aware , the pharmaceutical companies have taken the South African Government to court about its Medicines Act of 1997 . #% As the EU moves towards enlargement , we must not suggest to countries waiting at the door of the European Union that democracy and the rule of law can simply be overruled , by tacitly encouraging the Irish Government to hold another referendum sometime in the future . #% In concrete terms this means a set of improvements that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and your rapporteurs have identified as falling into four main categories . #% Is it possible for the presidency to examine this question and give us a ruling ? #% Mr President , the earth moved , tragedy struck and our world changed . #% Auctioning will still give windfall profits to some of the major power generators . #% On the issue of the right of privacy : we all have the right of privacy , but that right can not be imposed on individuals . #% However , this directive offends not only against workers ' expectations but also against the dock companies , which have invested heavily in facilities and infrastructure . #% Here they are in the President 's statement and in the letter that Commissioner Bolkestein addressed to the chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . #% We are following the negotiations in Council very closely and we know that pension issues are very important there . #% I think African people should know about the EU 's shabby and dishonourable plans . #% It says that the political situation in the Maldives has remained remarkably stable over the past two decades , providing a conducive environment for development . #% It is strange , is it not , in an age in which personal identity is being jealously guarded and identity theft is regarded as the crime it is , that some people thoughtlessly seek to destroy the unique identity of the institutions which made them what they are , denying others the education they acquired there ? #% Compromise Amendment No 23 on the music and entertainment sectors is a response to such a danger . #% There is something bizarre about Europeans putting in place such requirements when consumers in other parts of the world do not insist on them , when there is no health evidence that supports them , and when we are probably legislating for the technically impossible . #% Mr President , firstly may I write into the proceedings of Parliament today that there was a lot of criticism of my colleagues from the Green Group for dressing up as pirates . #% Happy Christmas , everybody . #% It is not good enough just to have this as a medium-term goal . #% We have to make sure we are ready and have vaccines available . #% Every day brings new massacres like the thirty-three villagers beheaded to which Mr Patijn referred . #% And then when we talk about the compensation for not having a Morocco fisheries agreement , here is where we get into really serious discussion , because again nothing happened . #% The one in ten which succeeds pays for all the rest , but the motto is ` fail fast ' . #% Domestic refrigerators using HFCs are left untouched by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy 's report , despite EU markets already being dominated by hydrocarbon , greenfreeze technology . #% Such assistance and support is available . #% If it thinks it can get a better deal in conciliation , then it has another think coming ! #% Paragraph 20 of the report calls for the creation of a sustainable energy strategy . #% The bureaucratic delays caused by translation difficulties or differences in legal systems should not mean that they are held for indefinite periods before they come to trial . #% For these reasons , taking into account that there is much in the report we can support , the British Conservative delegation abstained . #% Applying these restrictions rigidly to workers in the tourist industry and the agricultural sector , with their extreme seasonal fluctuations , will simply drive people into the black economy . #% Real democratic accountability on taxation therefore requires that decisions about our taxes be taken by the governments that we elect , and not by the European Union . #% The rapporteur has produced an extraordinarily unhelpful explanatory statement , which is really little more than a blow-by-painful-blow account of a paper trail . #% And are we really happy that somebody who will be in charge of our overseas security policy was an activist a few years ago in an outfit like CND ? #% There are some areas where the Union has what could be called an exclusive competence - though that term has been avoided in the resolution . #% It will be impossible to determine whether growth promoters have been fed to the chickens , and so chicken producers in Europe will be at a complete economic disadvantage . #% They are going to be properly informed when they are going to be sent substitute goods . #% Lastly , a question to the Commissioner : will he rule out a mass cull of wild birds , since evidence suggests it is likely to be counter-productive , dispersing infected individuals and making healthy birds more prone to disease due to stress ? #% Whilst many of us here understand that the Commission can not take a formal position on this , it is worth stressing this evening that we feel there is absolutely no logical reason why these two bodies should coexist as is currently the case . #% On our own continent , it was when we realised that poverty , unemployment , dictatorship and war led nowhere that we were able to form the European Union and then move ahead . #% Yet some might think that every time Turkey makes progress in a particular direction , the goalposts for European Union membership are moved . #% Above all , in this whole area of judicial and home affairs there is now an overwhelming need for extensive and rapid progress in harmonisation . #% It is a straightforward blockage of trade , which will not diminish the so-called grey markets but will make them more confused and complex . #% Recognition of that role is implicit in the provision of this finance from the Community budget to assist the work and fund those projects . #% Negotiators must press on to reach a mutually beneficial settlement on EPAs that will help ACP countries develop and support international trade relations . #% Thus the European public do not support the aim of some colleagues in the House to outlaw low-cost budget airlines or force them out of business . #% We would do our citizens a great service if we could move towards harmonising this area as well . #% It is all very well for us to argue as we do for integration into the world economy . #% As a Commonwealth country , we have a very special influence on these countries in Africa . #% I hope it can be added to the voting list today . #% To cite just two examples : in my constituency Frank Whittle invented the jet engine and James Brindley invented the safety gears on bicycles . #% With enlargement soon to come , we should also understand that this is an important benchmark for the applicant states where all kinds of temptations lie in wait for the agricultural sectors in those countries , as Mr Schnellhardt has already said . #% It is going to cost them money . #% We must be clear that we are not going to commit ground troops until there is a political settlement . #% We do not want the Council thinking that we think we have them `` by the Balkans '' so to speak ; we are not trying to squeeze them too hard , though that may be the wrong phrase to use . #% As more and more Union citizens turn to these supplementary pension schemes as a way of guaranteeing adequate income in their retirement , protection of the rights in these schemes becomes more important . #% However , worrying messages continue to come out of Israel . #% In too many areas including , for example , all-inclusive packages and cruise tours , tourism takes out of local economies , but often does not put much back in . #% But trade is not a magic bullet . #% I think the UK Government , which found itself in the eye of the storm , would also apply those words to him and appreciated this . #% Being separated by time and space , by hundreds of kilometres and expensive flights , is painful and distressing for parents and children . #% 
It specifies in paragraph 1 that these matters ought actually to be urgent and relate to an event such that the current part-session is the only part-session of the European Parliament at which a vote can be held in time . #% All the institutions need to work together to make this possible and I hope in particular that the Council will be able to make a declaration signalling its willingness to review Article 202 in 2004 . #% We need , in this debate , to associate the 1998 discharge with that of the framework agreement which we will be voting on tomorrow . #% Can the code of practice help this situation ? #% We have got a growing problem with the working poor within the European Union . #% Of course , Turkey must also ensure it will abide by the Copenhagen criteria with regard to the rights of women and girls . #% Our pollution is a common heritage which we all have . #% This is not a basis for the kind of dynamic and proactive administration that would be required to implement the strategy , capable of responding to a changing policy environment while continuing to monitor and scrutinise the implementation of existing legislation and policy measures . #% The ECR Group believes that the almost comical name dispute with Greece should be resolved sensibly and rapidly . #% The negative aspect of course is that a new currency is open to abuse and to undermining by the expert counterfeiters that we have already heard of . #% Vote yes for a better Turkey , but vote yes , too , for a stronger , more prosperous , more influential , more tolerant and more secure Europe for us all . #% With a roll call vote costing about ECU 1 , 500 , having 50 roll call votes , I reckon has just cost us about ECU 75 , 000 . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , it is not often that I have any good words to say about Gordon Brown , but he did act swiftly , decisively and effectively to deal with the banking crisis in the UK , even though I must point out that it was largely made worse by his disastrous tenure as Minister of Finance/Chancellor of the Exchequer for ten years . #% Approving our legislation tomorrow will do nothing to lift this moratorium or change the situation with regard to the moratorium . #% I hope that Commissioner Gradin - and I am glad to see her here today - will be able to respond positively to the Wemheuer report . #% We have a European employment programme which is based on four pillars . #% That is important because young people are enthusiastic about the European ideal and we do not want to put anything in their way that makes them think that Europe is not welcoming and not moving in the right direction . #% However , I have been invited , lobbied and asked how I am going to deploy the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy 's soldiers , tanks and planes . #% We also believe that the participation of those experiencing social exclusion and working to relieve it is essential in coming to conclusions and solutions . #% Four , we have heard that 75 % of the complaints are declared inadmissible . #% The terror threat is not new , nor does it recur in the same way each time . #% Second , also in relation to quality , I hope you will apply some pressure to the Commission to speed up its preparation and launching of a new strategy on health and safety . #% Speaking for myself , I have never worked less than a 48-hour week and I do not intend to start doing so . #% Surely our constituents would prefer us to save our sympathy for the victims of these crimes and for the families of the victims who are condemned to a life sentence of grief ? #% The `` Erika '' incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe . #% However , it must be time to recognise that we do not have the right formula . #% There are now 16 third country agreements in place . #% I call for support for the amendments which recognize specifically the needs of blind and partially-sighted people , including internal lighting and colour contrasts within buses and , for deaf people , to ensure visual displays for their information needs . #% Within the legislation , the Commission is asked to produce further reports . #% Our cooperative businesses should be seen fair and square as part of the small business sector . #% It is a health and safety issue . #% Finally , the instability of Pakistan and Afghanistan contrasts greatly with the stability and moderation of our democratic ally and partner , India , which deserves the EU 's full backing . #% The fact of the matter is that we have never been able to bring about greater competition in any area , and I include the airlines , without some rich people and some people varied in their approach coming into a market which is being opened up . #% We must face up to the human rights abuses in the EU . #% Meanwhile , to share with colleagues another piece of news about that , I am sure that everyone would be delighted to hear that , in these very first elections in October , women will be entitled to stand for the first time . #% Determining that the sludge from the sewage treatment plants in these large cities had to be incinerated under this directive would place unacceptable costs on slaughterhouses . #% One of these is in Rutland , the smallest county in England , where a virtual Rutnet was set up , bringing together people in rural , isolated communities for purposes of leisure , transport , employment and social life generally . #% We see the ACP gaining in self-confidence and indeed , most recently at our bureau meeting , raising issues about human rights in Europe ; and quite right too . #% Personally , I think a distinction should be made between the digital world and the world of atoms ; in a world of increased processing power , increased storage and increased bandwidth , you see a tendency towards a price of zero and many in the music industry , for example , have failed to react . #% The principles that he sets out - legislative excellence , good management principles , being able to have accuracy and simplicity , and submitting cost-cutting plans - should apply not just to all institutions other than the Commission , but also to the Commission budget itself . #% The fact that present procedures have not led to mistakes is not an argument against improving them , particularly when this is what the Treaty requires . #% The citizens of the European Union clearly feel that Europe has moved away from them in recent years . #% Can I begin by expressing the Commission ' s gratitude for the thorough report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation and for the support given throughout the consultation procedure for the Commission ' s efforts to conclude the Tenth Convention between the Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees in the Near East . #% However , I regret that today 's resolution was a very substantial change from the resolution we passed on 28 March . #% I would therefore respectfully suggest to the Commission that when this directive is fully implemented it reviews the working of this directive and looks at the possibility of extending the directive in the future to such matters as guarantees and distance selling of financial services , so that the very maximum benefit can be obtained for consumers . #% The UK government has asked all UK MEPs from all political parties to vote down all these amendments and to support the common position . #% We do not want the generality of information , we want the specific detail . #% It also clearly identifies the responsibilities of both developed and developing countries . #% I congratulate the ECB , the Commission and the national central banks on their handling of the logistics of this massive undertaking without any upsurge in armed robbery or counterfeiting , although I still question the need for a EUR 500 note which can only facilitate criminality . #% British Conservative MEPs do not believe that mutual recognition is necessary in this field . #% My esteemed colleague , Klaus Hänsch , first raised in this House the date of 2004 as the date for the completion of the first new accession and we must stick to that date . #% What we have to do today is take a rather more limited approach than we took with the first packaging directives of many years ago . #% There are many Member States who have been subject to pressure from Parliament and the Commission when a development proposal is potentially damaging to the environment . #% Quite correctly , the report makes much of the need for improved growth and competitiveness , but you have to read well into it before you come across the notion that social policy can be a productive factor . #% Therefore , UKIP MEPs will not vote on the Rubig report . #% It has an unmatched range of flexible facilities . #% My only reservation concerns the amendment from Mr Liese and others about low-volume cars . #% Part of the programme relates to public health . #% There are so many young people who need and deserve our support . #% We can not take the people 's assent for granted . #% Now on the positive side - and some of you from other countries may not be aware of this - Bangladesh has lately been admitted as a full test cricket playing nation . #% We often hear complaints from the public about the lack of information , that it comes late , it is incomplete , it is difficult to understand . #% We have been told - I think somewhat cynically - that one or two Member States have a lower level of readiness than the four Visegrad countries themselves . #% I wish , therefore , to make it clear to those who would use my stupidity and hubris to attack Europe and its Parliament , that the fault is mine and mine alone . #% We have to show political leadership and a balanced approach , both in looking at the integration of migrants - something that the European Parliament will look at for the first time during this presidency - as well as the management of migration based on our economic needs and the needs of migrants themselves . #% BMW -- the owners of that plant , a German company -- is investing GBP 250 million to make a new car there and we thank BMW for that . #% 
At this last stage Parliament has spoken overwhelmingly with one voice . #% I hope Mr Costa 's work , his report and the conclusions we will reach tomorrow will provide a framework within which we can begin to tackle these problems . #% I offer no comment on the issue they are raising , but I believe Members of this Parliament should be able to come into the Chamber without encountering any form of demonstration outside its doors . #% This Charter and this proposal profoundly misunderstand the nature of human rights and they reflect this House 's obsession with social engineering . #% I say : shame on them ! #% By voting for this report , Members should be aware that they will do nothing to alleviate the stress and emotion suffered by the bereaved who frequently fall victim to the tragic catastrophes of the repatriation of mortal remains . #% I ask this in the spirit of successive resolutions on human rights in Colombia passed by this European Parliament and in support of brave human rights defenders working under the threat of violence and of death . #% We want to see the provision of training for the mentors themselves and an agreement on the minimum period for placements of training . #% One final point : I regret that the PPE-DE Group has tabled an amendment to paragraph 23 aimed at removing a specific reference to the need for the Commission to bring forward a framework on services of general interest . #% You said , to my delight , that you would not just consider it but positively do it . #% If you increase the percentage of shark fins that can be landed , the chances of increasing the number of sharks caught and of finning are greater . #% I say to President Mbeki that quiet diplomacy does not work . #% New jobs , not directly connected to agriculture , need to be created in rural areas if we are not to suffer rural unemployment , depopulation and villages reduced to dormitories for towns and cities , with all the attendant transport and environmental problems that entails . #% It is Ovid , and it translates as ` Stop it at the start ; it is late for medicine to be prepared when disease has grown strong through long delays ' . #% Most of all , we have said that where some other elements have come in , they have to be addressed and recognised , and the way to do this is to do it piecemeal . #% The identities of people in sparsely-populated areas must also be respected . #% We need to have the knowledge of where the foodstocks are , we need to assess where they are and we need to access those foodstuffs when we have identified them . #% I would therefore agree very much with the rapporteur in saying that it would be dangerous to have this coating on peaches , but I do not see the reason why we have to remove it from pineapples where it is a genuine preservative . #% Mr President , all the points I have to make are addressed to the Council and even though there is no-one on the front bench I am sure the hardworking scribes will relay that information back to the Presidency and to all the Council delegations . #% We should not turn this Chamber into a drafting committee that rewrites , paragraph by paragraph , a detailed own-initiative report on a specialist subject by a specialist committee . #% ` Nobody thinks about setting up a commission of inquiry ; the issue is n't even on the agenda . #% A number of Members have tabled questions in good time for this week -- in particular to the Council -- but received rather confusing e-mails to the effect that the questions could not be translated and would be held over until the next part-session . #% I welcome this report as a positive improvement . #% Their bravery deserves our admiration and indeed our support . #% My colleague , Mr Pronk , said a moment ago that he would like everyone to recognise that Member States organise temporary work in different ways . #% I would say , however , that it is not just the Commission that can do things . #% This amendment mentions the recent declaration of the Donors Conference for Colombia held in Cartagena . #% While it subsidies its own industries - especially agriculture through the unreformed common agricultural policy - and it dumps subsidised goods on the world market , all of this destabilises third-world economies . #% Parliament is very fortunate in having distinguished Members who are experts in their field and that is reflected in the quality of the work they presented to us . #% He is right to raise this issue , because once we say yes definitively to Turkey and give it a date , how can we say no to Ukraine , Belarus and other countries which probably have more of their landmass within Europe than Turkey does ? #% Consumers need to know exactly what they are buying , whether it is genuine champagne or Wensleydale cheese or similar , possibly even equally excellent products , but from another region . #% And if this Parliament accepts the common position on this directive it will prove my point . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , I had the pleasure a few weeks ago of meeting some of the UK returning forces from Afghanistan and I heard the same story over and over again that they were ill-equipped . #% Mr President , I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and most especially to the petitioner , Louise McVay , on her initiative and determination in getting this matter to the European Parliament . #% It is a very good means of promoting Europe , of promoting our common culture and history . #% We are told that a 20 % duty on the import price of shoes should not lead to a large increase in the retail price . #% This is what the Amsterdam Summit asked us to do ; to regard unemployment and job creation as a matter of common concern . #% I think that many of us would feel that in the public services there is often more scope to increase productivity and the evidence suggests that through more competition and liberalization those improvements can be quite quickly achieved . #% Chainsaws are vital for managing woodlands . #% There need to be proper standards for asylum seekers , to recognise that they are invariably desperate people seeking desperate measures to escape from the appalling situations in their own countries . #% Hence our reasonable demand that black boxes meeting the latest standards must be fitted to all ferries within five years . #% I know that you , Madam President , have a different view . #% The Council is proposing that the payment appropriations are cut by EUR 433 million for Objective 1 , EUR 95 million for Objective 2 and EUR 33 million for Interreg . #% I stand by your decision , and we should support it . #% We must stop the problem of refugees ` in orbit ' . #% I am also deeply concerned about the snail 's pace at which OLAF worked in investigating this whole sorry matter . #% The Doha round remains the chief mechanism for shaping equitable globalisation . #% The British public is entitled to expect its elected representatives to defend and protect it , not to leave it vulnerable in these vital areas . #% It is time that the EU acts in European airlines ' interests since they are one of the most severely affected industries of the events of 11 September . #% May I just point out to the House that at no stage in the last eighteen months has any Member State made any request through Coreper or otherwise for the reform of the institutions . #% Can I also say to the Commission that they now need to take on board the seriousness of this issue ? #% Has the Commission considered that and will the Commission consider it ? #% The Turkish police and army are not serving the interests of the Turkish Government in their excessive use of force against protestors in Diyarbakir and other towns . #% If the national reform plans submitted by governments are anything like those provided by the United Kingdom Government , then heaven help us . #% This code of conduct establishes some important principles which represent a major leap forward in the EU 's contribution to peace and stability in the world . #% At least the moderate Arab States have now witnessed the catastrophe that can so easily be provoked by organisations such as Hizbollah , and Lebanon has seen the effect of tolerating a State within a State . #% While this methodology , like all methodology , is still evolving there is more than enough knowledge to start implementing now . #% They ensure a more efficient and effective way of disbursing EU taxpayers ' money and enable Parliament , particularly post-Lisbon , to scrutinise spending and strategic policy in a more open and transparent manner . #% Can fundamental rights properly be protected by a court which is already overstretched and frequently arrives at its judgments long after the events which it is judging ? #% Mr President , 2003 is indeed the European Year of People with Disabilities . #% Of course , these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction . #% Mr President , I apologise to Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for having missed her remarks . #% This is a key plank in the opening up of the financial services market . #% So I have accepted that this is as far as we can go for the time being . #% In Thailand there is still a lot of illegal trading in orang-utans , monkeys and leopards . #% Our political message here today must be simply this : yes , we believe in enlargement , we want it to go ahead and we are not going to renege on our historic commitment to the countries of central and eastern Europe . #% 
I sympathise with the Dutch colleagues in their particular situation and , as I said , the oral amendment tabled by Mrs Gillig will go some way towards that . #% We need the ASEAN states to insist on the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and on freedom for the NLD opposition . #% My last point concerns the Korean Energy Development Organisation . #% I welcome the remarks of Mr Oostlander , and I welcome his support for the report . #% However , we can not support the growing trend for harmonisation of criminal law at a European level as this is unnecessary and impractical . #% At the same time , the number of people dependent upon humanitarian assistance has risen to nearly 3 million . #% It is fair enough that this has been set for May , when the new Member States will legally be members and can sign that new Treaty . #% If the proposal is to have the maximum benefit , implementation entails direct and continuous contact by the national Europass centres both with universities and colleges and also with employers ' organisations . #% Perhaps the appeasers in this House could also explain why they embraced a war in Kosovo that involved no weapons of mass destruction or threat to other states without any UN authority and now find it so difficult to take action against an evil , genocidal dictator who has started two wars responsible for the deaths of almost one million people and who has gassed more people in a single day than died in the whole of the Kosovo conflict . #% Mr President , the majority of British Labour Members , myself included , have abstained on the Santini report . #% I believe that is important because Ukraine is tied very closely to the West . #% Only then , I believe , will Syria be able to fully develop its potential as a nation and to offer its people the peace and prosperity which they truly deserve . #% The EU Member States make up 15 of the 21 importing country members of the International Coffee Organisation . #% I hope our proposal for an annual EU list of countries of concern will be considered in that context . #% We must respect also the human rights of disabled people , included in our report for the first time . #% I am quite sure the Commission and the Council are genuine in what they say . #% Many of the new Member States want to make use of the opt-out . #% As politicians , awareness of the danger to our freedoms and our very lives is something we must all strive to remind current and future generations . #% When a kidnapping takes place anywhere in the world , the victim 's friends and family always look to the media to keep the fate of their loved one in the eye of the public and of us as politicians . #% They could be based upon the fact that your representative said in a recent meeting that the EPA negotiations were not about development , but about negotiating new trading arrangements , and that was the mandate . #% I would like to start with the issue of freight and what has been said about it . #% I could give you any number of examples about which I am concerned , but I shall give you just one . #% There certainly is a great deal more work to be done because despite the fact that equal opportunity legislation on men and women in employment has been in force in the European Union for over twenty years , women still earn less than men . #% Women who have worked all their lives to get to a position of responsibility in business - professional women - are being patronised on quotas . #% It is essential that regional and local government are involved in this year but , more importantly , that organisations of disabled people and representing disabled people are involved in this year . #% in writing . - I agree with the recommendations emerging from this resolution , which comes at an urgent time to address the financial crisis . #% Uppermost in our minds , as the former speaker said , is that we have some recourse to justice , but we must certainly ensure that another Equitable Life crisis never happens again . #% Thus is Western Sahara impoverished when it could be helped . #% Mr Khanbhai asked what the woman who had these illnesses would think . #% I think it is a reflection of the political impetus behind the need to complete the single market and to raise its profile which was generated by President Barroso 's decision to ask Mario Monti to look at it , and to ask our committee , under the leadership of Louis Grech , to look at it at the same time . #% Young people - parents - are leaving the rural areas for the towns and their place is being taken by retired people or those who use rural areas as dormitories while their economic activity takes place in the town . #% I am confident that by the end of this week Romania will become a member of Nato . #% The Foreign Affairs Committee also felt it was important to insert a reference to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights , as well as the obligation to respect all existing international law commitments . #% So speaks the United Nations . #% I therefore applaud the Commission and the Commissioner for her commitment to improving the safety of our seas and the Council for its willingness to codecide with Parliament . #% It is certainly clear that this directive needed a rewrite . #% They certainly can not be democratic , because this Parliament is the only democratic element within the European Union and it is almost as good as useless . #% Mrs Klaß has borne them with good humour and we have all learned a great deal and I thank her for her work . #% Here we have to bear in mind as a crucial component in our reasoning that a democratic society has decided that there will be a law that makes the public denial or minimization of the holocaust a crime . #% However , this commercial revolution in the way we do business will also require a revolution in our legal thinking . #% There can not be a better way of muzzling representatives of the public . #% Therefore we are right today to strongly criticise the action which the US Senate has taken on the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty . #% With these considerations in mind we have reviewed the structure of pay and rewards in order to identify and , where necessary , reform the outdated elements . #% I would simply point out that whilst everything has been done to meet the conditions of the Florence agreement , it is absolutely the essence of health and safety that rendered carcases - in the form of meat and bonemeal in which they are stored - should be kept in conditions of absolute security and safety until they can be safely incinerated . #% I think we as MEPs and you as the Commission have missed an opportunity to get the message across about dumping . #% I look forward to working with you in the vote tomorrow . #% All British MEPs should lobby the Minister responsible to ensure that the derogation continues . #% Indeed it seems to me that recent times have seen the transport industry being hit hard by piece after piece of excessive legislation . #% Mr President , political oppression in Zimbabwe casts a long shadow ; it is a cloud that lies over not only those living in Zimbabwe itself but also those who have left to seek asylum in Europe . #% British Conservatives are opposed to any measure which would bolster such a development . #% There was nothing proactive in the agenda you outlined . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the promotion and development of heritage sites in Europe is a necessary and welcome project which deserves our full attention . #% That would be draconian and excessive . #% But , since we do have to include these matters , we have to try and sort them all out . #% If we vote this evening we might get an inconclusive result . #% As far as I am aware that is only illegal in the UK . #% We will not let him drag us back to the barbarity of the Middle Ages . #% I should like to refute that argument and call on all those who are considering this programme to refute it . #% Those are not the words of a political leader but of a political gangster and terrorist . #% Last year 's overhaul of the directive brought all rail workers , non-mobile workers in the other transport sectors , offshore workers and doctors in training under the directive 's scope . #% Such violence can not be seen as an act of love : it is an act of dominance and intimidation . #% We have been looking to the Council for a positive response about the speed of that overall reform . #% If this agreement is to apply equally to all countries , are we going to suspend relations with the US if we think that it is contravening human rights in Guantanámo Bay ? #% Europe 's role was hidden from them . #% This directive is really about formalising the creation of a surveillance society and the control of individuals . #% We need , however , in particular , to encourage technical assistance to achieve institution building , which will allow balanced results . #% 
It is ridiculous even to think the Zimbabwean government could be asked to investigate its own activities . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , this debate in a sense catalyses several years of effort by many Members who are present here , and others , to try and focus attention on the real China . #% I do not accept the implied condemnation of pre-emptive action in today 's dangerous world where weapons of mass destruction may be made available to irrational and fanatical terrorists . #% It is important that such agreements are not just a means by which rich countries exploit one of the few natural resources of an extremely poor country like the Comoros . #% The offer from the IRA , as we have heard , to shoot the killers was an affront to justice and shows breathtaking arrogance . #% It is now politically important , as , in 2004 , it will become a neighbouring country of the European Union . #% I do not accept calls to expel Russia from G8 because of its handling of the Yukos affair . #% I will not repeat what Mr Swoboda said , although I agree with it . #% If there are problems that should be specifically addressed , for example if there are concerns over the poor and vulnerable and disadvantaged , then we should use alternative social measures to assist them and not fall for the short-term fix of cutting tax . #% I should be very grateful if the Commissioner could give us some explanation on this . #% The practices carried out there in the name of Sharia law are beyond the pale of any society that calls itself civilised and humane . #% It is not a condemnation of individuals within that service but it is a hope that we can have a better legal service for the future for Parliament . #% Mr President , I voted for the motion of censure because it was fully in accordance with the manifesto on which I was elected to this House . #% I was also glad to see that paragraph 10 of Mr Van Velzen 's report ` stresses that universal service is an evolving concept which can eventually be expanded ' . #% You have to tell young people in particular the truth . #% I would like to make it perfectly clear that I did not make these comments without having done substantial research . #% Competitive taxation policies , flexible labour markets , less red tape and a determination to tip the balance firmly in favour of the wealth creators offers the only way out of Europe 's relative economic decline . #% He said this it not within the competence of the EU Treaty , but we have British members of the Olympic Council . #% We need to have clearer definitions of what is going on . #% Also , there are many Member States ' national budgets which are running deficits . #% No robust international observer mission has been invited and there are arrests of the few remaining international journalists . #% Any prolonged delay for Bosnia and Albania and the complete exclusion of Kosovo will have very divisive and detrimental consequences , encouraging the search for Croatian , Serbian or , in the case of Kosovars , Macedonian passports , and undermining the integrity and governance of Bosnia and Kosovo in particular . #% Roughly translated that means that non-EU countries can produce their goods cheaper , and this must be stopped at all costs . #% But it is something that all Member States , and all of us , should bear in mind as we move to the Convention to prepare the next Intergovernmental Conference . #% We welcome any others who wish to cross the floor because we would like to have an overall majority in this Parliament , as we have in the Quaestors ! #% For decades , Britain experienced sustained terrorist attacks launched from the Irish mainland . #% Mr President , Mrs Ojala has been very effective in the committee in driving through a very important report . #% The risk to the Community of not tackling substantial structural reforms is too great to be ignored . #% The events of recent weeks have indeed been a wake-up call for politicians across the Union . #% The Scientific Committee on Cosmetics sets guidelines on the sort of tests that should be carried out and these include animal tests . #% According to the statistics , the incidence of a 15-minute delay has risen from 12.7 % in 1991 to 30.3 % in 1999 and is still rising . #% Homelessness particularly affects the young , the old and other vulnerable groups in society . #% The amendments agreed unanimously in committee strengthen the commitment of this Parliament to ensure that European fishing agreements such as the one we are discussing today contain a strong element of development assistance and that this will be reviewed regularly . #% So important is this process that we must not allow ourselves to indulge in other bouts of institutional junkieism or go off onto self-serving ego trips during this debate . #% It is on that basis that we support both reports tonight . #% In my own region , the South-West of England , we have the possibility of constructing a tidal barrage across the Severn that would , with far less potential damage to the environment , have an output of two nuclear power stations and provide in a ` green ' way 5 % of Britain 's energy needs . #% Each country must be judged on its own merit and keep to the criteria , in particular in relation to implementation and administrative capacity . #% Mr President , a bit less fraud here , a bit more fraud there . #% In essence , there is a lot of common ground between what the Council proposes in the common position and the alternative wording that Mrs Peijs has proposed . #% The Conservative Party leads the way in championing respect and rights for women . #% Some people , Mr Barroso , might have learned from reflection to date , saying that perhaps it was not the case , or that they might have done things differently , or even , perish the thought , that they were wrong . #% In these circumstances , therefore , does the Commissioner not agree that football fans will think it is absolutely ludicrous , the EUR 1000 fine - which was about the black-market price for a ticket for England-Argentina - that ticket touts will think that this is good news and that genuine football fans will be disappointed ? #% I look forward to Commissioner Kinnock 's replies . #% I look forward to working closely with him during the course of this year . #% What I want to say to the President-in-Office of the Ecofin Council is yes , have a stability pact but have a stability pact that takes account of economic growth . #% Secondly , I recall that when the previous Ombudsman , Mr Jacob Söderman , asked the Commission to adopt rules on how to treat complainants , his recommendation was to recognise that the complainant was a party to an administrative procedure . #% However , we should now proceed with our programme and not be distracted too much . #% Within a generation we have wiped out a vast proportion of the animals of Africa and now we are doing the same to the seas . #% On this particular application from Novartis for the maize , especially strong objections were raised in Member States and within the European Parliament . #% Similarly , with respect to public procurement , greening public procurement is vitally important but there are currently obstacles in achieving that which should have been acknowledged more explicitly in the Paper , along with strategies to address the problem . #% Mr President , the British Conservatives today reluctantly voted against the Blokland report on the establishment of a Community framework for noise classification of civil subsonic aircraft for the purposes of calculating noise charges . #% At first appearance , this document seems to be an important and very good step in the right direction and I am sure it is going to join the 92/20 revised directive within months as part of the legislative framework to control GMOs . #% What could they bring that might break the deadlock ? #% It is important that we understand the sensitivities and the histories of those countries . #% It made three safety recommendations and the checks were quality assurance checks , as other speakers have said . #% As it stands , the directive creates the possibility that some companies may end up paying for free-riders on the system . #% Therefore , I strongly support the compromise which has been put forward by our rapporteur asking , by first reading , for the Secretary-General to come up with a strategy of how to handle the whole question of languages in Parliament and enlargement . #% The Sakharov Prize awarded to the human rights group Memorial shows just how seriously we in this Parliament view this issue . #% The Council should encourage Member States to make representations to this effect at the United Nations . #% The bomb attack on the Global Television station in Puno last October , the physical assaults against three journalists from the En Persona television programme at Naña on 25 June , the ferocious attack against the political editor of the newspaper Ojo at San Miguel on 1 July , and this week 's removal of Peruvian nationality from Baruch Ivcher , owner of Peru 's TV Channel Two , represent an attack on independent journalism which should be prevented by constitutional safeguards . #% I sincerely hope we can move forward to a sensible and above all balanced approach to Europe 's infrastructure needs , which after all will help determine the future shape of transport across our continent for decades to come . #% In Germany the media have mocked it because of its effect on Bavarian barmaids ' bosoms . #% We would say ` yes ' to delegating technical and implementing legislation , but only if there is an adequate procedure to bring things back if they go wrong . #% Why not pass a resolution supporting the setting up of the Rapid Reaction Force and why not pass a resolution to bring pressure to bear upon Mr Denktash to work towards the integration of Turkish Cypriots into the European Union ? #% Mr President , for me this is not a debate on the rights and wrongs of those in Aceh who campaign for independence , nor is it a criticism of Indonesia 's right to intervene to secure law and order , so long , of course , as that country does not permit human rights abuses to be committed by any of its forces . #% Mr President , I am dismayed at the United States ' belligerency towards the free market in steel , particularly since free trade has been the hallmark of the USA since the 18th century . #% 
The problem is that if you put a lot of extra chicken meat on to the world market -- which is already saturated -- and if you are not careful about using public funds to subsidise it , you may find that meat comes back to the European market . #% I am pleased that the Commissioner has welcomed many of the amendments that were made . #% Mr President , yesterday we had a short debate in this House about a very serious matter : asking the Commission to respond in a debate to allegations concerning its Budgets DG . #% Surely we are not saying here that we should go back to the days of protectionism ? #% Secondly , at the end of what Commissioner Patten was saying , I think he reiterated what he was quoted as saying in `` The Times '' this morning where he said that Member States should back his plans with resources or cut aid . #% EPAs have moved very slowly because of the conflicting ideas on a number of issues including regional integration , identification of sensitive products and preparing concrete and detailed proposals for EPA-related support . #% Can I say that the rapporteur 's sentiments and the sentiments of the committee are summed up in the first paragraph of her report , paragraph 1 , where she calls on the institutions and committees - and I stress the words ` institutions ' and ` committees ' not ` organs ' as Mrs Müller 's amendment seeks - to produce a strategy to enhance efficiency by improving transparency , motivation , mobility and further training . #% The law does not prohibit homosexual acts , only `` habitual debauchery '' , of which there was scant evidence . #% His good faith has been betrayed , as has that of our rapporteur , Mr Poos . #% There are no witnesses , but the taxi driver ends up dead and you go straight to the first police station . #% When hurricane Exxon hits the Florida coast this might well focus attention quite eloquently . #% We quite understand that the public has to have priority - it is their building too . #% Pelinka has a disturbed relationship with Carinthia and his manner of permanently propagating falsehoods is unacceptable . '' #% Syrian leaders need to recognise the importance of the recent shift in international opinion and , in particular , the widespread support for a viable democratic Palestinian state and to work with - not against - the international community for a comprehensive regional settlement , including the return of the Golan Heights . #% Speaking not only for my group but for the majority of the Committee on the Environment , I can say that we did not think that the levels set by Mr Tamino were practical at this stage . #% Therefore , allow me to remind the Council representative , Mr Winkler , of our two specific questions . #% Madam President , should these reports be serious then they certainly deserve a quorum . #% I have worked hard in recent weeks to help computer SMEs resist this directive . #% The proposal will have a positive affect on labour market mobility since workers will be less hindered from going to work in another Member State . #% Our priority is enlargement . #% Secondly , we are right to say that we should not have Technical Assistance Offices performing tasks through temporary officials in what are meant to be permanent posts for the Commission . #% I look forward to what he has to say . #% I should very much like to support what Mr Pirker has just said . #% Rich Americans too have few bucks to spend in Europe because we retain national currencies . #% I am sure they could , and we have heard some examples of what might be proposed . #% I hope so - it certainly did mine . #% Alan Johnson , a UK Trade Minister and representative of the UK Presidency , said just a few weeks ago that developing countries must not be forced to open up their markets . #% The answer to that is : waste , inefficiency and duplication , and that is the issue we have to address . #% Open coordination is one area where we are still getting no clear response as to where Parliament actually fits into the whole process . #% The committee decided to further investigate the issue and a working group on phthalates focusing specifically on toys and childcare articles , composed of prominent academics and researchers , held its first meeting on 8 December 1997 . #% It is becoming more political , more international . #% And , yes , that involves planning and intervention , not just leaving everything to the anarchy of the untrammelled free market . #% This European Parliament is right in our Amendment No 13 to support the holistic approach and for the development of comparable targets , which I will refer to in a moment and which I call on all in this Parliament to support . #% On night work , I again know that some will be disappointed that we did not succeed in limiting night work to eight hours . #% We do not , in those circumstances , need to know who is abstaining when a simple majority is required . #% These are illegal under Decision 87/373 and it would be extremely detrimental to Parliament to agree with this pseudo-legal and possibly illegal practice . #% On the matter of listeria , this crisis came to a head in 1989 when over 200 babies and young children had been killed in preceding years , far more than died of new variant CJD . #% We have been told by certain major agencies , some of the largest operating in the European Union , that they do not oppose a regulation , which is not what the Confederation of British Industry and others would have us believe . #% You are not going to tell us at the end of the Belgian presidency : I am so sorry it slipped ; somebody got it in the way ! #% In particular , its plan to pursue the introduction of kerosene taxes is very important , given the existing imbalance between the treatment of aviation and other modes of transport . #% The arrival of the peacekeeping force has enabled the peacekeeping process to start , but there is still a long way to go . #% For example , I hear a lot about the European migratory system -- the birds that migrate into the European Union . #% I would like to make sure that Amendment No 7 is adopted . #% Red China , however , remains a serious threat to Taiwan , which has been a model of democracy , prosperity and good governance . #% There are legitimate differences over the immediacy of the military threat posed by Iraq , but Saddam Hussein continues to defy the credibility of the UN in its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction . #% I hope they succeed , despite the fiasco of the treatment of Turkey at Luxembourg . #% No one who believes in democracy would accept the post of President of the European Union . #% My own constituent , Shaker Aamer , a legal UK resident whose family of a British wife and four British children live in Battersea in London , is still , after eight years , marooned in legal limbo in Guantánamo . #% The President-in-Office has told us that it is not his business to concern himself with what a Member State does or does not do in terms of ensuring that people who are suspected of dealing in illegal growth drugs are prosecuted . #% If there is no commitment to this scheme from the public authorities it will not happen , because the industry can not justify the research without the commitment of public authorities . #% The Commissioner talked quite rightly about the importance of the peace facility . #% I agree with him that progress on the common foreign and security policy has been disappointing . #% The Habitats Directive of 1992 , which established Natura 2000 , states the EU 's intention to define a common framework for the conservation of wild plants and animals . #% May I offer my congratulations to the co-rapporteurs for an excellent report and also to the Belgian Presidency for having carried the idea , born in Parliament , of preparing the next Intergovernmental Conference by means of a Convention nearly to fruition , although we still have the Laeken Summit to come . #% You just conspire against me , as the previous President did , to engage in some kind of institutional bullying . #% The fact that there are likely to be very few people still doing this is because of the nature of family support of those ill ; proximity here plays the most important part . #% The consequences are too horrific to contemplate . #% What happens if those negotiations fail , as the last ones and the ones before that failed ? #% Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . - Mr President , the Committee on Legal Affairs was very supportive of the Commission 's initiative and of the rapporteur 's stance . #% In that idea he lent his name to a scheme that has channelled the idealism , the energy and the desire to be of use that thousands of young Americans have shown across the world for 30 years . #% Mr President , I first visited Romania for a skiing trip during the Christmas/New Year period in 1989 . #% Madam President , I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has , by an enormous majority , condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider ' s Freedom Party . #% Our Amendment No 3 shows that discrimination against these and other groups is magnified amongst Roma communities . #% Surely , the top and bottom of all this is that the majority of this House wants a sensible , standard remuneration package , salary , pension , reimbursement of expenses where practical on the basis of receipts and vouchers - the same sort of system that most of our voters are subject to in their workplaces . #% Surely this is the ethical approach that we would like to see being copied by other importing companies because this is the way to avoid some of the most unfortunate effects of the anti-dumping measures as we see them before us now . #% Finally , I would like to see the Member States , the Commission and the accession countries really putting pressure on those countries that have not yet ratified the Marpol Annex VI Agreement . #% 
We are talking about a modern-day slave trade , where the women and children have no choice about whether or not they work as prostitutes . #% I welcome this directive because , as the Commissioner said , the current proposals are 20 years old . #% I am grateful for the reply , however negative it would appear to be . #% Our aim must be a realistic timetable to phase out products which have been tested on animals by setting a deadline for each of those tests . #% We were not as successful as I would have wanted on withdrawal and recall , and we shall return to that and other matters later . #% The protection of the human rights of EU citizens who just happen to fit a particular description should not be mutually exclusive from the tracking of the perpetrators and prevention of these terrorist attacks . #% The Honduran Congress has approved a code of conduct and the law authorizing the imprisonment of minors has been annulled . #% These civil servants ought to get on with their own work and leave the political statements to the elected Council of Ministers . #% We have seen the conditions in which many people are kept and while the proposed directive makes clear that detention centres should not be prisons , it is not always clear to us what the difference is between those centres and prisons . #% It opens up a global market place and almost limitless information to anyone with access to a computer screen . #% The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media . #% If that happens , we allow it to happen at our peril . #% The US and the Russians recently set up some hotlines them so they could liaise together over Y2K problems , and in all but one of the seven hotlines they set up , they discovered Y2K problems ! #% In some national parliaments in this instance the person concerned would certainly be called before the parliament , reprimanded and asked to apologise , and we might consider putting that in place . #% Mr President , Commissioner Patten has referred to the dossier that was produced by the United Kingdom Government prior to the debate in the House of Commons . #% That , I am afraid , is discrimination which is unacceptable , and this on a day of history when we remember all those who have fallen in warfare and in a week when we have remembered the horrors of Kristallnacht and the tragic events which followed , and where we have celebrated the achievement of all those who contributed to the fall of Communism , in Poland , where it began , in Hungary , in the Baltic States , in countries throughout Eastern and Central Europe and , of course , ultimately in Berlin . #% What better way to shift the initiative and the campaign away from a mere list of nice intentions towards real action ? #% If that is not the case , then it will be our duty to say so , and I will not hesitate to do just that . #% The European Union has no competence for health services , but it has always had competence for health and safety at work , and then for public health and infectious diseases which have no respect for national borders . #% So here we go again ! #% Our emphasis must be on lifestyle . #% As you know , the European Union has a common position , supported by this House , not to grant visas to members of the Burmese military junta . #% That is far from the reality . #% There is a danger in a democracy that when it has been around for a long time people will take it for granted . #% This is a very serious question . #% Origin marking would be of considerable help there . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to welcome the reports of Mrs Hautala , Hulthén and Pollack all of which make an important contribution to improving air quality and protecting human health in the environment within Europe . #% We have done ours . #% In terms of research and genetic manipulation , many of us would support somatic cell repair but might have doubts about somatic cell enhancement or germ cell repair and certainly there will be grave concerns about germ-cell enhancement . #% There are also concerns that the polling stations set up in the Russian Federation will be very hard to monitor independently . #% By 1 January 2007 , with hard work , consistency , application and our support , she could be here . #% I turn now to the war in Lebanon . #% One of those amendments -- that concerning traditional measuring instrumentation , such as barometers -- would allow the extremely small number of people in the EU who repair , maintain and recycle barometers to continue to operate under very strictly controlled conditions . #% Give us some hope that it will happen . #% That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit . #% At Kyoto , for example , Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott secured , against the odds , an agreement to cut global emissions . #% I am sure that will have the full support of the House . #% The post of High Representative is a product of the Lisbon Treaty . #% They are saying that market access alone is not going to be a panacea enabling them to achieve competitiveness and integration into the global economy . #% I would also like to add my voice to those who deeply regret today the fact that there is no presence from the Council or from the rotating Spanish Presidency , or that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs is not present . #% We all know that in the democracies public opinion is opposed to conflict . #% I hope the Commission notes that . #% I would simply congratulate the rapporteur again and apologise for not being here to hear her speech . #% Mr President , I welcome this opportunity to register my contempt for a decision taken by a high-level group -- which I presume is the Commission -- to overrule the Committee on Budgetary Control and reappoint Mr Franz-Hermann Brüner as Director-General of OLAF . #% Member States should conform with legislation , the Commission should help coordinate it and bring forward best practice . #% I saw for myself the enormous potential of that country -- a potential unrealised at present as a result , among other things , of the US sanctions and the current situation with the European Union . #% However , during the discussion in committee , there was much made of the dangers of the industry . #% I understand the motivation of those wanting individual choice of the applicant to be the determinant of where an asylum claim is processed , rather than the State responsible for entry . #% Why is only Ireland holding a referendum ? #% Trials of the equipment to be used will also be of major importance . #% In fact , even this may not be allocated given that Amendment No 5 to Article 1 ( 3 ) ( new ) , actually says that the amount of money might have to be reduced if it is inconsistent with the financial perspective for the period in question . #% The purpose of this proposal is to protect the environment and human health . #% I drew up on behalf of Parliament a report , which was approved almost unanimously last year , in which Parliament warned the Commission that the reforms must be implemented as quickly as possible to avoid staff demoralisation and public disenchantment . #% These weapons are , in any case , under consideration by the parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons ( CCW ) -- a highly responsible group which is examining matters such as detectability , fuse design and self-destruction in order to minimise collateral effects . #% Apparently the Environment Council was somewhat surprised and even disapproving that we had intruded into their territory and that our intention was to take the environmental inspections recommendation very seriously . #% We need to work together . #% Now we are to make it a fundamental rights agency . #% TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife , in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks , have brought back memories of similar British disasters , such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967 , and have prompted many British volunteers to help . #% I would seriously suggest that he should put himself up again for reselection with his other Commissioners in September . #% We can not ignore , for example , some of these issues which are still left on the table . #% I believe investors should continue if they wish to be able to take their own decisions about their investments . #% There is no idea that is so good that it is not capable of being wrecked by the taxman , so we must order them to get their hands off it right away . #% Mr President , I just want to make it clear that this does not represent the views of the entire ALDE Group . #% Of course you will not . #% So that is very relevant to us in this House too . #% Whilst I vote in favour today , I wonder whether there is an urgent need in future to examine in more detail what appears to be the inability of the EU side of these partnerships to exercise proper financial control . #% 
As has been said by previous speakers , we find ourselves in a position of consensus rather than the normal position of animosity between the institutions . #% The advantage of this is that it will speed up claims considerably and ease language problems . #% We see many severe disparities , especially in relation to occupational pensions and even State pension entitlements , where women are effectively penalised for taking on domestic responsibilities ; for having worked part-time or flexibly . #% European company law can either legislate to harmonise this , or do nothing and let the inevitable process of convergence be driven by the market , providing no particular model is discriminated against . #% My own country has been fascinated by developments in Mediterranean policy for many centuries . #% I am simply pointing out that the Commissioner should not give the impression that there is no room for conciliation on this . #% Mr President , many claim the split over Iraq is between Europe and the USA . #% Secondly , there is the question of the precise timing of accession . #% Mr President , the European Liberal Democrats also reject the European Central Bank 's proposal for a change in the way it takes decisions once the 10 candidate countries join the eurozone . #% Over 100 million EU citizens are already using complementary medicine and its popularity is growing rapidly . #% Its recommendations on the long-term future of reform of agricultural policies , comprising almost half the budget , and in particular the aim to remove subsidies for tobacco production over the next decade , should be strongly supported by this House . #% I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings . #% Mr President , unlike some colleagues , I do not believe that this House should seek a delay in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to temporary agency workers . #% There the text is a little ambiguous : it speaks of equivalence without saying equivalence with whom . #% But I do believe that it is important that we continue to monitor the distribution of funding , to ensure that it delivers value for money . #% They determine the field of competence of the Union , and the powers of the institutions and we ignore the treaties at our peril . #% We have come up with an oral question and a resolution in a spirit of cooperation . #% I welcome the move to step up international cooperation on safety products and to pursue formal agreements with enforcement authorities in third countries . #% Whatever policies we agree for European agriculture from the year 2000 , they must be easy to understand , easy to administer and easy to inspect . #% Mr President , we heard this morning from Parliament 's legal services that if we retained the phase ` including private international law provisions ' in paragraph 15 we could not mention the two articles of the Treaty which are the purpose of this amendment . #% In this context , today really is a landmark in the development of a Community health policy . #% That is why I delivered it as such , so I really do not think I should be subjected to abuse from the other side of the Chamber from that group of rogues . #% After those events we all agreed that the world had changed . #% First , Parliament 's role in the discharge has been shown to be one of extreme importance . #% Anyone would think that the debate that we are going to have on 2 May is the first and only time that Parliament has ever looked at the question of economic and monetary union . #% Speaking as the rapporteur for my own committee - the Legal Affairs Committee - I can say that we were in favour of the Commission 's proposal for a voluntary agreement and felt that the overall package achieved what Mrs Hedkvist Petersen wanted . #% The second item concerns qualified staff as outlined in Paragraph 14 . #% Sadly , in nearby Malaysia the jailing this week of Anwar Ibrahim illustrates how far we still have to go to ensure that the law is used to enshrine and support the concept of human rights . #% I think this is what this directive will achieve . #% However Turkey must be judged on the same basis as any other country . #% But I call on the Commission and other Member States to ensure that their own authorities are as vigilant against this dangerous trade . #% I would certainly not repeat that . #% The President today commented that our aim must be to bring Afghanistan into a modern statehood . #% Certain military leaders are still anxious to end legal action against those responsible for human rights violations and to uphold the rights of victims . #% That means that we will have sustainability in convergence . #% The Commissioner will be entitled to say to us , when we talk about inadequate testing , that the Commission has said time after time that the real truth about BSE was hidden because there was no effective testing . #% Many of us worked as rapporteurs or shadow rapporteurs on the electronic communications package of legislation over two years ago and it is important that we continue to show our political support and sustained engagement . #% At the moment the CFSP is very piecemeal : it owes more to the inspiration of Heath Robinson than to the modern , computer-driven technological age . #% author . - Mr President , as you said , I speak this morning on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on an issue that has been overlooked for so long , namely containers falling from ships at sea . #% The EU must surely be cautious in making no commitment to phase out subsidies for tobacco in the knowledge that all research points to its harmful effects on the health of its users , passive recipients of smoke fumes from others and children whose mothers smoke during pregnancy . #% So , the EU confuses itself , but in the confusion , I should like to repeat one transparent certainty : if the EU is the answer , it must have been a very silly question . #% I think the move towards transparency is something which should be welcomed across the Parliament . #% It should not be about us trying to grab headlines back home . #% As I have already mentioned , this report is an own initiative report of the Committee on Agriculture , and I hope all parties will be able to sign up for this report and make sure positive practical help is given young farmers in the future . #% I wish to stress that this is no reflection upon the work of Mr Miranda and the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% Which Member States come to the Council meeting and ask not what Europe can do for them , but what they can do for Europe ? #% I am happy to report that our plans took a very important step forward just yesterday . #% This is unsatisfactory because we should ourselves be reckoned as protagonists since we will have to adopt the legislation that will flow from Kyoto and we will have to explain it to the people of Europe . #% So this proposal is the best way to achieve price transparency and to ensure a level playing field . #% We must bear in mind that if we reduce the sulphur levels of fuel for ships , we increase the emissions at the oil refinery where these sulphur levels are reduced . #% We can only have a true partnership on migration with third countries if we offer their people adequate alternative opportunities , especially in agriculture . #% If you can call this impartial or if you can acknowledge that this is completely insensitive to the needs of the Caribbean , then I am sure you would wish to do that . #% It has not maintained the fishing stocks or fishermen 's jobs . #% There is increasing evidence - though I agree , for the moment at least , with Commissioner Byrne that it is not conclusive - that there is a link between the presence of these bacteria in pasteurised milk and the incidence of Crohn 's disease . #% A more honest approach - the approach advocated by this Parliament - is to adopt a marketing ban as soon as possible , and then deal with the WTO aspects separately in the unlikely event that our laws are successfully challenged in the WTO . #% The SESAR joint undertaking needs to be reviewed periodically to make sure that the teething troubles experienced by Galileo are not repeated . #% -- Commissioner , firstly let me say it is regrettable that the Commission chose the path of litigation rather than that of negotiation , which would probably have provided a much more practical solution and might have produced a more satisfactory result . #% Transborder European passenger trains will be stifled . #% Four weeks ago I felt strongly that we should have an urgent debate on this very subject . #% Directive 98/58/EC also allows for Community measures to ensure the uniform application of Council of Europe recommendations . #% The bodies of these thousands of brave men are being reburied underneath household and building waste . #% It will not work . #% However I must express my grave concern about the possible misery which would be caused were we to delay . #% To those who say that condom use is not effective in preventing the transmission of the HIV virus , I say they do a great deal of damage and in fact they cost lives . #% Mr President , may I start by thanking the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have undertaken in this very important field . #% I would also ask the Council to bring in a policy to prevent any aircraft landing in EU territory having taken off from Tiraspol military airport , thus ensuring they all fly out of Chisinau , where they can be openly inspected for smuggling , including arms trafficking . #% 
As part of that , we need to ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals , not least in the workplace . #% Only three independent newspapers are carrying any kind of adverts from parties other than Zanu-PF so that only the claims of the government are being read or seen by the people and that has to be a contradiction if we are talking about providing democracy . #% The European Union has responded to the disaster with some EUR 45 million of emergency humanitarian aid in addition to bilateral aid from a number of our Member States . #% This is why the Council should take particular notice of the European Parliament 's report on climate change , which has been expertly drafted by Anders Wijkman . #% We are also concerned about media freedom , the prevalence of organised crime and the massive backlog of court cases . #% The European Arrest Warrant allows any European citizen to be judicially surrendered without a court being allowed to consider the prima facie evidence against them and with almost no power to refuse surrender . #% We must all look forward to the day when , with our support , the voices of the people can be heard equally loudly and equally clearly in the land of their fathers . #% From the common fisheries policy to the Stability and Growth Pact , the whole system is mired in failure . #% Any member or aspiring member of the EU should already have in place systems to protect their citizens based on their own common law , precedent and legislation . #% Partnership of the European nations with the United States requires not just improved capabilities but also political will . #% Clearly that declaration is not balanced : it gives great emphasis to the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier , which it condemns , but spends far fewer words on the completely disproportionate response of the Israeli authorities , which it only ` regrets ' . #% Globalisation has led to a number of issues which touch the sovereignty of Nation States being put on a trade agenda . #% We would like to see full transparency as regards the implementation process as well as concerning the financial aspects to which I have referred . #% However , we still have certain Member States , such as Poland , where the Government has yet to realise what such a commitment means in reality . #% However , we were able to threaten to use our single reading to withhold it - like the famous isoglucose case some years ago - and if we withhold an opinion , nothing further can happen . #% My second question is to ask Mr Kinnock whether he shares my great concern about the lack of interest being shown in his reforms by the Council . #% Whilst young people have not been entirely marginalised in the project of European integration , there has not been enough sustained emphasis on their importance for the future of Europe . #% I urge them , even at this late stage , to vote against these amendments , to vote for jobs , to vote for reform and to vote for Barcelona . #% After all , education properly done is a collaborative adventure and we know we have a lot to learn from each other . #% My second point is in relation to transit . #% I have been asked to write in but I thought it would be worth raising it here as well . #% We never received a clear answer to that in the Committee on Environment and I should like to get one now . #% In other words the Commission , if we object to a draft , will possibly amend it to take account of our objections or refer it to the legislative procedure . #% I appeal to this Parliament to support the compromise proposed by the Industry Committee and not to support restrictive deadlines . #% I , as a British MEP , am proud of the role played by the courageous troops from my country in helping America rid Afghanistan of its oppressive masters and end their harbouring of international terrorists bent on the destruction of western values , including women 's rights . #% That is something that should liven up our debates and is well worthwhile . #% The impact of the campaign is measured by Eurobarometer , which does surveys before and after the campaign . #% The protectionist backlash against the ` Everything but Arms ' proposal demonstrates only too clearly the need to raise the profile of development objectives in our trade , agricultural and other policies . #% The original text of Paragraph 16 states that it is inevitable that `` a significant increase of defence expenditures to fill the current capability gap '' will be needed . #% As a result , European funds will continue to flow into the North-West to help tackle unemployment , social exclusion and environmental pollution . #% As far as the UK is concerned , existing noise regulations have been well thought through and these tighter regulations at EU level are neither necessary nor appropriate . #% Where are the post-Kyoto commitments ? #% He was also right to tighten the Commission 's wording regarding access to detailed ingredient lists for medical staff , ensuring not only access for medical professionals , but also confidentiality of data . #% The great patriotic questions that so obsess some of our Member States , such as a percentage point here or there on their voting weights in the Council , can only be resolved at 4 a.m. on Sunday , 14 December , by the top guys . #% Imagine that with more than 20 Member States . #% Whatever the consequences of these two diseases , the money will have to be found from within Category 1 . #% Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict , of so-called `` water wars '' , in the coming decades , what is the Commission 's view about the potential destabilisation , both in Turkey and in the wider region , that will be caused by this dam ? #% The disease could be carried in the air , in liquids , bodies , articles or by insects . #% Perhaps it wants to join the mass ranks of the parasite nations that already live off the backs of the British and German taxpayers . #% Paragraph 16 calls for the Commission to submit the draft directive on media ownership so that we can be sure we protect press pluralism across Europe . #% A few weeks ago , we adopted Mr Brok 's resolution on how we would like to work with our transatlantic friends , the United States , as we move from a Community of values to a Community of action , so that together we can see how a global system will work . #% I would also echo the comments made about the open method of coordination and the role that the European Parliament should be playing in this , not least in reviewing the national action plans and their outcomes . #% I will be guided by your services , but if memory serves me correctly , there is a rule by which I can request deferral of the final vote until the next voting time . #% The report is a very important one which aims to reduce the amount of bureaucracy surrounding the conduct and application procedure of clinical trials while , at the same time , ensuring that the health , safety and confidentiality of clinical trials subjects are of utmost priority . #% I would say to him that we still do not know where this outbreak originated . #% We would like attention to be paid to this too . #% We have come a long way since the fraud and mismanagement report of the Commission which led to its resignation in 1999 , but there is still much work to do . #% When Pakistan , with India , has had the courage and vision to resume talks which lead the subcontinent from the brink of war , a signal of positive encouragement from Europe is the only just and fitting response . #% I ask for your permission , Mr President . #% Mr President , much as I love Senator Doyle and her Irish friends , she is quite wrong about Sellafield in my constituency . #% There is a double tragedy taking place in Libya at the moment . #% in writing . - One of the positive aspects of the EU is the way in which it seeks to spread values of democracy , human rights and good governance throughout the world by way of its relationships with third countries . #% This industry is never complacent . #% We support the Commission in drawing up a clearer and concise set of development objectives and then produce a resolution that numbers 68 separate paragraphs in response . #% author . - Mr President , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is consistent and united in its view that Eurostat has to be strengthened and we have , for a long time , been in pursuit of establishing higher quality statistical data . #% We had some amusement when six months ago Mr Livingstone went 5000 miles to try to see President Chávez but unfortunately got stranded in Cuba because the President could not find the time to see him . #% Mr President , as speakers have already said , this has been an historic day for the current process of enlargement . #% If Mr Helmer was listening to the debate then he would have heard an answer to that assertion from Mr Blair , because this report nails those lies . #% Such reciprocity between our two parliaments would demonstrate , in a dramatic way , that Turkey is truly advancing upon its European journey . #% We must bear in mind , as has already been said by the rapporteur , that the proposal we are considering is before us at our request , at the request of Parliament , because we wanted to get to grips with money-laundering , with this international crime which represents a substantial threat to the single market . #% Now the governments of the European Union have decided this , and the European Union and this Parliament have supported the measure to abolish driftnets , then they have to do something about the livelihood of the fishermen concerned . #% Here the passage from peace to war would put millions of lives at risk . #% It is a powerful infant industry we are dealing with , in particular when we consider many of the reservations about mobile telephones . #% How , therefore , can it be that Spain could contemplate extraditing another EU national ? #% I hope colleagues will agree that we should be initiators in this regard , perhaps hosting a first meeting . #% The EEA Agreement is a good agreement but it has its limitations . #% 
Similarly , the market does not have adequate resources or adequate ability to ensure that we have sufficiently skilled and trained people . #% I now turn to Paragraphs 6 and 7 in the current text of the report . #% As the House will know , the Commission proposal essentially concerns the setting-up of an agency to implement the Community ' s reconstruction programmes , initially in Kosovo but later , when circumstances allow , in other regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia like Serbia and Montenegro . #% We have not given them legal certainty . #% I have discouraged amendments which loaded other good causes on to our own report . #% So what does this House propose ? #% I turn to the issue that my colleagues have been most tenacious in their support for ( and I am very grateful for that ) : damages in road-traffic accidents . #% I was told by Mr Blair that it would be fine to go ahead as long as it was within the rules . #% Farm subsidies cost those poor countries about USD 50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports . #% That does require regulation . #% I would end by saying that better management of the trade might contribute in no small way to our objective of meeting poverty eradication targets . #% It is worth noting that the NGOs ' Safer World holds up the UK 's annual report , first introduced by the then Foreign Secretary , Robin Cook , as an example for other countries . #% This is where the Commission started out . #% We must also take care to ensure that where co-incineration is proposed , it is used correctly and not abused or used covertly . #% Given the fraud and waste endemic in this budget line , and the way it is not even being used for the purposes its supporters allege , I call on the coalition in the UK to withdraw funding , as we need this money at home - yet another reason to leave the EU . #% It has become somewhat fashionable to attack the European Union project and its institutions . #% It sends the wrong signals but , in reality , it changes too little ; it does not change anything in the reverse direction . #% Bearing in mind that we were asked earlier today to support EU action against the horrendous Mugabe regime , perhaps those who manage Euromed funds might consider that some of this money is going to countries harbouring significant groups who have yet to renounce violence . #% However , while legislative change is essential , I can not re-emphasise too strongly the need for tangible and concrete outcomes . #% This is the new soviet and it is no wonder that Italy now wants Russia to join it . #% Currently , we have inconsistent application of company law within the existing Member States ' statutes on things like publication of information , timely publication of accounts , proper completion of accounts - all those sorts of issues are currently implemented differently . #% The Commission should indeed look at this proposed draft Lithuanian piece of legislation and pronounce whether or not , in its opinion , this piece of legislation is compatible with EU law - although , as Simon Busuttil put it , it is entirely possible that this bill will not become law , as Lithuania is a democracy and is only too well aware of all the issues we are going to raise in this debate tonight . #% The review of communication into a single regulatory framework to be carried out by the Commission next year is to be welcomed . #% Barefoot children lack shoes to climb over the rubble of their former homes , and lives have been destroyed . #% If an oral vaccine can be produced it will be far better for the welfare of the poultry . #% One piece , with the imprint of the PPE-DE Group , featured a male model and was bizarrely headlined ` Vote yes for sexier men ' . #% Firstly , Mr d'Aboville 's report spells out very clearly that we have yet another agreement which has been signed and the payments made before this Parliament discussed it . #% These are the kind of practical measures , economic measures , which will bring the political change that Aung San Suu Kyi wishes to see . #% I wake up every morning , like Mr Bowis , and say to myself ' I am not a scientist ' . #% We in my country , the UK , know him differently as a previous sponsor of terrorism , in particular , the Lockerbie bombing of 1988 . #% Furthermore , it should be recalled that the idea of a transatlantic single market was a British Conservative initiative going back many years and included in more recent reports through my own amendment . #% I conclude by saying that until the refugee issue has found a just and comprehensive solution , the Union ' s support for UNRWA , as a provider of para-governmental services in the West Bank , Gaza , Lebanon , Jordan and Syria , to alleviate the very difficult lives of 3.5 million Palestinian people in the refugee camps , is absolutely crucial . #% Sport has a lot of money and it can not expect to be exempt from free market rules . #% Mr President , I should also like to thank Mr De Rossa for his report . #% They are weapons of dialogue that we use every day of the week in turning post -- Communist states into Member States of the European Union or wider Europe neighbours , away from totalitarianism and tyranny and towards democracy . #% I am glad to say that the Welsh language is now increasingly flourishing alongside the dominant English language , with advantage for people whose first language is either English or Welsh . #% However , we must give the industry time to develop a uniform approach across Europe . #% At the beginning of the 1990s , we were all passionate about enlarging the European Union , particularly in the accession states . #% The report , however , does not examine the markets ' lack of confidence in the euro and the huge capital outflows from Europe over the past year . #% I understand the interest of Parliament and Council as employing institutions in this matter and , as Members of this House will know , I am not unsympathetic to their objectives . #% Mr President , I would like to put on record some of the reasons why I voted for the Poos report on Cyprus . #% So , I can only blame the postal services of Frankfurt and Luxembourg , and I guess they need greater liberalisation . #% It is quite right , as some of you have said ; this is an important area in the world and an important area that we may need to make progress in . #% It is not acceptable that we should have secretaries-general representing politicians in this interinstitutional committee . #% It is an anomaly that we are having to discuss the pressing needs of enlargement at a time when , technically , we can not consider the budget that we know must be used for that purpose post 2004 . #% This proposal does little to help us in our work or indeed to help those innocent people , especially at a time when our efforts should be directed primarily to helping the law enforcement agencies of our various countries , rather than tying their hands behind their backs . #% I would like to express my disappointment and dismay at the PPE ' s vote on the resolution on the World Conference Against Racism . #% Thirdly , this is an electoral process where the EU is playing a central role , as Commissioner Michel has already explained : 80 % of the cost of the election is being met by the European Union , the biggest ever EU electoral observation mission in Africa and all of it backed up by an EU military mission assisting our UN partners in providing the necessary protection to enable the election to take place in peace and stability . #% I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether he believes the resources are there . #% Could you wake up and do something about it ? #% The idea that NATO bombing was justified outside the United Nations because two permanent members of the Security Council would have blocked it is a body blow to the UN and a most dangerous precedent . #% We acknowledge the strong moral and practical support for the coalition from the governments of Spain , Portugal , Denmark , Italy , the Netherlands , Bulgaria and so many other European countries . #% Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union allows any European state the opportunity of joining the Union , which is why accession has already been ruled out for the non-European Mediterranean partners . #% And , fourthly , it showed us that , despite the fact that we spend 70 % of what the Americans spend on defence , we are almost entirely dependent on American equipment because we have something like 10 % of their capacity . #% According to current figures , five of the major car manufacturers are going to reach the voluntary agreement target of 140g of CO2 by 2008 , but 75 % are not on target to reach that . #% Mr President , I would like to reply to the comments that have been made in previous months at this point on the agenda by Members of the GUE/NGL Group criticising the situation in Latvia , and in particular the position of Russian speakers . #% In effect , undertakings are told : you must do more , but no , you can not have the evidence and we will not tell you exactly what we want . #% The question of costs is unclear . #% The theoretical idea of Joint Investigation Teams is not working . #% Policy on radio spectrum may sound like an obscure matter of no interest to the citizen on the street , but the end result of that policy is of fundamental interest because it is a question of jobs and economic growth . #% We can usually judge Russia 's sincerity by its degree of commitment to resolving conflicts like this one , but the fact is that in Transnistria , as well as in Georgia and Ukraine , Russia can not resist interfering . #% Madam Commissioner , what safeguards are in place to prevent the millions of euros of EU aid and reconstruction money from being diverted to Hizbollah through one of its so-called charities ? #% However , I would like to ask the Commission , firstly , its views about the sale of the transmission and distribution division to Arriva . #% Anyone who has worked in research will know that if you get people together you spark new and creative ideas all the time . #% We must keep to the idea of having a short , sharp IGC in autumn 2003 , with the participation of the new Member States , to approve the results of the Convention , which we hope will not need to be changed . #% Briefly , concerning the satellite issue , a fairly minor but an important milestone , the most important thing here is that much of the industry has been against this . #% 
We must have a mechanism of ongoing peer review whereby we have mutual monitoring of the quality of Member States ' justice systems . #% But we have a problem here . #% Thirdly , again according to the press , the Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor , Carlos Castresana , has written asking you to investigate the delay . #% One of the problems we face in the European Union is that during the period of consolidation in preparation for the single currency we have had zero growth in investment across the Union , both in the private and the public sector . #% But even at this eleventh hour there is much to do to ensure that the goalposts are up and not moved , that the pitch is level and fit for play and that the ball is hard enough to score goals for Europe right from the kick-off . #% Much of the debate about free movement tends to neglect the fact that people from current Member States wish to work and establish themselves within the accession countries , and hence our interest in the state of those negotiations . #% Those drastic changes will have huge implications for the 18 sugar protocol countries in particular , as well as for LDCs . #% Mr President , for many years prior to the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990 , development was held back by border wars between the two states and bitter internal struggles which periodically flared into civil war . #% This is not the time to be reducing pressure on the Mugabe regime ; instead , international action must be intensified . #% When such a threat is hanging over the world , to be honest , it puts some of what we have heard in the last quarter of an hour into perspective . #% in writing . - Whilst I recognise that the conflict in Gaza and the West Bank is a humanitarian tragedy , my votes do not support the existence of international influence of the European Institutions as I do not recognise the European Union . #% They assume that business managers do not know how best to organise their businesses and balance customer needs with staff resources . #% We should ensure that these people are not forced to return to their countries if that is going to create desperate problems for them . #% One of the problems with organic food is the difficulty of testing it to see how it has been produced . #% The measures or the methods of calculating damages across the European Union differ vastly . #% The financial and economic crisis made large-scale government intervention in the economy unavoidable - but we must not confuse the palliative with the cure . #% It is an integral component of the single market and is in the interests of all Europe 's citizens . #% He appears to allege parliamentary obstruction to requests for waiver of immunity where no such requests have been made to Parliament . #% This is an actual , specific , individual case , which clearly highlights why this Treaty needs looking at in order to ensure the future safety of Europe 's citizens in the event of nuclear incidents . #% It is much better , rather than going for a supranational environment inspectorate with all the difficulty about right of entry , if we have the legislation in place to make sure that the environmental inspectorates in all the Member States ( a ) exist and ( b ) are performing their tasks to more or less the same standard . #% Since then , the EU has become one of the many actors with a vital strategic interest in the Arctic - its environment and its natural resources . #% A great deal of work has been done locally , both in Scotland and around the North Sea , on conservation measures in general and on cod recovery in particular . #% We are embarking on this because most chemicals are safe and we depend on them , but some must be handled with care , some are so dangerous that we need to find safe alternatives . #% Fundamentally , the problems arise from the extreme poverty which exists in some sectors of the population in Honduras and in other developing countries , including numerous Latin American states . #% If we are actually going to deliver on the Millennium Development Goals we have a huge task . #% We are also keen to establish links with petitions committees in other Member States , with a view to exchanging good ideas and understanding . #% Is there going to be a widening of the area of scrutiny which will take into account products of this sort ? #% I refer on the one hand to the need to improve the Commission 's efficiency in achieving its priority tasks and on the other hand the ambition to create some sort of EU diplomatic service . #% We should bear in mind that many have extremist backgrounds and that we are therefore vulnerable to the implantation and cultivation of Islamic extremists within our own societies , not just from Afghanistan . #% That GBP 125 000 gift was a real steal - a cheap and cynical investment that will literally pay dividends . #% However , it is unhelpful ( in amendment 12 ) to use this resolution to criticise the review of the US security strategy at this stage , whilst the precise plans and intentions for the review remain unclear and as yet unpublished . #% Watch in amazement as they create yet another unwanted institution designed to bury our hard-pressed business community in realms of delightful new paperwork . #% A number of short-term measures can be taken quickly to ease the situation . #% This is the first opportunity we have had to debate this important ruling and I accept that the Commission naturally has an obligation as guardian of the Treaties to consider carefully the implications of the judgment . #% So monetary union , the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal consolidation have given back to Member States a useful policy lever which has been out of the policy box for too long . #% They are a danger to the majority of moderate Pakistani people and to NATO forces stationed in Afghanistan . #% The IFF has already put in place a pilot scheme for immunisation , which is searching for vaccines for malaria and for HIV/AIDS -- the scourge in Africa and many other parts of the world -- for which there is no cure . #% The European Parliament would not like a situation in which it has no say in the onward negotiations but , like last time round with the framework agreement , is left with the bill ! #% I have therefore suggested to colleagues informally tonight a timetable that would meet his requirements and I have circulated that timetable to colleagues so that the groups can discuss it tomorrow morning . #% This scheme for the sale of Community ships , which must be at least five years old , to be reflagged as Latvian vessels , should contribute to the achievement of that balance , provided that there is careful monitoring to ensure that such boats are not subsequently reintegrated into the Community fleets and also that quotas are observed . #% How would you address that problem and the fact that the courts can not take into account the prima facie evidence , or lack of it , against an accused person ? #% It is not surprising that we have to counter so much Euro-scepticism in Britain when senior Members of this Parliament call for the EU to be allowed to interfere in the lives of individuals to such an extent . #% This system requires enhanced 112 , which involves caller location . #% However , we support the report 's direction in terms of increasing the energy crops premium and increasing the maximum guaranteed area for such production so as to encourage the promotion of biofuels . #% We also had concern about the absence in the proposal of any specific reference to funding or financing measures . #% We have this invitation which is headed Exclusive Recital . #% We must ensure that the onerous duties placed on us of travelling extensively , lengthy debates and discussions and busy programmes in our regions and our countries throughout the European Union are reflected in a proper health insurance which is up and running and cost effective . #% I would like to mention a number of complex areas . #% There is issuer choice in the bond markets at the moment and that has contributed to integration of the markets and a building up of specialist regulatory expertise in particular jurisdictions . #% Tonnes of bushmeat are confiscated at Europe 's airports . #% May I suggest that the people who think this network is a really good idea pay for it themselves , instead of squeezing ever more money out of the hard-pressed British taxpayer , who is already being squeezed dry by the greedy and stupid politicians who seem to hold sway over us at every level . #% Mr President , I would like , on behalf of the committee , to move at least one of the oral questions . #% And I think some of the progress made by the United Kingdom in implementing the habitats directive over the past year demonstrates very clearly that it is very often not the fault of the legislation but the lack of political will which is to blame for the failure to deliver the goods we all wish to see . #% I know the Commission is monitoring that closely . #% As Mr Gahler said , Dr Mudawi , a brave defender of human rights in Sudan was once again arrested by the Sudanese Government , by its National Security and Intelligence Agency . #% Indeed , I produced an appendix to my report that listed them and this was passed to the Commissioner 's service . #% I would be very grateful if tonight you would tell us exactly what that formula is so that we can report it back to our constituents . #% Harmonising up , yes , but levelling down , no . #% Another change , of a completely different sort , is to liven up our debates and the way we conduct our speaking time . #% Gaining and keeping customers is what business is all about . #% I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded , but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information , or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission . #% Unless we do that I believe that all these statements that come from summit meetings are increasingly going to make the population in Europe cynical about what Europe is going to try to achieve . #% We strongly believe in social inclusion . #% The Commission has made efforts to improve and to clarify the Convention being considered before the House today in order to make its application more transparent and also to take into account the relevant agreed provisions in the European Community-United Nations global arrangement . #% Every time I have predicted that a country would need a bail-out , you have come back and said , oh no , they do n't , everything is fine . #% It just carries on regardless . #% 
It is not enough to focus so firmly on job protection , trying to keep current jobs alive even when the market has moved on . #% The Cold War was evident , the nuclear stand-off only too real and many European peoples were under the yoke of one-party socialist dictatorships . #% This despicable trade is being unwittingly fostered by a policy agenda governed by man-hating lesbians with no knowledge or understanding of the real world . #% We will find many instances of dead animals being left amongst live animals on journeys taking many days . #% It could well be that after making the evaluation and looking at the political priorities we end up with a figure of 1 % of GNI . #% Burma is poor , under-developed and its population increasingly remote from the socialist military government , which refused , in 1990 , to accept the result of the last free election in that country and placed the victor of those elections , Aung San Suu Kyi , under house arrest . #% It might be sufficient for the President to say who is in favour , who is against . #% Just at the time that our committee was describing these matters , a terrorist bank raid took place in Northern Ireland -- the largest bank raid in the history of that province . #% I welcome the ECB ' s decision to distribute euro coins to consumers and larger banknotes to business beforehand . #% Even with only a temporary exclusion of the self-employed , we felt it was very important that we won a clear and limiting definition of what a self-employed driver actually is , to avoid unscrupulous employers pushing drivers into false forms of independence . #% . Mr President , the issue of sanctions is of some urgency . #% Colleagues , when we had a debate here in Brussels on 27 March 2003 , you were kind enough to give us your support for the amendments we proposed . #% I would just say to you Commissioner that I worked on the 77 Protocol which was very much involved with helping the developing world countries . #% Anyone looking at our Joint Parliamentary Assembly over a number of years , as I certainly have for around 12 years , has seen a very heartening increase in confidence , maturity and , indeed , in engaging on issues related to trade and to political dialogue , to which we attach great importance . #% I mean , as well , all of us here and out there in the rest of the European Union as taxpayers . #% Nothing demonstrates that more clearly than the case of the Caribbean banana farmers , some of the most vulnerable producers in the world , whose access to the EU markets has now been ruled against WTO rules , as a result of which they face a devastation of their livelihoods . #% Stamina is what we need in dealing with this issue . #% Our role in this House is clearly to help shape EU legislation that is appropriate and proportionate . #% As the House may recall , in our reform strategy White Paper in March last year we announced our intention to undertake a reallocation of human resources across departments in order , specifically , to concentrate activities more precisely on core policy objectives and to achieve a better balance between the tasks assigned to the Commission and the resources available to it . #% I am told that , at Cancún , a great cheer went up when there was a resolution to the negotiations . #% Someone pointed out that , after 9 years , Belgium has reached a level of 56 % and Austria , after 14 years , still lies somewhere at around 40 % . #% Would the Commissioner think again , and would she agree to meet me to go through some of these statistics , to see some of the evidence and to put in place a ban on the import of CITES-listed animals into the European Union ? #% Why not pick an easy target , one that does not move about ? #% We must do everything in our power to encourage that search for political solutions . #% Mr President , I begin by endorsing the points that colleagues have already made . #% To use his three day absence on an official trip to Israel at the end of a phone and fax is a cheap alibi for a stab in the back by Mrs Klamt and Mrs Roure . #% Indeed , the overall increase has come down from 6.5 % to around 5.8 % . #% Whilst not perfect , UK legislation seeks to promote the rights of workers and encourages employers to treat employees with due consideration at all times . #% I know a lot of people say it is a defence issue , but I think it is also a human rights issue . #% But sense prevailed and now we have it back . #% One of the options that the Commission needs to look at most earnestly is the proper management of the trade , which would involve extensive and , unfortunately , expensive , surveys of animal populations , control of selective killing and , as far as the export trade is concerned , proper regulation for public health . #% Unless that is done we shall destroy public confidence in us and let down the European public whom I believe have not been well served by Parliament ' s actions in respect of the Prodi Commission . #% But before involving the European Union , Mr President-in-Office , let us put our own house in order . #% We are trying to revive a constitution which is dead in its own terms . #% However , it is not clear whether an aircraft becoming unavailable for technical reasons qualifies as an extraordinary circumstance . #% We also called for greater public awareness , for education campaigns and hotlines to be set up , as already exists in TV broadcasting , so that complaints about illegal or harmful content may be recorded by consumers , particularly by parents . #% Britons will now have the same statutory rights on the Continent as all other EU citizens . #% In the circumstances I am sure that the majority of this House would agree that the vote last night , in an unelected chamber ... #% 80 , 000 people from the Shan states and from the Karenni states have now been forcibly displaced , they have been abused and they feel abandoned by the whole world . #% Fortunately , the vast majority of this House rejected these statements and has given a strong voice to criticism of at least two Member States and to racist acts in others . #% For now , however , I can thoroughly commend the common position in relation to the enforcement of seafarers ' hours at work on board ships using Community ports . #% The area where our democracies have traditionally been weakest has been in attacking the legitimacy of the terrorists and fighting them politically in a systematic and well-targeted manner . #% They certainly can not be economic , because we do not live in a world of huge trade tariffs and certainly there is now a global economy . #% Can I say to both the presidency and the Commission that this is something we need to find a solution to together and quickly . #% Not only is the long-term value of forceable eradication questionable , but eradication driven by conditionality is provoking serious social instability in countries such as Bolivia and Colombia . #% That is a fundamental point and the letters are available if Parliament is interested in seeing them . #% It was quite a problem and , as I say , we had four documents before the committee ever met which would have alerted anybody to the fact that an extension of the system was a mistake . #% We consequently recognise that many partners who have not married have family obligations . #% Parliament should remember that though we must be sensitive to the concerns of small businesses , every dealer who writes to us probably has 100 or 500 or 1000 customers , whose interests we must also consider in this difficult debate . #% There are some here - certainly some from Member States that have very effective traceability and labelling possibilities already - who would like to do the whole thing at once . #% I ask the Commission to issue a diplomatic ` habeus corpus ' challenge to the British Foreign Secretary : restore a good man to his post and the gainers will be the Uzbek people and their leaders , but also the good name of British diplomacy . #% Mrs Sommer is still in the Chamber and I thought it appropriate , even though she is not listening , to respond to what she said . #% It was therefore a question of collateral . #% We have a common interest in peace and stability in the Middle East . #% I congratulate him on his continuing determination on this issue . #% This is something that we have been talking about quite a lot . #% Compensation must be paid to the British beef industry by the French government for the damage it has caused the industry . #% But I have to say , Commissioner - and you will agree - that what happened represented a real victory for developing countries because they were skilled in negotiation , and that position by the US and Switzerland , in particular , was finally rejected . #% The leaders of the four big groups are so blinded by their belief in European integration that they simply can not accept any criticism , particularly when it comes from dreaded eurosceptics like me . #% It would be a case of `` throw it on the furnace '' and putting it out of sight and out of mind which to my mind is a false approach . #% In the context of cross-border provisions , which we want to encourage in order to achieve a better and more vibrant pensions market , public confidence in all regulators and underlying guarantees -- and not just in those of one 's own state -- is very important . #% We were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at Lisbon . #% That is something that we can address at second reading . #% I commend our amendment on this point to the House . #% There is evidence that organised crime has spotted a soft and lucrative target in the illegal traffic of human beings who are often prepared to spend their life savings to gain entry to wealthy western countries in the hope of making a new life for themselves . #% Nigeria is an example where dramatic improvement was possible in fatal childhood diseases once the programme developed a home-to-home strategy and changed the public perception about immunisation . #% 
We have to say to the reluctant Commission that this issue will not go away . #% We have put in proposals from the Verts/ALE Group on biodegradable oils and we have satisfied user groups and the industries by putting forward the 3dB noise allowance . #% I would like to thank colleagues for a very focused and informed debate . #% Last year in Uganda I met a farmer who was selling a kilogram of her coffee beans for 150 Ugandan shillings . #% We have daily reports of rapes , murder , torture , and a lot of people say , `` Oh , this is an exaggeration '' . #% Because society is preoccupied with what it perceives as my sex life . #% We also welcome the recognition of the need for the interviewing and assessment process for asylum applications to take place in the applicant 's own language . #% And , just as the railways were the communications network that drove the Industrial Revolution , so the Internet will drive the new Knowledge Revolution . #% It is prohibition which feeds the cancer of corruption which does so much harm to our society . #% That word ` guaranteed ' is incompatible with the UN High-level Panel 's view that no change in the composition of the Security Council should be regarded as permanent in the future . #% The establishment of the Office of Human Rights was accepted in principle by Commissioner Patten at our debate in May 2002 . #% In my few months here , I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU , nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave . #% In the broad economic guidelines we want specific proposals from the Commission on how we stimulate internal demand within the European Union . #% For these reasons , we have voted against amendments or proposals that would breach the 1.0 % ceiling without , in our view , contributing to the promotion of sustainable growth and jobs in Europe . #% If we are not careful , we might end up with increased mobility of exploitation , which would hardly achieve either the goals of the EU or the legitimate goals of the poorer and poorest countries in the world . #% The Commission plans to seek further discussions with Member States . ' #% I also want to say something about the labour market and the need for labour market flexibility . #% But how much real responsibility will they have ? #% This is not just a technical legal exercise , it is a political one . #% I tabled an addendum in the name of my group this morning to include those items and I hope very much it will receive the support of this House . #% I would urge Parliament to support the Environment Committee 's amendments that we will see in front of us tomorrow . #% There were too many Directorate-Generals involved , too many contracts themselves , and it was delegated control gone mad . #% So what exactly is new in Helsinki ? #% Mr President , we are dealing here with four cases referred to us by the Italian authorities concerning the immunity of Mr Umberto Bossi and whether this House should lift that immunity or not . #% Mr President , I ask you to consider what can be done about this . #% Madam President , I should just like to briefly explain why I supported Amendment No 35 , which could be described as a `` wrecking amendment '' . #% I would like to pay tribute to my colleague , Mr Gargani , who handled the report at first reading - a substantial amount of work was done by Parliament at that stage . #% We must be sure that when the Commission acts , our textile and clothing sector -- much of it being made up of small companies -- is able to invest in new technology and production techniques . #% She firmly supports this report . #% The fact that you have a history of which you are proud , and rightfully so , from 1980 in Solidarność and onwards , where you brought Poland into NATO and then started the negotiations for membership of the European Union , you are someone who can embrace the changes that Europe needs now . #% As Mrs Dührkop , Mr Tomlinson and Mr Wynn have said , we are utilizing EU citizens money ' . #% If that is the case , I would like to so request . #% It certainly affected my decision this summer when I was buying a fridge and a freezer for my home . #% I would therefore urge the Commission to accept our amendment concerning the word ` possibly ' . #% However , there are areas in which Parliament needs to act . #% Without the 1996 discharge there would have been no Wise Men 's report , no Commission resignation and no real urgency for Commission reform . #% However , for three major reasons , Conservatives voted in favour of rejecting the Commission 's proposal on voluntary modulation . #% But as the debate we had earlier this evening shows us , 40 years on from the start of the EU , 15 years after the Single European Act , we can not yet say there is mutual recognition of academic qualifications across Europe #% I do believe this is a very bad directive , not in its intention but in its method . #% We need role models from music and fashion and film to get the message across to young people : not just by saying `` no '' , that does not work , but by telling them the truth . #% My report also draws attention to the failure of the Council either to recognise , to use , or intelligently to consult MEPs during the course of the Conference . #% Mr President , on reviewing the Minutes I note that under Item 7 ` Defence-related industries ' it is stated under Amendment No 1 that Mr Provan , Mr Spencer and Mr Cassidy voted in favour of integrating the WEU into the European Union . #% The thank you is to the President , Mr Priestley and his team , and our Quaestors for the way they have taken up the points we have been raising since the last meeting . #% Because of the failure of Member States to put into place legislation , typically the PCBs and PCTs legislation , we now have the extremely serious problem of a long-term contamination of our food chain by a persistent toxic chemical . #% More and more powers are being concentrated in the hands of the state , at the expense of the individual . #% For the first time it reflects interest in the principles of contraction and convergence and of global equity which this Parliament has voted for regularly . #% We can not accept that amendment simply because of the statutory reality that allowances for officials who have left the service are legally defined as compulsory expenditure . #% We must have a diplomatic solution to this problem . #% We will get rid of the distinction between ` Union ' and ` Community ' , which nobody except lawyers understands , creating a single legal entity . #% Without proper investment , the EU 's sustainable low-carbon investment programme will stall , and that means that hundreds of thousands of jobs which could be created here in the EU , and in regions like my own , the North-East of England , which are already starting to make that transformation to a low-carbon economy , without investment those jobs will go elsewhere to the US and China . #% Humanitarian aid is now moving toward Bo and Kenema as well as towards the capital . #% Crying wolf damages the credibility of the precautionary principle . #% That figure as it stands right now should be EUR 30 million . #% My votes in Parliament on 10 March 2010 reflect my conscience on this subject . #% Whilst the group accepts that these two species are caught on the continental shelf , it is imperative that they are properly regulated . #% Now some countries have put decommissioning schemes into practice ; my own country has not been serious about this and therefore is marked down for a 40 % cut . #% In particular I refer to the work that has been undertaken by the presidency in the fight against unemployment . #% Mr President , Mr Gomes for the Council and Mr Liikanen for the Commission this morning have both made very clear statements . #% As the House will know , the Court of Auditors asked for a number of new staff . #% China ' s entry into the WTO will , arguably , have as far-reaching an effect as anything which will take place in Seattle . #% I increasingly believe that the EU and the US are two political entities divided by a common political and economic system . #% Yes , there are risks involved , but what a prize to win . #% Finally , I should like to emphasise what Mr van den Broek said about corruption . #% It is disappointing that the Council has not signed up . #% In those circumstances , it does not seem too much to ask that the Council and the Commission should respect both our institution and the Court of Justice , and not undermine the rule of law , given that the Court is willing to progress speedily . #% Otherwise public concerns may well drive economic activity across the Atlantic . #% 
It is also wrong and quite false to claim that the EU has kept the peace in Europe for the last 50 years . #% Yet these brokers deliberately travel overseas to ply their trade . #% There is also a question of political acceptability to the citizens of the European Union and to the citizens of the Central and Eastern European countries . #% For six months the Belgian Presidency-in-office have sat here telling us we must integrate more deeply . #% However , the EU maintains close relations with Angola , Ethiopia and Rwanda despite condemning abuses there and without any real pressure or action to follow up those condemnations . #% At the moment it is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a whole series of very different nuts , with what I would guess would be very limited success . #% I would echo much of what Mrs Figueiredo has already said . #% We need to see more improvement throughout Europe before we can say that we have done enough . #% They are measures that still need to be addressed . #% Yes , the legal framework order was reintroduced by the president , giving him powers to dismiss the parliament . #% First , Mr Costa Neves ' report and the Commission 's budget . #% I welcome his letter 's assertion that he considers it of the utmost importance that Parliament is fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community . #% Secondly , it is particularly difficult in the case of the United Kingdom . #% These are only estimates , of course , because the Indonesian authorities are not allowing observers in to monitor the situation . #% That is the lesson to be learnt from today 's failure to find an acceptable common resolution . #% My understanding is -- and this is an issue which has not so far been raised in this debate -- that both Ukraine and Russia are candidate members of the WTO . #% These amendments moved away from the principle and practice of reform of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) . #% The key element of the report is that we need to continue to update NATO , update the new transatlantic agenda to develop a sustained and strengthened transatlantic partnership based on a new confidence pact and concept of mutual recognition in which our respective roles can be clearly defined . #% On the vexed issue of what to do about the EU Constitution , I agree with those who say it is dead in its current format . #% The whole ethos is biased against the employer . #% Therefore , this directive must be generally welcomed . #% The report also pays insufficient attention to the danger of proliferation by terrorists and rogue states , as opposed to retention or replacement of weapons by the existing five NWS . #% It allows the RDA to be taken into account when it is close to the upper safety limit . #% Did the Council agree with that ? #% I mention here Article 47 of the control regulation , at least in its original version . #% The situation in the UK has been transformed to the extent that the proprietors of a small guest house were today forced to pay compensation to a gay couple whom they refused to allow to stay , in breach of the law . #% It is invention and creativity that we are here to support and nothing else . #% There has been much comment on Gordon Brown 's late arrival at the signing ceremony , which some claim as reluctance . #% It has been a pleasure to work with him . #% The MDC is supposed to be in a power-sharing coalition , but in the past few days , MDC Ministers and MPs , as well as human rights activists , have been beaten up and arrested . #% We have also heard that at the moment about EUR 52 million is still being paid out on export subsidies . #% Citizens do not love processes , they love outcomes , and we will be judged by our outcomes . #% Our failure to agree this crucial part of the text would leave disabled people quite literally falling through the crack , a crack for which we would ourselves be responsible . #% It is possible that the first decision was made before any of these notices were given that the system was in chaos . #% At no time did I meet the press officer ; at no time did the press officer run anything for the PPE-DE Group -- not that he was there to support our Group ; he was there for the whole of Parliament . #% I visited North Cyprus recently for the first time and found it enlightening to say the least . #% We should be clear that if the challenge of the 1980s for the European Union was the creation of a single market , and the challenge of the 1990s was the creation of a single currency , the challenge for the opening years of the next millennium will be to enlarge the European Union so as to deepen it and also to create a zone of stability throughout the continent . #% I have mentioned two candidate Commissioners but there was a third who appeared before us , candidate Commissioner Busquin . #% We need reform . #% I greatly regret that what I have heard and read over the past few weeks and months means that , for a number of Commissioners in the proposed new Commission , I can not yet say these things . #% This is grotesque and an affront to this House but , far more importantly , it is an insult to the terrorised and starving people of Zimbabwe , whose lives and livelihoods have been destroyed by the actions of the Mugabe regime . #% In my country the boxes are of black wood , no observers are allowed into the polling stations and our boxes are transported by officials , but with no observers , to a centralised counting point . #% I particularly wanted to congratulate President Prodi on emphasising the issue of governance in the overall planning process . #% Europe needs competitive , but also sustainable , environmentally-friendly agriculture producing the high-quality food our citizens need for a healthy diet , without massive surpluses , without polluting our countryside , and without causing unnecessary animal suffering . #% Specifically you said that the pre-litigation phase could be speeded up . #% The arguments will always return to the exact relationship between stamping out through culling and vaccination - whether to live or die - in a society that both cherishes its FMD-free status , yet has proper moral scruples about the means in extremis employed to return to it . #% So , from one member of a group of one to another member of a group of one , let me say : congratulations . #% What we can say with confidence is that the situation of the people of Iraq will be enormously improved with the removal of Saddam Hussein and his tyrannical regime . #% Just look at the blasé attitude we take on how money is spent in the Committee of the Regions , where we have had two internal auditors report problems to us and our action was , and is , to do nothing . #% Although we support its fundamental objectives , which serve a sound purpose , we are concerned that , as the report stands , the provisions designed to reach this valuable goal do not include sufficient guarantees against potential exploitation by criminal gangs and those seeking to enter the EU illegally . #% I can confirm that 30 members did not have the capacity or the ability to go to Seattle . #% As regards NATO , that means ensuring that we can move NATO on to more global responsibilities . #% Secondly , my concern is that by pursuing extremely controversial issues such as the liberalisation of investment , public procurement and services in a projected transatlantic free trade area , other countries could well perceive that as the EU and US setting the stage for transferring the negotiations over to the global level . #% However , the country is an increasing worry to the EU , having deteriorated into authoritarianism and repression of human and linguistic rights , while opposition political parties are now suffering harassment ahead of the referendum and parliamentary elections on 17 October . #% This is not just about trade , it is about health . #% Progress has been made but it is quite slow . #% I understand he has spoken to other groups in Parliament and gained their support . #% These are the instruments that my committee can use and , if the coordinators agree , I am sure that we will be doing an own-initiative report sometime in 2010 to feed into this discussion that the Commission will have . #% We need to match this vision with reality . #% in writing . - I fully support this new initiative on Alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia . #% I continue to have doubts about the effectiveness of a regulatory committee , particularly one empowered to alter quite important items of the directive such as Froude numbers . #% Once a country decides on the basis of these principles not to export arms , no other country should be allowed to complete that sale themselves and so undermine the principle . #% You mention in your statement a lack of balance in what is being said in the public arena at the moment and I agree with this . #% These deals are causing environmental devastation to less developed countries which , in biological terms , is like setting fire to the Serengeti . #% When these matters are now tested in the national courts and following on a judgment issuing therefrom , it would be my intention to carry out an analysis of the case and the point which you have raised . #% Are we afraid of China 's massive population out-producing Europe ? #% 
If the Commission pursues the line indicated tonight , it is on a collision course with Parliament . #% However , this is not just a crisis of leadership , as he says , but it is also a crisis of legitimacy within the EU institutions . #% A problem has also arisen that various elements of the digital radio spectrum are now being allocated across Europe often quite freely , at no charge at all . #% Migrant female workers are very vulnerable indeed . #% Mr President , I rise on behalf of my group but also on behalf of my colleague Lord Bethell , who takes a particular concern and interest in this matter . #% There seems to be a contradiction here which , in the longer term when we come to enlargement , when we come to a new intergovernmental conference , we are quite clearly going to have to resolve in the context of our budget procedures . #% There is a need to refresh the debate and to talk about not global warming but climate protection , to recognize that the ground of the debate has shifted , that there are people in the insurance industry and the agriculture industry who are already feeling the advanced impact of climate change . #% It provides employees with nothing new , but potential differences in the legal text between this draft directive if it is voted and that one could mean a risk of litigation over takeovers if it is voted through . #% Developing countries should be free - as we are - to choose whether or not they have privatised or public utilities to provide their water services . #% That is still secret . #% While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly , it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode . #% Most people are not , and so to introduce a more formal structure into this process is , in my view , a very desirable development because it should assist those outside the circle of initiates , by providing as it does a series of markers for the cycle of the year 's business . #% From Hungary we have Mr Kovács , who will take on taxation . #% The only way forward is negotiations for a political solution , a referendum and elections . #% I underline my support for the amount of work she has done because I actually disagree with many of the conclusions she has come to . #% Regarding paragraph 1 , calling for effective dialogues with supplier countries , earlier this afternoon I attended a meeting where we heard about the work of the Energy Charter and the importance of putting that framework in place , in particular for our trading and investment relations with Russia as a primary source of oil and gas . #% Having said that , I am delighted that Mr Spencer has been critical of Parliament . #% However , it is regulations that Mrs Herranz García wants , even on pot herbs and parsley ! #% Finally I would like to emphasise that I also attach great importance to the principle of subsidiarity . ' #% We had a great march of the farmers a couple of weeks ago in London . #% It was still not clear from the Commissioner 's answer precisely what legal redress a citizen has if information about that person is placed by mistake on a register with Europol . #% A new model strip cartoon has just been distributed to Members showing how exciting the work of the European Parliament is , with glamorous young male and female characters . #% Economic criteria , like concern for levels of investment , jobs and productivity have been ignored but they were always as important as the five monetarist criteria . #% With the increase in air travel , now is the time to set standards on safety . #% I hope that all the other groups , today , will be able to support the PPE amendment . #% Secondly , we believe that in information policy there is a continuing problem : every time we see Commission proposals come through without the interinstitutional working groups , we as a Parliament have to put them back on the information policy lines . #% Until we see the mining waste directive we can not relent on amendments that we have previously passed in this committee and in this Parliament to ensure that action is taken with regard to those dangerous substances and activities , not necessarily utilising dangerous substances that clearly need regulation . #% Of course , we know that there can be delays , that has happened before . #% So what went wrong after that ? #% How will liberalisation ensure that all people can afford warm homes if they do not have an adequate basic income ? #% Last week I visited the United States and I was astonished at the number of times I had to remind them that aid is no substitute for trade and that we have a very important development commitment here . #% I know many Member States include driver education in their basic education system , but for those that do not , this directive will make it possible for all drivers to receive proper training . #% The BBC is crawling with consultants telling it to turn towards advertising ; telling it to make deals with the very people who are trying to destroy it . #% Yet product placement of these products has been treated differently in this vote today . #% While there is fault on both sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict , I welcome the fact that the EU has a much more balanced position with regard to this conflict than the Bush Administration in the US . #% Mr Spencer 's report , however , is practical and concrete , and that is precisely the basis on which we should address this subject . #% Amendment No 36 gives Member States the possibility to reserve certain contracts for sheltered employment schemes or sheltered workshops where the majority of workers in those schemes or workshops are people with disabilities . #% We were also outraged , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excesses of the former USSR . #% Finally , as winter approaches , Russia can not be permitted once again to use its virtual monopoly of gas supplies to Europe as a diplomatic weapon . #% The Commission argued that the economic benefits would far outweigh the costs involved , but Member States dissented and said that they could not go beyond the targets agreed at the Gothenburg Protocol . #% That is a huge indictment of the largest trading block in the world which prides itself on standing up for those very values . #% The current text must be seen as a good first draft and the famous period of reflection should be exploited to prepare for a renegotiation through a fresh convention with a new mandate . #% There is an enormous lobby within the European Union now because of the health effects of nickel and the possibility that this will be introduced into coins used widely around the European Union . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , my group supports the publication of this Green Paper . #% The priorities for the government are continuity and the preparations for European Union and NATO membership , with acceleration of political and economic reform , concentrating on tax reforms to stimulate the economy , squeezing out corruption , reform of the judiciary , modernisation of the customs service and border security , and legal changes to ensure that Bulgaria has a functioning market economy through amendment of banking laws and improvement in the bankruptcy laws . #% Who called the crowds out to protest ? #% I can not accept those arguments . #% We have been able to tackle the problem of the possibility of maternal transmission by also taking out those animals that might be at risk because of their ancestry . #% However , on first reading , the Parliament highlighted the weak wording which would in effect , in my view and that of the Parliament , allow certain ferries to either carry a sub - standard black box or not carry a black box at all . #% Madam President , firstly I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs , Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder , for the excellent work they have done . #% Moreover , the practical policy prescriptions outlined in this report show that the EU is serious about becoming closer to European citizens and countering the common perception that it is run by an elite bureaucracy . #% As we have heard , the Commission 's proposals aim to simplify and modernise the regulation . #% You must succeed and we wish you well . #% We have now completed the process of reconciliation and we have a text for final approval . #% If we carry on down the current road , it is the path to social and economic disaster . #% Their insecurity in the labour market - and many of them are women - will be reflected again in continuing insecurity in their later years , in the decades ahead , unless something is done to lessen that insecurity . #% Similarly , we can not allow Russia simply to behave as if last summer 's war in Georgia did not happen . #% Secondly , to seek with Parliament a new understanding on the operation of the social dialogue provisions of the social chapter . #% There is supreme irony , Commissioner Mandelson , in your being quoted in the newspapers today as saying that one voice which has not been heard in these negotiations so far is the voice of the poor , when the European Union is itself guilty of ignoring precisely that voice : the voice of African countries and other ACP countries , for example , which have all said they do not want a new benchmarking formula in the services sector . #% It is important that we are clear about this objective . #% But now we must do something about the fishermen . #% That is a matter of extreme concern to me and my British Conservative colleagues . #% We support - and hope to hear a robust view on this from the Commission - the notion that primary products should be included in any product liability directive . #% The people are relishing their freedom . #% This has all too often been a very rushed process which has not allowed those of us involved to collaborate as we would have wished to find the best solutions to certain problems . #% This has been called for from every quarter of this House and I hope that the Commission will in fact respond positively to our appeal today . #% 
President Putin seriously overestimated his ability to impose his chosen candidate on the Ukrainian people , even if it meant rigging the election . #% I have one observation , not a criticism , to make regarding Commissioner Prodi 's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy . #% Therefore , it is appropriate to ask the Commission to look at ways that we can do that , certainly with ACP countries , under the provisions already existing in the Cotonu agreement . #% One of our problems in this Parliament is that not many people will take notice of you , especially on that side of the House . #% If I am correct , I think the point she made was that temporary committees would no longer have the same status as they have had in the past : Parliament would not be able to set up temporary committees . #% We have clearly indicated that we can no longer tolerate the carcinogenic effects in these particular industries where the mass production of wood dust which people breathe in clearly leads to the mutagens which cause unidentified mass illness and sickness within our Community every year for many of our unprotected workers . #% It is a major threat to security , freedom and , more importantly , the economic future of Europe . #% The published details on licence applications that have been denied would give unscrupulous arms manufacturers and dealers knowledge about which goods are wanted by whom -- effectively a rogue traders ' customer list . #% Without the votes of Japan and Canada the Protocol can not enter into force . #% Finally , on the issue of regulation and harmonisation , in spite of amendments and some nice rhetoric to the contrary , there is a risk that we will see a levelling down -- rather than a levelling up -- of hard-won environmental health and consumer standards . #% I have to declare an interest : as a broadcaster and a film producer in my time , I am still in receipt of hard-won royalties of one kind or another from some of these activities . #% Can the Commissioner comment on the current human rights situation in Uzbekistan , and does he think the situation there is suitable enough for the EU to proceed with the ratification of a partnership and cooperation agreement with that country ? #% To conclude , Mr President , the final element of this proposal is the committee procedure for maintaining and enhancing the technical nature of this directive , and I referred to this earlier . #% It is quite exceptional for the timetable of a report like this , which is not an urgent legislative matter , to be so compressed that it is brought to the plenary session just two weeks after being voted in committee . #% Moreover , for many of these countries , this is the first slowdown since the first oil shock in 1973 in which the automatic stabilisers have been able to work fully . #% If we in Parliament support this proposal , it will mean that Parliament is seen to be serious about business and commerce , and it will show the world that Europe means business about business . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs on these monetary reports . #% Currently only 30 % of SMEs are run by women but those businesses , according to the relevant statistics , are the ones most likely to be successful . #% The principle of having a takeover directive has been supported at first and second readings and now , after 12 years , we have a final agreed text . #% It is most strange that at this juncture , on the eve of what I am now convinced will be the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty - and I did my bit in the UK House of Lords last year , by the way - the Commission should put forward this extremely muddled and senseless set of proposals . #% So I can not do my work properly . #% Commercial concerns should not be allowed to dominate this vital area totally . #% Today we voted against EPP amendment 12 for the technical reason that it simply duplicates these political positions , which were already contained in Parliament 's text . #% I really do not want us to go back to the tragedies , particularly of the last three or four weeks , when the entire situation went beyond anything that any humane person would be prepared to listen to and be prepared to watch . #% I welcome in particular today Mr Kyprianou 's nomination as the Commissioner from Cyprus , a Commonwealth country . #% Apart from the other very serious implications , the situation makes a mockery of the idea of the free movement of goods across the European Union . #% Therefore , together with the other institutions , I worked hard to ensure that we had a very effective procedure , first of all for identifying those parts and to ensure that the producers of those parts were involved in that , and to develop the new test standards that would be required for approval . #% Again , this is an amendment to ensure that capital is adequate for over-the-counter trading . #% This report is important as a proposal because it would allow researchers a year to publish before the need to file for a patent . #% Those are the amendments that the Budgetary Control Committee has submitted . #% `` We have to resolve the Irish question . '' #% At a time when fish stocks are in decline and when some people on this planet do not have enough to eat , it is shameful that we catch good fish , kill it and then throw it back into the sea to feed the gulls and the crabs . #% Let us hope that Mr Karadžić and Mr Mladić will be found while they are there . #% The case of Dr Ibrahim is deeply worrying because it is part of a trend that we see increasing in Egypt . #% In Community waters during the last ten years over a thousand lives have been lost in the fishing industry . #% Does the Council feel that she and other international celebrities have a role to play in perpetuating the serious publicity that could be given to this highly important issue ? #% I would urge in the coming months that we look at the provisions on privileged partnerships under the Constitutional Treaty . #% I spent a lot of time in the British Army and I am a member of the United Kingdom 's Armed Forces Committee . #% I would ask the Commission today to tell us of its strong support for proposals which are imminent on combating tobacco consumption . #% It is the G8 industrialised countries that make decisions , often led by their own self-serving agenda . #% The committee was also struck by the fact that other central banks have moved more rapidly in recent years towards greater openness . #% Similarly , Member States are not blameless in this funding fiasco . #% However , it is worth reflecting on the fact that within weeks we will have the first commercial third generation services in a major country . #% Hopefully these agreements will soon be matched by marked decreases in harm to pedestrians . #% I congratulate Mr Fontana on the clarity of his report and also on the commitment he has shown , as Chairman of the Petitions Committee , to the needs of European citizens . #% If passengers are not even given any information about compensation , what can they do ? #% We must be serious when we say we must find a way of solving that . #% Thirdly , if a measure was blocked and referred back to the legislative authority , it was referred to Council alone , not Parliament and Council jointly , even though they jointly constitute the legislative authority . #% There will be far fewer bubbles in the rivers of Europe than Europeans have in their baths . #% Run by a vain and maverick dictator , Kim Jong-il , whose disastrous Stalinist economic policies have brought the country to its knees , the DPRK is now resorting to nuclear blackmail and dangerous brinkmanship with the world community , in breach of the 1994 framework agreement and other previous binding international agreements . #% It is complicated ; it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from . #% Mr President , I thank Commissioner Frattini for his presentation . #% Secondly , on enlargement , could he confirm that there is still the political will in the Council so that candidate countries , this House and the public of Europe can expect to hear target dates announced for the first wave of accession ? #% I hope that in future we can again focus on producing good , serious health and safety legislation and not on producing tabloid headlines . #% It is premature to consider any wholesale lifting of the arms embargo . #% It is certainly true that Member States need to make progress to establish more effective national control programmes and at the same time , we need to ensure that imported products meet our own high standards . #% Both sides have to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian law - and be seen to adhere to them . #% It is always good to hear that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is receiving much-needed extra funding considering the new work -- with the committees in particular -- that we are engaged in . #% However , we need to look at the problem without raising undue concerns which would worry the workers in this industry and make the insurance industry very cagey indeed . #% This is a contribution to the debate on research policy in Framework Six Programme and our vote today will enable that to move at exactly the right time into the ongoing strategic discussion process . #% You did not respect the last vote , did you ? #% It would acknowledge that for the three tests for which there are as yet no alternatives there would be a maximum of ten years in which to find alternatives , after which those tests would stop too . #% I congratulate her and the Committee on Legal Affairs for its excellence and thank them for incorporating so much of both the spirit and letter of our opinion into it . #% We believe that issues of crimes against international humanitarian law should not be dealt with by the International Criminal Court but should be dealt with by UN ad hoc Tribunals . #% If you make the claims , you must expect to see them tested , but they should be tested fairly , simply and in a cost-effective way to leave a regime of light-touch and user-friendly practices . #% I am sure the rapporteur understands this , but I do apologise to the House for the original typing error . #% 
Morocco 's intransigence continues to deny justice to the people of Western Sahara , who have been waiting for a referendum on independence for the past 20 years . #% We need to do everything we possibly can to catch up in the areas of , for example , extradition , cross-border crime , judicial and court cooperation , including civil matters as the German minister outlined , and legislation regarding nationality and citizenship . #% So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House . #% I have in front of me the Council priorities , although for the first time in history no one is here to represent the Council . #% Has the Commission thought about this ? #% Whether in the EURO zone or not , I maintain that every citizen within the European Union has much to gain from a stable currency and a currency that can withstand the threats from the counterfeiters . #% It is a great county with great people . #% Has the Commission no powers to do anything more than request or remind ? #% Mr Andersson is right , employers must have the responsibility for preventing harassment in the workplace , not colluding with it , or practising it . #% It is imperative that the mechanism is based on technical realities and is robust , credible and lasting - to which I would also add affordable . #% African countries do not impose conditionality on themselves , nor do the Latin-Americans . #% We do not know how the next few days are going to turn out . #% The recommendation is a very useful contribution in that respect . #% Can I humbly suggest that you circulate this more widely throughout your department , because in the recent Microsoft case and in others before that -- in the General Electric case , in the Tetra Laval case and in the TV premiership football case -- access to information and files you are keeping has been one of the Commission 's weaknesses . #% I regard this as a great puzzle . #% Madam President , I am responsible in the Committee on International Trade for the proposed revision of the human rights clauses in partnership and trade agreements . #% There has been some dispute as to whether countries have been apply them to transit products , thereby adding value to these . #% I do not believe , however , that the Commission , or indeed other institutions , should have to rely on individual motivation by officials or by Commissioners and on rather ad hoc means of applying principles , which are , to say the least , rather generalised . #% The Tunisian Human Rights League , the oldest human rights body in Tunisia , claimed police harassment of its activists and says that it has been prevented from functioning properly . #% For too long in Europe , the laws of the sea were more appropriate to the 19th than the 21st century . #% It was they who were able to call a halt . #% Other than yourself there appears to be scarcely a single member of the European People 's Party in the Chamber . #% Madam President , I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group . #% Because in some Member States that is not yet a requirement . #% Amazingly - and it is a reflection of how superficial is the view and understanding of so many commentators - this is seen and presented as subsidiarity and decentralisation . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , as we have heard from Mr Albertini and the Commissioner , this is a very timely and important report and we welcome it . #% Mr President , on behalf of the British Conservatives and the rest of the PPE-DE Group I would like to say that we strongly support the compromise set out in the von Wogau report and reiterated by Mr Prodi this morning . #% What measures is the Commission taking to ensure that the banks are not applying anti-competitive prices as a way of keeping their bank charges so high ? #% Change , in line with the thrust of the report 's conclusions and catalysed by the Laeken Convention as the rapporteur himself pointed out , is needed to start to remedy these democratic deficiencies in the European political system which , if left unattended , could be so damaging . #% We are told that the programme will cost EUR 671 million . #% Last in , first out ; that is what happens to girls . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I would first of all like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts on what is actually quite a technical report . #% In its recent communication ` Towards a Maritime Strategy ' , the Commission indicated that there is a worldwide shortage of qualified and able seafarers . #% Aircraft should fulfil ambitious but feasible emission reduction targets . #% If we are waiting to find out what the latest situation is , why have we made reductions in Category 1 already ? #% That is what we should be all about . #% It is hard to overstate the importance of urgent action at Johannesburg . #% For that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals . #% Ensuring that Iraq is run by Iraqis for Iraqis should be an absolute priority . #% Of course , there are exceptions , exceptions so serious that Europe has a responsibility to do what it can to ensure that the inhumanities and atrocities of the past are never repeated . #% Of course , some will say we do not do an ordinary job of work . #% Over recent years the devastation caused has been immense , particularly in Venezuela . #% Any scientist independently retained will tell you that it is complete and total nonsense to expect the United Kingdom to produce the sort of energy levels that the European Union seems to require - which is 20 % from a renewable source - by means of wind farms . #% Could the Commissioner tell us which four Member States are not in that situation ? #% Mr Bradbourn 's traffic-light solution , however , hardly seems appropriate . #% The scheduling of the work of the IGC is extremely important because , if it is scheduled and programmed properly , pressure will grow on the Member States to take more seriously their collective duty to provide leadership for the European Union . #% Madam President , you might find it an amusing issue , but let me tell you that there seems to be one set of rules for the chairmen of groups in this House and a different set of rules for the rest of this House . #% Mr Miller and colleagues need only look at the report from the Commission , look at what has happened to energy costs and to telecommunications costs , to see what can be done . #% Europe , of course , has 305 000 kilometres of coastline . #% Mr President , I should like through you to ask Mr Pomés Ruiz why , of the eight or ten people he nominated , only one could be a woman . #% Fifthly , we have consistently said as a Parliament that we do not want to see expenditure on Afghanistan made to the detriment of other spending priorities in category 4 . #% This fits in , Madam Commissioner , with the Commission 's focus on policy by results , but a broader global vision is needed . #% I hope the Commission understands that it is trade , not aid , that offers the best route to economic recovery . #% As Mr Ettl has said , these are largely technical updates , but still important . #% Mr President , it would have helped if the leader of the Europe of the Nations Group , Sir James Goldsmith , had actually turned up on time . #% Mr President , one of the interesting things in the discussion on Guantanamo Bay concerns language , not least the new definitions of war that we begin to hear , which have no legal basis in any international jurisdiction . #% The African Union urgently needs to help stop the killing in Darfur , where whole villages have been bombed and torched , where mass executions and rape are common and where an Aids crisis is now looming . #% If it is in existence , it does not appear to be very effective . #% That is an important aspect that we would like to persuade the Council to take on board . #% We need to publicise 112 as a lot of people do not know about it . #% Commissioner , I echo the other sentiments -- you have been a very good Commissioner in this area . #% In conclusion , I warmly commend this report to the House today and I would just emphasise again the importance that Parliament attaches to ensuring that the Commission takes this forward in its future strategies . #% Mr President , Mr Wuermeling is right . #% Firstly , the Accession Treaty must be ratified by all Member States . #% In addition , given that there is no evidence of horizontal transmission of TSEs , there would seem to be no scientific requirement for whole-herd slaughter . #% Mr President , I welcomed the Minister 's reply but I would like him to give an assurance to this House that he and the Council will not lose sight in their consideration of this problem of the 604 Kuwaiti citizens who disappeared as a result of the illegal occupation of Kuwait by Iraq and that they will keep pressing the Iraqi authorities for an explanation of the fate of these people . #% 
Thanks to the new proposed new thresholds , companies could work together or alone in putting forward innovative projects that will benefit the industry as a whole . #% I believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government . #% Let me give a good example from the Czech Republic , where an area has been designated to create feeding habitats favourable to partridges and quails and to reduce the erosion of soil and nutrients . #% I hope we will take on board a number of the suggestions in the Marimon report . #% We certainly want to see action by all the institutions , including the Commission , and this Parliament in particular , as a matter of urgency . #% But then neither , on the other hand , do we want to say to third country nationals : ` you can come to the EU but the only jobs you can do are the low-level , manual , nasty jobs that we do n't want to do ' . #% There is also an absence of clarity in the definition of the illegal immigrants to whom the regulation will apply . #% On the final paragraphs where we talk about the cost of the buildings and the total budgetary amounts , we are almost up to EUR 1 billion for Parliament 's budget . #% But I think we also need to ask why people are not reporting . #% The proposed direct aid , when there is a revaluation of over half a percent , must be received by the farmers and not too late to help them . #% This is why the ELDR Group has retabled an amendment we tabled in committee seeking to exclude bona fide journalists from this regulatory provision , not from the whole scope of the directive , and to do so without opening up any loophole that would allow financial analysts to parade themselves as journalists . #% Therefore we need to increase publicity about the objectives of the European Union . #% Here today in the Distinguished Visitors ' Gallery are Alin Teodorescu , as well as the Secretary of State for Adoptions , Theodora Bertzi , Gabriela Coman , responsible for child protection , and , of course , the Minister for Europe , Mrs Boagiu . #% The level of violence the research has already illustrated demonstrates that we still have a very long way to go . #% Finally , President , let us be sure that we work as a European Union to create the conditions which will allow the people of Zimbabwe to express their choices in this election in June and express their choices in secret and without fear . #% I would like to know exactly how we can encourage national authorising officers and others to make this priority clear so we can ensure that accountability of parliamentarians is part of the process that we are engaged in . #% Probably to work in Chinese restaurants satisfying Westerners ' desire for Chinese food . #% What new immediate measures are being put in place to improve the process and what police action has resulted from any of these infringements over the last five years ? #% A further video was offered to the Belgian authorities by the UK police . #% To say , as the Minister did , that the Treaties do not give the EU any powers is untrue . #% It does not help that the United States is unable to settle any of the 17 Uighurs in US territory . #% I would like to make one or two comments on our two proposed amendments , one of which the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism was kind enough to accept , and also some broader points about the whole proposal . #% Is it the end of the world ? #% There is no point in extending the remit of this committee . #% We need to readdress this question . #% At no stage in committee and certainly not in the final vote , was any indication given by the Liberals that they fundamentally disagreed with this report , as they are now doing . #% If we go back to the Delors White Paper , as Mr Harrison has commented , we see that the engine of growth is going to be the micro companies . #% I want to make a second important point about internal market strategy . #% I hope the Portuguese Presidency can work very hard to push this through and make sure that we do get this racism legislation . #% Yet that same spectrum would , of course , be very profitable if were used for telephone communications . #% I hope this is going to set a lead for the entire world , a regulatory regime that will be a benchmark for governments elsewhere . #% We hope , of course , that these will not occur . #% As a co-sponsor with my colleague , Mr Watts , of amendments which were put forward in the trans-European networks on a strategic environmental impact assessment some four years ago at least , I find it quite surprising that it is said to be too early to talk about a comprehensive strategy in this particular direction . #% We may want to ensure that those criteria are applied in a non-discriminatory way , but companies that comply with all the European rules on environment and on employment criteria must be able to tender in a non-discriminatory way . #% Under those circumstances , it would make sense , as has been suggested , to bring the date of the elections forward from June to May , because then the new house in June could already vote on the President and in July we could have the hearings and vote on the Commission as a whole , which could then begin , if that were agreed , already in August or September . #% Finally Commissioner , if this is the case , how do you feel personally about the way in which the Council appears to be backsliding on the commitments made by the European Union at a summit where - and we take great pride in this fact - we played a leadership role ? #% Madam President , on behalf of my Group , I wish to say how profoundly disappointed we were in the conduct of the recent presidential elections in Kazakhstan . #% The Commissioner spoke about the serious incident at the Red Mosque , as indeed did Dr Tannock , who also referred to the suspension of Chief Justice Chaudhry and what followed on from that . #% We intend to support certain of the amendments this morning , particularly where we think there are certain principles which we tamper with at our peril - such as on double criminality and confidentiality in certain professions - and one or two others where we think the concept perhaps needs further definition . #% One major aspect of that is inevitably and rightly a shift away from own-initiative reports from committees , with no legislative impact , to focussing more on legislation . #% They said to us that they accept that liberalization and globalization are inevitable in the future . #% In any event , as the July timetable shows , discussions with Commission staff representatives will be concluded in the near future and many substantial changes in personnel policy that do not require amendment to the Staff Regulations will then be decided by the Commission and implemented immediately . #% As colleagues have said , at this time of fiscal stress , enabling Member States to collect their full dues of taxes is even more important . #% We do not discriminate on fares . #% I never hear any of that spirit of compromise from those who come here and tell us that the drinking of wine is a cultural experience , that somehow it should be left outside all the arrangements and scrutiny of this Parliament . #% Then , perhaps , we will able to fashion the means of arriving at a food system in which people matter , but animals matter too . #% The closures I have seen are because the company wants to survive in business , to continue employing people in high-quality jobs . #% Under this arrangement , the interests of all 27 Member States need to be satisfied , which , of course , means in practice that they will not be . #% I do not accept the answer I was given and the people who I spoke to thought that they were still employed by the Commission . #% Mr President , last Saturday Marie-José the last Queen of Italy and daughter of King Albert of this country died . #% My group agreed that I should table the amendments again in plenary but , unfortunately , no other group was prepared to open up the process . #% I call on the Council and the Commission to join the growing opinion that cluster munitions should be banned completely , and I hope that the rumours that the Commission is going to reduce funding for mine clearance are inaccurate , because it is a human rights issue if people can not move around freely . #% It is time that the Council put the EU 's common values ahead of Member States ' individual commercial interests in that country . #% They had professional uniformed promotion girls distributing handfuls of tendentious propaganda . #% It is all a far cry from the spirit of the single market when the centre right ran Europe . #% Fishermen , as we all know , need to be included in the process . #% That is why the socialists are very proud to be associated with Mr Cornelissen 's report and Mr Kinnock 's communication . #% If there is a problem with this proposal as it stands , we have not done enough on phosphates . #% This report as voted is a bitter disappointment , as is the Commission 's original ill-prepared proposal . #% I very much hope that the Commissioner abandons any attempt at realpolitik , involving dirty compromises in the Council , and sticks to what is Parliament 's clear desire . #% As a result of a lack of generosity , the money will be spent in such a circumscribed fashion that it will only apply to 15 % of the territory of North Cyprus , excluding many villages that voted en bloc for the Annan plan . #% The Labour-controlled county council has decided in its wisdom to cut the number of free school bus passes it gives out . #% I am delighted that Parliament looks as if it is going to insist that there is a five-year time limit . #% It is the price we pay in terms of opportunity cost for the policies we want to have at the level of the European Union and can not afford because the money has been leeched out of the budget . #% It is therefore incumbent on the recipient countries - if I can call them that - to ensure that there is a proper legal and political framework to attract capital . #% Are there any circumstances where the Commission would seek to use qualified majority voting on any of those issues ? #% 
So I would concur with the rapporteur that a new piece of legislation - some kind of new initiative - is required to regulate the mining industry in particular . #% I know we will go forward in future to look at them again and revise them again , but I think we have made a step forward in this area and that Parliament should support the agreement that Mr Cancian reached with the Council in conciliation . #% However , let me use my remaining time to highlight another crucial , but often disregarded area , namely , Amendment No 5 to Article 2 , which seeks to integrate disabled persons into the rehabilitation process . #% The idea now is to open up more quotas for more species . #% And who knows , at this rate we may end up with one reading of the budget . #% According to the Council of Europe , one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime . #% It was therefore to protect the Treaty that we put this special majority requirement in our Rules . #% A resolution has been tabled by the three larger political groups and I want to explain why our group is unable to sign it . #% I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it , you would consider it . #% Our criticism should be constructive , designed to encourage Turkey 's path to modernisation and not to block it . #% Would you please ask the incoming Commission -- assuming that there is one -- to voluntarily submit to the sensible rules of this House , whereby speaking time is measured and limited ? #% After 25 years of elected politics that is an adequate sufficiency , I think . #% The users ' groups I have talked to - in the United Kingdom in particular - have emphasised the importance of encouraging commercial operators and commercial providers of services to make their websites user-friendly for disabled people . #% Mr President , of course some minimum standards are desirable . #% An intensive marketing programme throughout the EU similar to that introduced for beef two years ago , for which I wrote the Parliament 's report , could also play a significant role in boosting consumption and thereby reducing surpluses . #% Madam President , I rise on the same point of order as my colleague , Mr Sturdy . #% This needs to be something which will involve all parts of society , as Mr Bonde has said . #% All our actions should be measured against these yardsticks and we should be under no illusions about the fragility of the situation , which poses major challenges both for ISAF and the other coalition forces operating within the country . #% This would be a victory for ordinary citizens against big business . #% Commissioner de Silguy , if you intend to reply this morning , we would be very grateful for facts and firm commitments rather than simply an analysis of the crisis . #% I make the point now that we will be voting against the amendment to put the Meda money on the line . #% I thank the rapporteur once again . #% In saying that , I am not overlooking the economic benefits of free movement . #% When we have the final figures in the first week or so of next year I will certainly ensure that the honourable Member receives those in detail . #% Does the Commissioner acknowledge that there are questions of urgency in some of the research involved , as well as the fundamental debate on first principles and that this should not be an area in which there is unnecessary filibustering by any ethical committee or group ? #% This is a serious injustice which continues to cause great resentment against the European Union in general as well as the common fisheries policy . #% Since that time , Portuguese Governments have felt that there was a geographic imbalance which should be corrected and the Portuguese authorities raised the matter with us on a number of occasions . #% To the extent that this is valid , it justifies the welcome change of heart by the Austrian Presidency towards a conviction that there must be agreement on minimum standards for fair legal proceedings . #% Many of those cultures and traditions are not enjoyed in the same way as perhaps they are enjoyed in Germany or Austria . #% There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper . #% I say that because he comes from a small political group - and it is often hard to make headway here - and he comes from one of the southern Member States , which will in some ways have to make sacrifices and introduce regulations to bring about effective , proper beef labelling throughout the Community . #% Mr President , I welcome strongly the fact that the 700 pages are going to be published . #% However , I also want to comment on the three key issues that colleagues have commented on , the first of which concerns prohibitions and in particular compromise amendment 42 . #% I have read few reports - even from the Commission - that have been stuffed so full of three and four-letter acronyms . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has received assurances from Croatia that it will help other countries in the region qualify for EU membership . #% But Europe can not work either without strong leadership . #% Without the basic systemic capacities in place in all countries , it will not be possible to do what politically has already been agreed upon : to scale up disease prevention and controlled programmes for reducing child and maternal mortality and roll back HIV/Aids , TB and malaria . #% For these reasons , as the report currently stands - I stress as it currently stands - I regret I will not be able to support it . #% Despite short rains and locust infestation , food production this year was in fact only 11 % below the five-year average . #% I would ask the Commissioner to indicate how the European Union as a whole can take an active role , so that the operators of APIs are encouraged and helped to come together . #% Therefore I would ask that in future we start to try to keep some discipline about time . #% Energy efficiency should be a priority for the EU , in particular , as it is the most effective way of cutting costs for consumers across the EU . #% It will also enhance the concept and implementation of universal service so that everyone is information-rich and cultural diversity is maintained . #% Doping , finally , is a symptom of the over-commercialisation of sport . #% Fortunately , Members of this Parliament are protected by parliamentary privilege , but even then , Commissioner Kinnock , I would ask you to note the reasonably restrained language that there is in our resolution and if I may just quote to you briefly on what the resolution says - `` it deems his conduct to be particularly open to criticism ' . #% The achievements are good but they are still not good enough . #% Certainly , there is an issue about bridging the mandate gap . #% We agree that China needs to shoulder a growing international responsibility because of its status as a permanent member of the Security Council and now as the world 's fourth largest economy . #% However , I want to say that there is great concern and anxiety about this particular Commission initiative and , indeed , about Mr Costa 's report , although I personally feel that many of those concerns were fully addressed in committee where , I know , there was widespread cross-party support for Mr Costa 's work . #% Similarly , Amendment No 6 speaks about young people and encouraging them to take part in youth programmes by not giving them the extra burden of visas . #% A successful single currency will improve the single market , which will contribute to growth and high levels of employment , commensurate with Article 2 of the Treaty of the European Union . #% If you believe Britain wastes public money , multiply that inefficiency when considering EU projects like this . #% It was an excellent report but by the time it came out of our committee earlier this week a lot of the more excellent parts of it were unfortunately removed . #% For example , within the United Kingdom , where in many ways the circumstances are amongst the most favourable within the European Union , 50 % of the ozone is created by emissions outside the UK . #% We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall , Madam President , that at the beginning of the last session , I raised with you the question of whether , in the interests of openness and transparency , the Members ' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet . #% Has the World Health Organisation contradicted it ? #% Having seen what happened to Manchester United when they visited Turkey a few years ago , I fear the worst this evening . #% The resolution sets a positive tone for future discussions and illustrates this Parliament 's willingness to engage positively with our oldest trading partner . #% Mr President , I am sure everyone here today will be aware that last Thursday there was a general election in Britain . #% Such democratic exposure is not at odds with ensuring the functional independence of the ECB ; such ideas are complementary . #% in writing . - Conservatives abstained on this report as it forms part of the European objective to develop an area for freedom , security and justice - instead preferring an intergovernmental approach . #% It is no easy thing to expect the international community to engage with those yet to renounce violence , but until that time comes , we have no alternative if we wish to move forward . #% I should like this put on record . #% If this year 's conciliation is anything like last year 's then I for one have no desire to attend . #% On the question of services , a redundant bank teller or hotel receptionist is just as unemployed as a redundant factory worker . #% This will allow qualified professionals to take advantage of the single market and use their skills to drive home the advantages for growth and jobs that an internal market for services must deliver . #% 
I welcome the fact that she has moved from daily measuring to weekly measuring in exceptional circumstances , but I would like her to move further to weekly measurements , to go back to the main body of the text as in the common position . #% This is a huge problem for small businesses . #% There are answers to the problems which have come forward , and I believe he can find them in this report . #% We should not just be given an excuse and some sort of non-answer . #% All power to your elbow ! #% There can be no argument for paramilitary justice for any sector of the community and my Group believes there never has been . #% Every year , every month , far into the night , we deal with directives designed to reduce emissions , but we also know that in most instances when we encounter the Council or their representatives it is extremely difficult to get the Member States to agree to these proposals in their original , very demanding form . #% The UK Conservatives have been consistent . #% The British Government does not have a leg to stand on . #% Then I took this scenario a step further : a few years down the line , they get divorced , as happens often enough , what happens then ? #% We recognise that there are choices to be made in how we try to develop our economies and that the pursuit of competition and more liberalisation is a mistaken path if we really want to make full use of the Lisbon Agenda . #% I would have liked to see more on the social economy . #% The European Union is going through turbulent times . #% Mr President , we are quite properly concerned about the spread of small arms and light weapons , particularly the illegal traffick in , and uncontrolled circulation of , these weapons . #% Get the ministers to do their jobs properly and it will be done well without needing new structures . #% He has worked very hard on it and moved it quite fast , in parliamentary terms . #% The Council and the Commission have also indicated that they think it is none of the European Parliament 's business to issue awkward declarations on issues which are basically sub judice . #% Our overall concern is that the common European security and defence policy is indeed a further step towards European political integration and that is our fundamental objection . #% You have managed to ignore the French referendum result , you have managed to ignore the Dutch referendum result and you have managed to bully the Irish into submission the second time around . #% France , Germany , Belgium and Austria are not countries so poor or with soil so poor that no other crops can grow there . #% Yes , we must recognise Taiwan as one of the most important trading entities for the EU , but here we are being asked to go further . #% Finally and most importantly it has been agreed that the consumer health policy unit will remain in Brussels . #% We agree : investment in research and development , in trans-European networks for transport , energy and telecommunications should be increased . #% He might like to have a word with Mr Corbett before answering . #% We shall also rescue Europe 's consumers from the over-interference that some colleagues are proposing . #% The rapporteur made a valiant effort and we tried to help him to give legal certainty to employers when it comes to solar radiation . #% We feel that the joint resolution does not acknowledge that if Rwanda is crossing the border into the Congo to put an end to the activity of the armed gangs , it is happening in the context of MONUC having failed to do the disarming . #% That ruling is tantamount to creating two different forms of abstention . #% It has received cross-party , cross-nationality support and it will now go forward to the Commission and the Council . #% This is a very welcome report and I congratulate our rapporteur . #% Management at this level allows for a high degree of coordination and exchange of best practice between those involved . #% You have our support for robust , effective and proportionate measures . #% Lastly , the security fence which has considerably reduced the number of terrorist suicide bombing missions into Israel proper is not necessarily the final border of the two states . #% It is estimated that of the 1 500 people on average who die each year , some 300 a year , on average , could survive if evacuation measures within aircraft were improved . #% Article 5 ( i ) concerned with the fitness for duty of seafarers seems remiss on the question of new members , masters , officers or ratings joining a ship just after they had been travelling for some time before arrival on board . #% I have tabled some amendments to this report either to correct minor errors or owing to setbacks in committee , but these do not detract from the importance and significance of the report . #% However , it is vital , as this report points out , that this directive should apply to dependent territories , such as the Channel Islands . #% We can not , and we do not , support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich . #% Having said that , I regret some of the statements made in the report criticising the United Kingdom and other countries , on matters to which there are no easy answers . #% The report is balanced because it not only tackles air pollution at source but also takes into account the very legitimate concerns of a very successful European industry . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros and the rapporteur on their work . #% I should like to press the President-in-Office on that point . #% We must ensure that we are never hypocritical in the defence of human rights , and 11 September must teach us surely that the same rules must be applied regardless of whether a country is our enemy or our friend . #% We should help Iraq build a peaceful society . #% You have the measurements , make sure you look at those before you take a final decision . #% I hope colleagues will agree that this underlines the need to reform our Rules of Procedure . #% By issuing grades and awarding qualifications it will ensure that the EU bypasses universities and national governments . #% We want to know what we can do about reducing our dependence on imported oil and gas . #% The issues raised by this judgment and by the complaints strike at the very heart of the issues and barriers that he is proposing to sweep away with his excellent proposal . #% I am certain , therefore , that an island such as Malta , with its population of 340 000 can not accommodate the rigidities of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater . #% Also , with the oral question that we have tabled for the House tonight , we are asking the Commissioner to come back to this House with the results of the final proposal so that we can ensure he delivers what we are all looking for : the optimum framework to carry the European institutions forward in this current century with an optimum personnel policy for the independent and quality staff we are looking for across the institutions . #% Mr President , I am sorry to make a second point of order when I still have not made my maiden speech in this House . #% This is a European issue because such readings are far above EU bathing water limits and , incidentally , also a cross-border issue since Thames Water is German owned . #% I am afraid that Commissioner Andor did not give us that assurance at the time of his confirmation hearing , but I trust that President Barroso will now . #% We have either met or exceeded all of the proposals made by the Committee of Independent Experts apart from literally a couple of exceptions which , put to the test of practicality , could not be pursued . #% I call upon the House to support this resolution . #% On this matter , Commissioner , I beg to differ with you on a particular problem in Belgium with an electronic company about which I spoke to you only about three or four weeks ago . #% author . - Mr President , I felt it necessary to rise on two points . #% As I have said many times in these debates , in my view the biggest weakness of these countries is the administration and the judicial system and the lack of modernisation and investment . #% We know that the car companies will continue to make and must make huge investments in the next generation of lighter and more fuel-efficient cars that we want , and our colleague from the Green Party made that point earlier ; but those investments will come from profits -- there is not going to be any state subsidy for those -- and what we want are profitable car companies . #% You only have to look at our postbags to see that we are not delivering in the area of civil justice . #% These are big numbers . #% Moreover , we have to protect consumers who are particularly vulnerable . #% During the recent Joint Parliamentary Committee meeting in Turkey , we brought up the issue of the Leyla Zana trial , as we always do . #% So we expect leadership in Pakistan and in the European Union . #% Because of that I believe , with the Commissioner , that the way in which animals are kept reflects on us morally , but also practically , in that bad conditions for animals affect the health and safety of humans as well . #% 
I will not go into the details of the background , but it is the contention of myself , those people supporting him and the Fair Trials Abroad organisation that he is completely innocent of any charges . #% If we can not get this issue right , what chance and likelihood is there of getting all the other , very many more complex issues put to right ? #% There have been rumours in the media -- which we always believe -- of dark deeds in the Commission : ` Barroso mugs Dimas ' , we read in the headlines . #% To conclude , this debate is something which is to be welcomed . #% Those who knowingly scheme to evade and avoid taxes do harm to society and should not expect leniency when they are caught , and we must have the tools to catch them . #% Nevertheless I applaud the aims and coherence of the Huhne report as a basis for defining accountability of the Central Bank , on which I should like to say a few words , particularly on the issue of transparency and accountability . #% It is our task to build credible and workable partnerships through dialogue and consultation between our respective parliaments . #% Mr President , I would like to add my support to Pauline Green . #% I now know that care in the community in the United Kingdom does not work . #% I would like to draw attention to one or two points from it . #% I have no doubt that over the years there have been abuses of Tamils and that on occasion security forces have acted with insufficient regard for ordinary Tamil people in the areas of conflict . #% It is not clear whether there will be any control of the demand side of energy , as there is through EU energy efficiency legislation , or whether environmental considerations , such as the control of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions , have been given adequate attention . #% We do not mention the fact that China 's concern about the Yasukuni Shrine is reflected in the recently revealed fact that the Japanese Emperor refused to visit it once class-A war criminals were included there . #% Before we extend the competences and financial resources of Europol , the British Conservatives believe that there is a need to establish whether competence should be ceded to them in this field or other fields or whether the total priority should be interstate cooperation , utilising present national resources . #% Mr Coelho referred to it earlier on . #% Mr President , like some of the previous speakers this evening , I am very pleased the Council came forward with this proposal . #% We will continue to work with the Tunisian authorities to implement the commitments on democracy , good governance and human rights that it signed up to in its European neighbourhood policy action plan . #% Mr President , following the Council ' s recent decision on the easing of sanctions relating to the Kosovo crisis the Commission is putting forward a proposal for the exemption of Kosovo and Montenegro from particular EC sanctions against the former Republic of Yugoslavia . #% Perhaps it is now time for Plan B. #% So I would like to repair that omission and propose the very simple oral amendment : ` and the parliaments of the Member States ' . #% Thirdly , we were interested in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting , concerned about the valuation of the euro because so much could have been counterfeited . #% Mr President , I appreciate that wide-ranging coverage of the issues by Mr Corrie . #% in writing . - Performing art has flourished for thousands of years and in every society on Earth . #% The question is what do the Members who are not here think ? #% When we dealt , for example , with the directive on vibration , we were told that we must exclude whole-body vibration because -- and this was used in the tabloid press -- what we were trying to do was to prevent farmers from driving their tractors for more than three or four hours even at the height of the harvest , which was nonsense . #% I have only time to deal with one specific area , and it does not in any sense detract from my belief that the effective regulation of dangerous pesticides must be a priority task of this Parliament , and , indeed , this Commission . #% Perhaps the Commissioner could say a word on what the FVO is doing about looking at the movement of foodstuffs into the country , given some of the problems we have had in recent times . #% But this package is disconnected from that , and quite rightly so . #% I am sorry to say that the deadline of 3 December this year has been missed by many Member States . #% With a EUR 18.5 million contribution to support the electoral process and the deployment of a skilled observation mission , including an experienced delegation from this House , the EU is showing the Palestinians the path to effective democracy . #% When Europe introduces higher standards -- as I believe it must -- we have to be sure that everything else entering Europe meets the same high standards . #% Each country has its own immediate priorities for getting themselves out of their financial difficulties . #% We should also place on record our appreciation to the Ombudsman and to his staff for the calm and efficient way in which they discharge their functions . #% Do not let us forget the half million Kurdistani people whose lives have been taken away from them by Baghdad since they were invaded in the north with chemical weapons in August 1988 shortly after Saddam was driven out of Iran . #% I hope that one of the things to come out of this debate today - that we take back to our Member States , and the Commission and the Council take back - is that we are very concerned about how this regional development happens , how we deal with this and the role that culture can play in that . #% We should like to suggest that , since this is a very important process and moment in our legislative cycle , and to enable the Commission and Parliament to approach it in a constructive way , the annual state of the Union address could be combined with a resolution from Parliament on key political priorities and then go to the committees for more detailed debate . #% He will be offered the job of head of the Court of Auditors in the Catalan Government , and no doubt will be taking it up very shortly . #% A growing number of scientists are now challenging the conventional methodology , which is based on doses of external radioactive rays rather than internally ingested or inhaled particles . #% They do not want to see bit-by-bit privatization , as profitable postal services are hived off to the private sector under the guise of EU competition policy . #% As the internal market develops , our citizens really need a legal framework that guarantees them access to justice wherever they are and whatever their problems . #% A third of the population are displaced people living in other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina . #% ECHO is already under enormous strain - up to 15 , 000 contracts in 1995 alone . #% We must not let the trees of myriad disagreements on specific issues obscure the wood of an overwhelming interest in common values and objectives , and action on promotion of democracy and human rights , resolution of conflicts and protection against security threats among others . #% Mr President , there is clear evidence that Europe 's legendary social model and Member States ' systems of social protection are failing to meet the new challenges of changing patterns of work , changing economic , social and demographic patterns and the globalization of markets . #% This report nuances Parliament 's role and enhances our ability to control and monitor the implementation of legislation in Member States . #% We wish to be humanitarian but this is an issue that can and must be dealt with by the EU as a whole . #% In this case , peaceful means are not only unexhausted , they are being deliberately avoided . #% Recent press reports on the new approach to legislation dating from the 1980s and '90s - not so new now - which allowed the detail of legislation to be worked out by industry-led standardisation organisations , seem to indicate that this is not always the best way forward . #% We need a common agreement . #% There are claims by locals that members of the local Sharia Court which tried her , have themselves had adulterous relationships which on occasions have resulted in the birth of children . #% In pursuing such a process we always include references to humanitarian aid , the restoration of civil institutions and respect for the law . #% Parliament expects you to ensure that these national allocation plans meet the goals required of the emissions trading scheme , and many Member States which are genuinely committed and have submitted their plans already will be backing you and want you to ensure that there is a level playing field and that the others fall into line . #% We need to have greater and more succinct information on how our citizens can access this right to the information contained within the documents . #% What we have to be firm on is that we are not going to spend the next ten years debating the same . #% The whole system is essentially a racket for those not eligible for legitimate immigration . #% We could not just go forward with a disability directive , and then an age directive , because I thought sexual orientation and religion would be left behind . #% Mr President , I have to say by way of prologue how refreshing it is to hear a government minister admit he does not know any more about a situation than we do . #% There are great lessons there for us in the Convention and in the IGC . #% In day-to-day practice , since we have implemented the code , the answer to the question on the oral paper today about whether the code of administrative behaviour is in practice incorporated in the activities of the Commission is yes . #% The directive is typical of the monolithic actions that they seek to reject . #% It is the world 's largest Muslim country . #% We must first make sure that existing legislation in the same field is being implemented across the European Union . #% A development I can not support as a sovereignist . #% It is not just about huge amounts of development money ; the aid needs to be sustainable . #% May I congratulate not only the rapporteur , but also my own colleague , Hermann Vermeer , for his excellent work in leading the search for a compromise and breaking the early deadlock between the two sides of the House , one insisting that voluntary agreements should never have a role , and the other saying that legislation should never have a role . #% At the same time , some individuals , some traders and some companies who would otherwise trade with Cuba are playing safe and holding off . #% 
We want more spending on SYNERGY . #% Second , alongside the inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading scheme , will the Council propose instruments in parallel to tackle the full climate impact of aviation since , as we know , the Emissions Trading Scheme will not cover emissions that are not CO2 related ? #% One last important point : you did not talk about the need for the imposition of a no-fly zone . #% Finally , placing this Directive into a broader context , to ensure that it is compatible with the Sixth Environment Action Programme , makes good sense and demonstrates that the EU is capable of joined-up thinking and a sensible approach to this matter . #% The reason for the urgency is that this subject also relates very much to the ongoing debate about media concentration and to development in the field of broadband communications , particularly in the light of what is happening in television and broadcasting at the moment . #% Mercifully , since the agreed ceasefire on 25 November 2003 , we are now witnessing one of the most peaceful periods in terms of military action since the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war : a ceasefire that has survived serious provocations to the Government of India , including the Mumbai terrorist bombings . #% We are now left with the worst possible solution : the Constitution is dead , but we have the structures and methods to govern a unitary state still in place . #% I have with me a strong statement - of this morning - by Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto , Chairperson of the Pakistan People 's Party , in which she welcomes this report for drawing attention to the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people ; for reaffirming the EU 's commitment to the settlement of dispute by peaceful means ; for taking note of the impact of the earthquake and urging the European Union to help and support the Kashmiris ; for supporting the role of the composite peace process in moving towards a durable settlement for the Kashmiris based on democracy , the rule of law and fundamental rights ; for urging the Indian and Pakistan Governments to facilitate the ceasefire on the Line of Control by calling further on militant armed groups to enrol in a disarmament , demobilisation and rehabilitation process ; for encouraging the Pakistan Government to transform the ceasefire in place in Siachin since 2003 into a lasting peace agreement ; for urging both governments to allow international human rights organisations immediate and unrestricted access to all parts of the former princely state in order to investigate the human rights situation there ; for calling on the Indian Government to put an end to all practices of extrajudicial killings , ` disappearances ' , torture and arbitrary detentions in Jammu and Kashmir ; for calling on the Indian and Pakistani authorities to ease restrictions on travel between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad ; for urging Pakistan to revisit its concepts of fundamental rights of freedom of expression , freedom of association , freedom of religious practices in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit and Baltistan ; for calling for the first-ever elections to be held in Gilgit and Baltistan and for seeking higher democratic representation in the Northern Areas . #% Finally , we also need to ensure that the rights of people living near areas vulnerable to disasters are protected . #% I would like to see more proactive input from the Commission as regards the accession countries , and the degree to which they are abiding not only by the old framework but also looking to adopt the new framework . #% Even if the Commission tonight opposes the extension of this directive to inter-urban services , it should give us a clear commitment in advance to implement the study which it has launched . #% Healthcare workers from across the European Union visited us , visited the Parliament , desperate for our help . #% Truck drivers must be part of this operation and carry out thorough checks on their vehicles to ensure there is nobody on board . #% It adds that on internal policies the risk of errors will persist unless the legal framework is changed . #% We only heard last night that this was about to happen when it was too late for us to do anything about it . #% It is also a beginning in the sense that what we now need - and we have seen it all before in Bosnia - is the full commitment of the international community to the stability and security and reconstruction of Kosovo . #% When the existing Legislative Council is abolished new elections must be held within a matter of months as both Mr Titley and Commissioner Kinnock have indicated . #% I believe it is important to have a single European market in the defence production and procurement sector , which is vital for the future of the European Union . #% If he can get those types of concessions from the arbitration deal on 25 September he will have done the Windward Islands a tremendous favour . #% We must stop this incoherence and achieve a clear and assertive EU competence , but that policy must be determined to safeguard our privacy . #% And why should the European Union agree in these circumstances to abide by an agreement which in so far as it accepts the idea of withholding support for investment in expropriated properties goes along with an element of the Helms-Burton Act ? #% A final point : we have heard nothing about the results of the EU troika that went to southern Africa in the middle of last month . #% I do not , however , welcome the proposed agenda in the field of justice and home affairs . #% I implore you all to live up to the responsibility this position carries and make representations to the President of Pakistan , appealing for clemency for Mirza Tahir Hussain . #% The report calls for reduction in stocking density , minimum depth of litter , improved ventilation and a nesting period of at least six hours of uninterrupted darkness . #% Members from all over this House were rightly emphasising how important policy coherence is , yet here we have an outstanding example of policy incoherence . #% He has recently petitioned this Parliament because his Local Education Authority has failed to allocate him a place in any of the schools of his choice in his local area , even after what can only be described as a flawed appeals process . #% Tajikistan still bears the scars of a brutal civil war between secular and Jihadi forces that erupted after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s . #% I thank the Commissioner for that helpful answer and I am very pleased to hear that these issues are being taken seriously . #% Mr President , as this report rightly observes , next year is an election year and our electorates will be asked once again to vote for their MEPs . #% Our responsibilities are primarily -- as they should be -- to the vast majority of innocent men , women and children in our various countries and their rights : their rights to enjoy their lives without fear of violence or sudden death perpetrated by these appalling terrorists . #% It is no good just saying we regret that they do not live up to EU criteria . #% It is time that we restored some perspective to this and stopped undermining the work of our regulatory bodies . #% We do not know how the issue of correlation tables is going to be resolved , and this topic perfectly illustrates the confusion that so-called codecision can lead to . #% If voting against this report has an effect on them , that is unfortunate and is not something that we would wish to see . #% It has rightly been said that research should be conducted in Africa , by Africans , for Africans and , where appropriate , with the support , cooperation and partnership of the Western world , along the lines of the IAVI initiative between Oxford and Nairobi . #% Mr President , we are really here tonight to comment about the nuclear industry , but having heard the Commission 's initial response it is fair to say that it is not adequate and is certainly lacking in seriousness and complacent . #% These are the key people in developing countries who understand social , political and cultural issues which we , when we parachute in to observe elections , might not be aware of . #% We must be a campaigning Parliament for the Constitution . #% It was Tony Blair who reached a ground-breaking agreement with British Telecom to connect every school in Britain to the Internet . #% These are important amendments which everyone in this Parliament should support . #% I feel this is a very worthwhile and challenging document . #% If the Council would look at paragraph 10 of the resolution that we will vote at lunchtime today it will see that we insist that in Florence these deletions from the Commission text be reinserted , and that is the text which should then be endorsed by the Council . #% All too often the cries of those people whose economy depended on tourists and whose contribution to the economy was worth six times that of the farmers went totally unheeded . #% We hope that situations like Kosovo will not happen again , but if they do we must ensure that we are prepared . #% However , I regret that it failed over voting weights , which is essentially a technical issue , when it would have been better had it failed by rejecting in principle this massive step in European integration for which there is no public demand . #% We also had meetings with Italian ministers and were able to express our thanks for the additional deployment of troops in the Balkans , allowing British special forces to be deployed in another theatre . #% The Commission has recently received a report from the Hearing Officer who was appointed , through the proper procedures , to give consideration to all relevant information in Mrs Andreasen 's case . #% Madam President , my request was a clarification . #% I welcome your commitment to better regulation , President-in-Office , but as you have heard today the biggest gain in better regulation will be to stop the European Parliament wandering around Europe , so that we can better focus on legislation . #% Mr President , my group is broadly supportive of Mrs van den Burg 's efforts on her report . #% They have also resisted the temptation to destabilise Afghanistan and have indicated they will not attempt to foment instability in Iraq in the event of Saddam Hussein 's departure from the scene . #% If there were prizes for rhetoric , the EU would be a world-class performer . #% As was mentioned in Question Time to the Commission , I have constituents whose daughter was attacked and murdered in a youth hostel earlier this year . #% The provisions that currently exist , in employment for example , start to look somewhat ineffectual when one realizes that they do not apply to 96 % of companies , that is those employing less than 20 staff . #% But , certainly , preventive measures are being considered and being put in place in the Member States . #% We should look at those agreements , we should emulate them and we should give our citizens their fundamental rights and their fundamental freedoms . #% We pay the bills . #% I am pleased we have not gone for the multicoloured flags . #% This Parliament strongly supports an economic reform agenda balanced with the process of monetary union . #% It is all a long way from the original intention of the fund . #% They are canned or boxed with the supermarkets ' own labels or they are placed in specialist chilled containers for the restaurant and pub market for easy sale by the glass . #% So , are we to keep on re-evaluating the evidence until we get the result that Mr Lannoye wants ? #% Clearly there is a terrible situation here , which throws into question our ability within the European Union of translating the Treaty into appropriate action . #% This is something that has not happened in the UK for over 70 years , and we want to make sure it does not start to happen again . #% Mr President , I would like to bring to public attention another example of the European Union 's hypocrisy when it comes to addressing environmental matters . #% 
Virginity is examined on the whim of the police , women are dragged into hospitals and physically examined . #% It is only if we can clearly show that the Commission 's use of money is managed in a sound and prudent way that we can hope to win back the trust that has been lost over recent years . #% It is up to us all to raise our voices in protest and it is even more important that Zimbabwe 's neighbours condemn the atrocities . #% There is much talk but little action and such action as there is often unhelpful . #% I will not be supporting this report . #% In recent years , my own work has increasingly involved representing European interests in advancing global CSR mechanisms . #% Unless this House accepts that explanation , which I do not , I ask you to make that check . #% If it were , we would be attacking many countries around the world . #% Rather than banning flags of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet , under the 1995 EU directive on port state control , national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations . #% No British Parliament has ever voted to pass British taxpayers ' public money to third parties who can not be trusted . #% We must all make this a top priority , including the new US Administration . #% The report now calls for higher targets : 40 % after 6 years and 50 % after 12 years . #% Mr Cox has mentioned possible conflicts , which I think are more than probable , with the GATT clauses and the specific World Trade Organization agreement . #% Lest I be thought chauvinist in raising the problem of Britons in Greece , let me criticise my own government in the UK . #% Will he , in the Nice Treaty or in the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Nice at the end of the year , propose codecision between Parliament and the Council on matters of common foreign and security policy ? #% It is right for the EU to take over from NATO and a convincing demonstration that we are serious about playing a larger security role . #% There is still no easy acceptance across Europe of higher-education qualifications . #% Mr President , I too should like to congratulate you on your first session as a Vice-President of Parliament . #% I get a lot of casework from people who still have problems with their health card . #% I should now like to turn to Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 . #% Europe needs direction on economic reform . #% I therefore voted against the amended proposal and against the legislative resolution . #% However , we should like to restate that great attention needs to be paid to ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is completely respected in each and every aspect of policy in this important area . #% I also want to congratulate the Committee on Petitions ' vice-chair and rapporteur , Mrs Ahern , on her excellent report on behalf of the committee . #% For other businesses the answer may be to look towards technical textiles , ranging from specialist heat - and chemical-resistant materials to flight socks designed to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis . #% We should have a proper , on-demand work permit scheme , especially for skilled workers . #% Mr President , what Mr Bourlanges said just now about the lack of time in Strasbourg is somewhat exaggerated . #% I would like to know what the Commissioner 's position is . #% We would hope that a more rational approach would be taken by the Commission and that the issues which currently present themselves in this proposal can be resolved in that way . #% We are clearly facing a development catastrophe at the hands of the AIDS pandemic . #% The EU failed to establish a common stance , let alone any joint initiatives , to press the US to release our own citizens from Guantanamo Bay . #% We look towards enlargement and encourage good practice , yet here in our institutions we still continue to discriminate . #% I am pleased to say that the equal funding is being used for at least one such project involving the UK . #% The official EPA review due to be completed last December failed to provide a full and comprehensive report of the status of negotiations . #% I hope that campaign will be launched during the British Presidency with full backing from Member States and consumer groups . #% The nub of the problem is how this can be achieved while ensuring a broad consensus amongst EU Member States . #% We also need more joined-up thinking , more explicit connections between the IPP project , the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and the Strategy for Sustainable Development . #% This position is supported by the Cypriot and Greek governments and Parliament would be reactionary should it fail to be in the vanguard of progress here . #% It is present in the financial anxieties which beset the one area - food safety - which we had intended to be freestanding and no longer part of these general debates . #% It seems to achieve some of the results that it actually expects . #% It is an important step towards allowing the speakers of minority languages or the languages of Catalonia , Wales , Ireland , Sardinia etc. to appeal to the European Parliament in their own language . #% Insecurity leads to demotivation , and that is part of the problem that the European economy is facing . #% Finally , I criticized the Commission publicly yesterday in committee for not having sent us some information they promised . #% I hope that you can give us some quick and clear promises about this because we are very concerned that this is done quickly . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the ECR Group strongly supports European enlargement . #% It is indeed national governments who actually spend some 80 % of the EU budget , and most criticisms of the Court of Auditors relate to them , rather than to the European institutions . #% The UK has a completely uncontrolled , unlimited and chaotic immigration and asylum system . #% To what extent does the existing programme deal with the years of collective amnesia in Western Europe , perhaps not so much in Germany and Austria , where there were always historical and family links , but in other countries where the shadow of the iron curtain still exists . #% But of course , as others have said , this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate , woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness . #% That will not achieve results . #% Surely , ad hoc tribunals such as those in former Yugoslavia or Rwanda are a much better solution . #% Following on from that question , Commissioner , I should like to raise the issue of derogation and the issue of regulations that are being unilaterally applied by some countries that have not applied for derogation . #% There is no such thing as a stereotype . #% I would also like to congratulate Mr De Rossa on a cogent report , and join him in thanking Mr Söderman for his services as Ombudsman and Mr Diamandouros for his time served to date . #% I commend this report . #% I would also like to hear what the Commissioner plans to do about these longer-term systemic issues . #% Mr President , I am very conscious of the time but I do have a point of order under Rule 41 which deals with Question Time . #% I believe that it is inadequate and that there is far too little attention paid to the need to seek a political solution in Sri Lanka . #% Mistakes can be made . #% We have to find a way of strengthening the ability of all the European institutions to carry on taking a leading role in international human rights and anti-discrimination work . #% Mr President , Commissioner , colleagues , I would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on her report and thank the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities for adopting so many of the conclusions produced by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% I welcome this report , which calls for a voluntary agreement on road safety and pedestrian protection , with a view to more binding legislation in the future . #% As the rapporteur said , they came up with a compromise of 100 and then 50 grammes . #% I even wondered whether Mr Blair 's drive to have less regulation and to scrap unnecessary laws might slow you up a little bit ; but no , undaunted you have produced the most ambitious work programme ever seen in the history of the European Union . #% Nevertheless , our intentions are clear . #% You know that I support the introduction of this card . #% 
I am sure that by broadcasting the facts and enabling a true analysis of the Treaty we will contribute to an honest debate which will persuade people that this Constitution is worth having . #% Commissioner Patten will visit Sri Lanka on 25 and 26 November 2003 as planned . #% It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it . #% We need to know in particular what happened to the young Tibetan monk Ngawang Jangchub , who died in October during a ` patriotic education ' session . #% I would appreciate it if the Minutes could be changed to reflect that particular assurance he gave this House . #% But thank you for the start . #% We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying . #% We have now the Green Paper from the Commission and the conclusions of the Council meeting last week . #% It is a bit like the Reform Treaty . #% Men are also likely to receive bonuses and are less likely to work part-time where the wages are the lowest . #% In the context of what we have been discussing , the security of this House , I wonder if you would follow this up and see what steps have been taken to improve security and report on that particular incident last November . #% However , before doing so , Hamas must not only renounce violence , but also hand in its weapons to the Palestine security forces . #% We therefore need Russia 's help to persuade Iran not to build nuclear bomb . #% However , we have had to say it over and over again . #% I would like to thank the civil servants in the Commission for the work that they have done on this . #% Mr President , I too should like to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on this report . #% We have to recognize with the single currency that we still want some national diversity . #% Let us hope that a proper implementation of CFP reform will prevent any such crises arising in the future . #% We do need to test chemicals . #% This report on minimum standards is one important part of the evolution of this common policy . #% When we see what is happening to them , even the most committed amongst us may begin to have our doubts . #% So you have almost got your Treaty . #% This Parliament , elected by citizens across the whole of Europe , with parties from left to right across the political spectrum , parties in government and parties in opposition , will send a powerful signal if it endorses the Constitution tomorrow by an overwhelming majority . #% In 2003 we will have a very good opportunity , in the e-commerce directive , to gather the information and the wisdom obtained from those Member States which have chosen either to opt in or to opt out . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I should like to add my thanks to Mrs Jöns for this splendid initiative . #% We must not be under-ambitious on energy efficiency . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his achievement . #% I say to him and others that you can not have real prosperity and real security for 350 million people in 15 countries if you deny hope and similar rights to your neighbours . #% Since 1963 , Syria has operated under a state of perpetual emergency , which is the legal basis for many of the repressive instruments imposed by the government and which it justifies on the grounds of the ongoing conflict with Israel following Syria 's loss of the Golan Heights in 1967 and the struggle against Islamist terrorists who oppose the secular socialist state . #% I must confess that I am again in contravention of the EU Working Time Directive and , as a good European , I should not break European law . #% They are tasks which are way beyond you if you are physically or mentally ill or disabled . #% It potentially makes a big difference , both to the degree of privacy infringement and to the degree of openness and democracy in decision-making , whether that proposal is based in EU law or is simply intergovernmental . #% So when we look at what we are spending where , we should think very carefully about refusing a budget to actions that are proven to make a difference . #% The Committee on Civil Liberties has had a valuable meeting with parliamentarians from these applicant countries to discuss the whole judiciary and home affairs area . #% The other part that the Committee was very interested in was the contradictory procedure . #% Clearly , in Kosovo President Milosevic believes he is strong enough to challenge that international community and its resolve . #% Even today , surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China ' s Communist Party . #% We shall be voting in favour . #% There was another example in the press this morning . #% For this reason , the ECR Group has abstained . #% They are claiming , wrongly , that this would outlaw financing of political parties that are opposed to the European Union . #% I do not think that is acceptable , if I may say so , and I am sorry that your predecessor in the Chair has gone away . #% Mr President , last month in Strasbourg I raised a similar point of order under Rule 130 , because Council Question Time , which was supposed to last an hour , lasted no more than 35 minutes . #% The first is the reform of the labour markets . #% In this case , the UK Independence Party , which I have the honour to represent , strongly supports the immediate setting up of an inquiry into the Commission 's handling of this matter . #% Could the Commissioner tell us a little bit about those Member States and their technical reservations ? #% In the case of final-salary schemes , as indeed with public service pensions , the concept is that young people pay for the old ; that one generation supports the next . #% Therefore , we want Mrs Andreasen to come and tell us exactly what her allegations are . #% We should be sure that we consider these operations carefully . #% Publication will be made by the buying authority at the time it publishes the call for tender , so there will be no additional bureaucracy involved . #% Membership of the World Health Organisation is restricted to nation states . #% Mr President , Britain currently enjoys a tax derogation on red diesel that applies to leisure boating . #% It is Parliament 's wish from last year and we want to ensure that this money on Rechar and Retex is indeed spent . #% Therefore , whatever the fine rhetoric that might flow from this House , the true aim of this particular European Year is to promote further European integration . #% The West must offer assistance , so I particularly welcome this resolution 's call on OECD countries to provide resources for this . #% In principle , some might view this as a positive development , since it could provide the UK with new market opportunities in other Member States . #% There are estimates that training and preventative measures , including safer devices , account for about a third of the cost of dealing with sharps injuries . #% Many small businesses have nothing to fear from a risk-sensitive framework because there are many small businesses which are very good risks and which therefore can expect to get cheaper finance as a result of Basel II . #% EU decision-makers should accept that a centralised solution is not always the best solution . #% As things stand , I think we tragically face the likelihood that Europe will be seen as reneging on those principles and on those priorities . #% I should be grateful if you could give me a little more detail on that . #% It is becoming increasingly the case that although a time is set for the vote , it is delayed day after day . #% All the while they do not do so , the European Union is the loser . #% When I bought my first car my primary consideration was to be noticed in it by the opposite sex . #% Mr President , under the Rules of Procedure concerning voting , you have just said that it is the right of every single Member to call for a check . #% This report is the annual debate on racism in the year 2000 . #% 
SMEs currently account for two-thirds of all workers - the majority of all workers employed in the European Union . #% That is my understanding of that compromise . #% I believe that this is fundamentally a credit to the people and indeed to the Government of Bangladesh . #% The goal that we should seek jointly with the Americans is a return to full respect for international law , not a dilution of it . #% I agree with Commissioner Frattini and Mrs in ` t Veld on the need for a coherent EU policy . #% Following that , more detailed orientations were set out in the White Paper on reforming the Commission which was adopted , published and presented to this Parliament on 1 March . #% One of the major issues on the agenda of that conference was spectrum regulation and management , particularly in the context of the so-called digital dividend -- in the phraseology that some will have used this evening -- which relates to the releasing of high-quality radio frequency spectrum as a result of the switchover to digital television . #% I want to comment too on Commissioner Patten 's very welcome statement that he did not see any connection between being European and anti-Americanism . #% As someone who for the last three years has been on the delegation to south-east Europe and more recently a vice-chair , I feel it is essential that we keep up and develop the financial assistance to allow the Balkan countries to aspire to the eventual goal , which must be membership of the European Union . #% This creates a double barrier for those countries and the tourist sectors within those Member States : first of all they lack the convenience of the euro zone and , secondly , they will become out-priced within the single market . #% Our intention is to try to defeat prejudice because it is irrational and frequently brings brutal consequences . #% Mr President , on a point of order under Rule 181 of the Rules of Procedure , I tabled a written declaration under Rule 51 calling for a boycott of Ferrero SpA . #% I thank the Commissioner for his helpful response . #% I have studied Ms Lulling 's amendments and feel that she has made a valiant effort to improve what was originally a heavy-handed report on self-employment . #% We can do far more about this than we are actually doing at the moment . #% How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us ? #% One of those cases is my own constituent Andrew Symeou . #% Mrs Morgan said that she and her group are facing problems head-on . #% I hope that Mr Barroso , when he addresses the parliamentary forum on 9 May , will be able to lay out a comprehensive Commission strategy towards finding a way out of the crisis . #% Mr President , I speak on behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party , which shares many of the aspirations contained in this resolution . #% Where did that come from and why did it come into the European Union ? #% New evidence from scientists in California in just the past few weeks demonstrates that car fumes can actually cause asthma rather than only exacerbating asthma in existing sufferers . #% in writing . - I and my ECR Group colleagues agree with much of this report and we remain wholeheartedly supportive of providing equal rights and opportunities for all people regardless of race , religion , gender or sexual orientation . #% This is an important debate , and I want to endorse the ideas coming out of the two reports , particularly those of Mrs Zabell on doping and also Mrs Lynne 's remarks about the presumption of innocence , because that is important . #% Perhaps , in three or four years ' time , criticism of the Union itself may mean that you no longer conform to the democratic principles of the Union and therefore you are not just denied funding , but possibly even banned . #% If there is , in the view of Parliament -- and certainly in the view of my group -- insufficient progress , we will look towards adopting a further resolution , one which will spell out possible initiatives to be taken by this Parliament in conjunction with national parliaments , and also consequences for our own parliamentary business , because we can not continue with business-as-usual . #% To mark this , I would ask MEP colleagues to follow up in their own countries the question of job discrimination against diabetics . #% Mr President , since that mission to the Côte d'Ivoire by ACP and European Parliament parliamentarians in May 2003 it has become increasingly clear that the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement is a rather imperfect instrument . #% It is not acceptable for the budgetary authorities to be so out of step with previously agreed commitments , but it also demonstrates that we must all face up to some tough choices . #% Actually , there were three brothers and the contributions I have heard tonight lead me to believe that the three brothers Groucho , Chico and Harpo are present . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , recent events have once again reminded us all how important it is that we share information in order to ensure the security of EU citizens . #% The Commission and Council must think again and must listen not only to Parliament but to the people of Europe who are entitled to have transparent and open decision-making and legislation . #% Above all , it is the duty of the government of Israel not to play tricks with a signed agreement . #% We have to look at employability in the context of education and training . #% All of these amendments are admissible and I have had discussions again with the Swedish Presidency to make certain that they are in line . #% Consequently , many are tragically forced into receivership , through no fault of their own . #% What in God 's name has all this to do with the Lisbon Process ? #% I believe an agreement is essential if we want to protect the fundamental rights of the EU . #% Mr President , I have said since the start of this episode that I condemn the use of violence to achieve political ends . #% The dossier presented to Parliament in December in response to our resolution of September 2003 is totally inadequate and conspicuously fails to offer any answer to that central question . #% The Israeli army killed more than 12 Palestinian children last month , but what do they care ? #% We are improving educational standards , encouraging life-long learning and striving to ensure that our schools are on-line . #% We have supported this report today on that basis . #% This , of course , applies only in the field of competence of European Union law , but that is a significant field of competence , and all European legislation henceforth will have to comply with that Charter . #% For example , ten studies quoted by the Council of Europe this year found a remarkable consistency in that 25 % of women have experienced domestic violence and between 6 % and 10 % of women suffer violence in any one year . #% It is therefore our suggestion that a little more time is given to them , a reasonable timescale in which the necessary investment can be made so that these plants can comply . #% So let us cancel Lisbon mark 2 and let national governments and local councils of Member States do the job they were democratically elected to do . #% If we were to use Article 175 it would make marketing of products containing these gases almost impossible across the whole of the European Union . #% Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of my group to express our concern at the recent decision by the Commission to endorse the placing on the market of genetically-modified maize modified by Ciba-Gigy , now known as Novartis . #% These activities are organised in the so-called Pillar 4 which is headed by a Commission official , Mr Dixon . #% The full story is still very confused . #% When things go wrong , there is a need for redress . #% My other point is this : now is the time to consider the harmonization of penalties and their application throughout the whole Community , so that drivers penalized , say , in England , Wales or France are not still able to drive in Germany or Belgium . #% There is little to reassure me about the welfare of my constituents . #% We need to have a debate about how we organise our work . #% As part of the evidence for that , I would suggest one item : it is the way in which I insisted - and my colleagues in the Commission readily accepted - that when Mrs Andreasen 's suspension came she should be suspended on full pay , partly in order to make it absolutely , abundantly clear that the Commission was not in any sense prejudging her case - a case that is still under consideration because of prima facie evidence that she allegedly may have committed serious breaches of staff regulations . #% We are all responsible for our own actions . #% Therefore , I abstain rather than voting for this amendment . #% We only ask that given that we have taken these measures which we believe to be effective , you do not ask to us to take additional measures which have no scientific justification for them . #% I do not know how true they are , but I have heard of : French beef being sold in markets with the spinal tissue and brain still attached - the food agency could look at that ; carcasses not inspected in France by qualified vets , unlike in the UK ; pigs still fed bone marrow - the food agency could look at those cases ; lower standards of farm hygiene in France ; French supermarkets do not insist on seeing pesticide records . #% Yet , Mr Blair , we have had just half a sentence on climate change from you in your speech here today . #% Let us be clear that there will not be any decision in this Parliament about the final nature of this financial perspective . #% author . - Mr President , I should like to say this to the Commissioner : the bank crisis resolution is being elaborated at an international level and there are also important competition issues to address , but this does not mean that everything has to wait , in particular when we have a combined sovereign debt and banking crisis . #% Commission proposals ought perhaps to be subject to proper impact assessments and , similarly , MEP amendments , so that we actually know what we are doing when we legislate in pursuit of this overall aim of competitiveness . #% Our amendments suggest that sections of that second part should be amendable by a simplified procedure - maybe not all of it , that may cause insurmountable problems , but at least part of it . #% We are all living longer , and sport is occupying a greater part of our time . #% 
As a Member of the Constitutional Affairs Committee , speaking on behalf of Lord Inglewood , I must say that it seems very nearly a year is sufficient time for the powers that be to have considered this matter . #% Let us give the green light now to the opening of negotiations with Turkey , not grudgingly , but with enthusiasm . #% Ozone pollution contributes to the premature death of tens of thousands of people each year ; it causes breathing difficulties , coughs , headaches and eye irritation . #% The people will watch as Europhiles submit their nations to another excessive stamp of EU authority . #% Essentially , governments are allowing their public authorities to evade the provisions of the public procurement system . #% Cherry-picking from the constitutional text , at this stage at least , would be unproductive . #% I urge you to support this resolution . #% I do not accept that the EU has any competence or responsibility to determine the content of the school curriculum in the United Kingdom and I reject the idea of any programme of education seeking to advance the false concept of ` European citizenship ' . #% I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage . #% The intention is to advance and promote the political and foreign policy agenda of the European Commission . #% Increasing their scope does not make them any more likely to be imposed . #% We need the European Constitution ; we can not let it be kicked into the long grass for months and years ahead . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I wish to express our very strong support for this current programme of measures to combat unemployment in Europe 's areas of industrial decline . #% On 19 March , the French government replied to initial queries from the European Commission , stating that immediate steps had been taken to carry out new security work at Fréthun and to provide 24-hour police coverage . #% We have achieved something that we can be proud of . #% Much of the violence that took place before the elections can be based directly back to the leadership of Zanu-PF and to President Mugabe himself . #% We do not want to undermine the WTO by having out-of-court settlements between the great and the good . #% The Council has to explain to the House why it made these changes . #% Let me end on a positive note . #% This is important , too , because the Stability and Growth Pact is not a judicial procedure , but a political procedure that relies on the support of the finance ministers for recommendations and , ultimately , sanctions . #% I should particularly like to thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for including a number of amendments which meet the concerns of the charity sector in the European Union and in the United Kingdom as well . #% When looking at the Council and Commission decisions , I see an attempt to rewrite the regulation , in particular references to it in Article 9 of the Commission decision - documents which do not reflect opinions or individual opinions will not be made available . #% The number of days of exceedance could easily be adjusted , but that is something to negotiate only when necessary . #% We asked the Commission to come forward with some proposals to solve the other problem we had identified at that time , which was the hundreds of thousands of small-point sources across the Union in different places , largely associated with the use of paints , but many other issues as well . #% We have had the detail , permitting the adoption of a statute for European political parties since the Treaty of Amsterdam , signed by every Member State , ratified by every national parliament . #% The Committee on Women 's Affairs and Equal Opportunities talks about gender mainstreaming whilst at the same time its very existence contradicts this principle . #% It is not just a call to arms , Mr Flynn , but a call for compassion and a call for action at European level . #% Mr President , following my intervention yesterday concerning photographers equipped with longrange lenses in Parliament , several worried Members asked me who they were photographing . #% A fruit and vegetable wholesaler had his premises raided by police and trading standards officers , who seized the weighing equipment which he used to dispense his produce in the traditional British units of pounds and ounces . #% If it is too early to do that , surely the Council can provide us with some information about how it will properly coordinate this comprehensive strategy - when it comes into existence - across the various Councils . #% We also have the needs of Afghanistan , or perhaps I should say the unknown needs of Afghanistan . #% It is the experience of many charities working in the field that they remain hampered by the failure to enact and implement envisaged legislation which would allow the Government and the charities to enter into contractual relations , thereby permitting the charities to receive matching funds . #% It is clear this business has to be restructured and that it must change in its present form because of the lack of demand for its products . #% Where I need to express a slightly divergent view is in whether our efforts to improve and extend it have been over-expansive . #% What seems very clear is that the market can deliver on some of this but there is a need for clear rules at European level about much of it to make sure that the European industry remains in the forefront of these changes . #% Former senior members of the KGB are willing to testify in such an investigation under the right circumstances . #% There are other issues . #% I share the regret expressed by Mrs Reding and my colleague Mrs Trautmann about what I regarded as the entirely unnecessary disruption of our meetings in a country that clearly has embraced many aspects of the digital revolution , as the previous speaker said . #% The budget headings for the Committee on the Environment generally concern very small amounts but they have enabled us to start the preparatory research that will help us develop the issue of health competence under the Amsterdam Treaty . #% Madam Chairman , I rise on a point of order . #% Everybody knows that food and animal feed have to be safer . #% However , my Group is of the strong view that if , through no fault of its own , the Irish presidency does not begin to produce results within a reasonable period of time , it will not be possible for our Parliament to continue with ` business as usual ' . #% Having heard again your comments , Commissioner , on the Environment Committee 's report , I am afraid I do maintain my view that the Commission 's proposal as it stands is disappointing and weak and simply will not do what it claims to do . #% If he is now rather belatedly accepting our positions , I certainly welcome his conversion . #% But it is nonetheless quite sensible that the two arms of the budgetary authority agree on a multiannual perspective to permit more sensible long-term and forward planning . #% The agricultural sector and the interests of the rural population are important to both the EU and the candidate countries . #% There is no doubt that whilst the Commission has tightened up on personal imports , which I welcome , we are still wide open to the disease entering the EU . #% Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident : they have good management , good prospects and they are good investments . #% Investment and development , democracy and human rights are potentially an important way to support , through soft power in particular , the EU 's wider foreign policy goals and could also contribute to reducing inward migratory pressures on the EU 's external borders . #% Mr President , I wish to make two relatively brief points . #% As soon as we start moving one little bit of the constitution , there will somebody else who wants to remove another bit of it , and the whole thing could fall apart . #% So I welcome his efforts in fighting BSE . #% Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , Madame President and only then , may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union . #% That is important and I agree with his analysis that we should not support the other amendments . #% Not only would it have brought the EU into disrepute again , it would also have been a nightmare for employers and workers alike . #% We do not want to see this abandoned . #% Any standards of transparency and democracy in the world are practised on a strictly limited basis , and the European Union hardly sets an example . #% Not only have they had no problems , but their health and well-being have benefited . #% The Commissioner recognises this and has come forward with an ambitious programme , as our rapporteur has said , but the budget was savaged by two-thirds . #% I know too from discussions - notably with Polish colleagues - how difficult the national context in Poland is and how this has regrettably become a , notably for opposition parties - Poland has a minority government . #% On the issue of a single pan-European supervisor , we have some divergence of views within our group . #% In the debate I called for safety for the detained Ogoni human rights activist Batom Mitee , brother of the acting president of their movement . #% Let us have a new European treaty and let us put it to a referendum in lots of countries , particularly in Britain , and the British people will conclude that this is a very bad deal for Britain . #% I believe it is right to call this regime part of the axis of evil . #% We should condemn Pinochet with a single and united voice , and I hope the Conservatives and Christian Democrats will examine their consciences before they decide to do otherwise . #% I want to thank the Court for its work in producing these extra reports on the new satellite agencies , covering their beginnings sometime in 1994 and then 1995 . #% 
Mr President , the voters of France and Holland have denied power to those they no longer trust , as indeed we would have done in the UK had we had the chance . #% Mr President , as a co-author of this resolution I am proud that I spoke out in June of this year in this Chamber against the brutality and medieval obscurantist policies of the Taliban government , when they chose to destroy the beautiful Buddhist statutes in Bamiyan . #% Mr President , congratulations to the European Commission for making the programme for action against communicable diseases with its legal base in this area a priority . #% I agree very much with Mr Chichester 's comments on the cost-benefit analysis . #% The British Government is not asking for dates , it is not asking for anything to be taken on trust ; it is asking merely for the establishment of a framework . #% I do not believe this is a persuasive argument . #% There is a good suggested list here in Austria 's draft paper , but it is simply not comprehensive enough . #% All of these points are of course made in very clear terms in the White Paper , which is , as some Members have reminded us , to be considered in this House tomorrow . #% Please make this resolution on arms exports a resolution that is worthy of this Parliament . #% Mr President , also on the question of the security of the House , you will recall that on 28 November 2000 , the Turkish Foreign Minister addressed the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy of this House and he was interrupted by demonstrators . #% Many of them have contributed much to our countries ' development and to providing increased wealth and prosperity . #% Mr President , I am sure across this House , and between Parliament , the Commission and the Council , we all agree education is important . #% We support his proposal to reduce the additional bureaucratic processes required in adapting to the new system and thus ensuring compliance with GATT requirements . #% Madam President , first of all could I put on record my thanks to Mr Bowe who was the budget rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment for the first half of the mandate . #% She has been the victim of what is in effect a struggle between a reactionary judiciary and a state that is trying to reform . #% I hope the Commission proposals and Parliament 's response are seen by those in the railway industry as an honest attempt to ensure that Europe 's railway industry has a future . #% This new form of government simply does not work ! #% We also have to start speaking the truth . #% In their case I really believe that duality should continue . #% I know Pakistan reasonably well and by far the biggest issue and problem facing Pakistan internally today is the terrorist threat coming from across the border in Afghanistan . #% We are tired of coming on to stage when the main action has taken place to lament or celebrate what has happened and to offer philosophical reflections on the sad state of mankind - '' Ïßìïé ç ôÜëáéíá '' indeed ! #% Some set-aside land is very effective for environmental enhancement , but I think we should look very positively at using other set-aside land for fuel . #% What is needed is a new international investment agreement under the auspices of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development . #% It is unique also for us as the EU to have a positive relationship with Russia there , through the Northern Dimension . #% I voted against Amendment 51 from my own group to paragraph 50 of Mr Eurlings ' report on Turkey 's progress towards accession . #% I will deal with the easier one first , the eTEN programme , which the Commissioner has outlined with admirable clarity . #% The ombudsman system , for example , could be expanded . #% Mr President , this measure is of great significance in those countries - the United Kingdom , Ireland and Sweden - which are now bringing their rules on the movement of pet animals into line with practices elsewhere in the Community . #% And finally , can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter ' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development . #% It is the best poverty index so let us use it . #% But maybe we need a fallback position ? #% That is why I particularly welcome the presidency programme on justice and home affairs . #% Simply having a good website may not be the answer . #% This must primarily be a matter for each Member State to decide . #% In the past the British Conservatives ' double standards have brought the United Kingdom ' s House of Commons into disrepute , and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament . #% First of all , they need to be implemented in a balanced way which takes account of competitiveness and of security of supply . #% Sex workers should have access to affordable legal advice so as to increase the conviction rate . #% However , this has not reached the compromise resolution , so we wish now to put down a clear marker for the future about how this process should be conducted . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the Laperrouze report on the Second Strategic Energy Review despite ( for me ) its over-enthusiasm for nuclear energy . #% I was pleased to see there are some references to digital radio in this report , but not enough . #% Yet nine years after this directive was first discussed , when the disability movement for a generation has put accessible public transport at the heart of its demands , those on the opposite side of the House threaten to vote , not simply against the amendment , but to destroy the whole directive . #% However , in reality it is between France and Germany and 19 other pro-US new European governments . #% The European Parliament should condemn the Nigerian government for its announcement this month that it is seeking to resume oil operations in Ogoniland by force . #% We would ask the Commission to use his best wiles and skills as a politician as well as a Commissioner to seek dégagement for those staff who are currently unhappy with the false move to Thessaloniki . #% I suspect this is the sort of issue which is not limited to owners coming from the United Kingdom but to those from other countries too and we do not want it to be seen as yet another grievance . #% This liner , built in France , will sail from England , showing there is some life left in the . #% There is still going to be a problem with harvest time , but most of industry can cope with this apart from the agriculture sector . #% We are interested to know whether the Council and Commission are happy with the absorption rate being shown for funds at the moment . #% First of all , the United States of America is a democratic country which twice in the last century was prepared to lay down the lives of its citizens to defend peace , freedom and democracy in Europe . #% Mr President , I very much welcome this legislation which , I think , will help clean up our environment . #% I would also endorse Amendment No 59 which states that all players must be involved and spells out who those players are . #% We now need to set a new course for our economies . #% My group believes that the discipline of candidate status will involve Turkey in more serious preparation for membership , a stronger dialogue and greater exposure to European Union culture and politics . #% We can see that education will deliver , it will stimulate the economy , it will offer opportunities to control population and increase health awareness . #% I have no difficulty at all in supporting this particular compromise because it allows the development of the single market in such things as vehicle spare parts but at the same time it does not inhibit the development of design protection in those areas which need it . #% The second point , which is a difficult one , is that in many cases defence procurement agreements also have some form of offset agreement attached to them . #% For Europe he has been the right man in the right place at the right time and we all wish him well in leaving the European Monetary Institute presidency . #% For instance , despite eight directives on value-added tax so far , the administration of VAT remains as complex as ever and fraud is now running into billions . #% We are also aware that certain governments do not want to see any extension of parliamentary powers in the convention process . #% I certainly am . #% There were two -- only in Bamako -- and they could not afford the drugs or the insulin , so the result was amputations and blindness , liver disease and early deaths . #% There are also doubts about making such a change in circumstances where there is increasing agreement that a variety of measures are needed to reduce fishing effort . #% That is why we are asking the Commission to monitor these aspects of implementation in future reports . #% I would also like to thank the Commission and its staff , and the Council , for their work . #% However , I am unsure as to why we have singled out Malaysia here . #% We will have an opportunity to discuss the matter further at that time . #% 
We have exercised the purchase option before the date of 31 May and in so doing we have managed to get the beneficial input to Parliament 's budget of the BEF 7.25 billion that has been negotiated between Parliament and the Kingdom of Belgium . #% I remember , as the member of a local authority , seeing a council waste time , effort and money trying to unscramble a valuable school meals contract that proved to be totally unsatisfactory . #% If that happened to one , two or three jumbo jets each and every week , those particular aircraft simply would not fly ; we would not tolerate it . #% But you dare not do that to the British people because , when they are told the plain unvarnished truth , they will vote with their feet , right out of the EU , taking their annual EU contributions of EUR 18 billion of their own taxpayers ' money with them . #% I would like to thank colleagues from the Austrian Presidency who have agreed with us an enhanced role for Parliament , as the Council prepares its annual human rights report on behalf of the Union as a whole . #% British taxpayers deserve to have value for money . #% We are , however , concerned that the practical problems may delay the implementation . #% With our chairman Mr Gemelli we are now looking at ways of making the Petitions Committee more effective and more efficient in the work it does on behalf of citizens . #% I would like to see whether there are differences in the pattern of the school day , whether this varies in different parts of Europe , and whether this offers ways of improving education . #% The most important requirement for us on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is that those areas which are heavily dependent on coal and steel production should not lose the advantages and benefits that currently ensue from the current ECSC Treaty and that Europe should continue to aid those areas in restructuring their local economies at a time when coalmines are being closed and there is an over-capacity of steel production in the world . #% This has the potential to be a far-reaching and radical piece of European legislation and in consultation with other non-EU states it can go a long way towards resolving the problems of maritime pollution caused by oil and hazardous or noxious substances . #% This report is about a level playing field : not to charge more but to charge more efficiently . #% Why has there been no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ? #% Nearer to home , we are affected , at the moment by the lack of a common working asylum system for Europe and the separate issue of a common immigration policy , which will come later . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr Barroso , the recent WikiLeaks storm has led to mixed feelings , with some people saying transparency is good and others saying perhaps the leaks will damage international diplomacy . #% Digitalization marks the dawn of a new age . #% As they say , Rome was not built in a day . #% Those people who are in favour of building Europe should not be surprised that the public treat it with great scepticism . #% I will pose the question here that I posed in Committee : what value should we place upon whether a person in their 40s or 50s can actually hear and communicate with their infant grandchildren ? #% Also , of course , we must look for a continuation of the human rights dialogue . #% Yes , I say to the State of Israel that I am not entirely convinced that the action which it has taken these past few weeks will succeed in the object which it sets itself , because I fear it may have created more people who want to engage in suicide missions . #% We spent a very long time voting on this . #% That means that a fundamental reform of fisheries policy is essential . #% I would also like to say quite clearly , as other speakers have done , that importing wild birds into the European Union at the moment is crazy and needs to be stopped , at least for the time being , because there is no point in bringing in disease . #% One can only hope that it is now in the past , and there is a statement in the report which welcomes the actions taken by the Secretary-General to make sure that this type of thing will never happen again . #% The Champions League and the G14 clubs across the UK , Spain and Italy , oppose the EU intervention in football broadcasting rights . #% Secondly , would he comment on what the legal basis would be for the possibility of an extension to the transitional arrangements ? #% Would the President-in-Office agree with me that if the Council were to set these clear benchmarks , which we have laid out in our resolution , then we would avoid risking acquiescence in the process which Abacha is so clearly engaged in and that will result in a civilian glove covering the military fist that Abacha has applied for so long ? #% EU funding has been instrumental in generating a robust pipeline of innovative TB vaccine candidates , as the Commission said enabling their early stage development by phase 1 and phase 2A clinical trials . #% Is the public health of the EU overridden by the trade interests of EU exporters ? #% That can not be a bad thing in terms of the recognition of the ability of this Parliament to achieve a high level of environmental protection for the people of Europe . #% I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog . #% The ninth EDF included funds left over from the previous EDF : ` unspent money ' . #% I would ask your services to look at this and ensure that this question at least receives a written answer so that this man does not have his job threatened and is not forced to go back to Kosovo where he would be in danger of losing his life . #% But when it comes to human rights abuses , if we are selective in the application of principle , then we lay this House open to the charge of hypocrisy . #% The DPRK can not pursue a policy of ignoring the collective will of the United Nations and must cease its nuclear proliferation immediately . #% Obviously the international community can not ignore such deliberate defiance . #% But in the interests of time , I will pass that by . #% Over 3 million animals every year endure journeys lasting 30 hours or more in unacceptable conditions and many die in transit . #% Since then , the EU 's Charter of Fundamental Rights - and I believe its Articles 12 and 21 - have come into force , further guaranteeing in law citizens ' freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation at EU institutional level . #% Monetary policy can , within the spirit of Article 105 of the Treaty , contribute in a substantial manner to the achievement of Community objectives as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty . #% Mr President , the first EU-Africa summit was an important event and had a great deal of potential for taking meaningful steps to reduce the marginalisation of African countries . #% We believe that we need a screening exercise of the Commission by 30 April 2007 so that we can understand what the mid-term demands of the Commission are before taking radical action to cut back . #% It is very important that we maintain the closest links , as the previous speaker mentioned . #% Iraq is a country that is riven by tragedy : it is fraught with trauma , and the pain of its people stretches across the world . #% The second aspect is to change the methods so that fishermen are still going out , catching their tuna , but using different methods of doing so , which do not have the by-catch consequences that driftnets have . #% A truly liberalising services directive would be the most fundamental sign of Europe reforming , which it desperately needs to do now and not at some vague date in the future . #% I hope the Commission will take such points into serious consideration when developing policy in the area . #% This is one of the causes and consequences of social exclusion . #% The emphasis on money laundering and crime is only part of the issue . #% This happened recently in a landmark speech by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , Gordon Brown , who , as we all know , called for the repatriation of regional aid . #% By the same token , that should apply to Moldova and , one day , to Belarus , if it becomes a democratic country . #% Let us not forget that a codecision agreement is still needed and that the Council will also have to agree to that figure . #% Equally , as announced in the voting list and for the sake of clarity and coherence of the text that we have now adopted , I kindly ask that you request the plenary services to proceed , without any substantive change , to do the following : to group the articles according to their content under specific thematic titles , to re-order recitals and definitions accordingly and to produce and publish Parliament 's position as a consolidated text as soon as possible . #% The cost and time to them may be prohibitive , and if items go off the market , then it is the consumer who will suffer . #% The patchwork that we have at the moment is not good enough . #% Is the Commission aware of the fact that the world Chocolate Manufacturers Association concluded an agreement back in 2001 specifically to deal with this issue ? #% According to an article in the Italian newspaper l'Unità , on 7 December 2005 Condoleezza Rice had frank discussions with EU ministers at a dinner at which the issue of extraordinary renditions was discussed . #% The present government of Bangladesh , the Awami League Government , has , to its great credit , sought to achieve a peace agreement and the seventh round of the talks on this is set for 26 November . #% We need to have a full debate in this House from all sides of the political spectrum . #% Also , of course , we shall continue to need timber for all the other uses to which it is put , such as in construction and other possible new uses . #% In these circumstances , the position of the prosecutor that her job is not to safeguard the public from known dangers is inexplicable . #% Criminals have their fingerprints taken and we need not automatically or in any way assume that asylum seekers ought to be put into this category . #% On the reverse journey that will switch , so ferries operating between the UK and the Netherlands will have to charge six different prices for goods on a single return journey . #% We must take this opportunity now to ensure that does not continue , and we must get a specific disability directive . #% I should like to wish you well for the future . #% 
I have to say that the British Labour Members will vote against the exclusion of waste incineration from the definition of renewables , on the understanding that this refers to material which can not be recycled . #% When we talk about rural areas , it does not necessarily mean that we are talking about agriculture as a form of industry and employment . #% Commissioner , before you disappear : I am grateful for much of your answer but I asked you a specific question . #% The problem we faced there was determining how much of the chemical gets into people 's bodies . #% Our policy must be twin-track , and I use that word advisedly : it is in the guidance that the Commission has produced . #% It is not simply a question of supporting ad hoc disarmament , demobilisation and reconstruction programmes as part of our crisis management response , we have to mainstream this into broader development assistance programmes and include it in our political dialogue with all other countries and regions worldwide . #% Is this allowed under our Rules ? #% All G7 countries have promised some form of 100 % debt cancellation , but many of them are very slow and disinclined to do it in the way that we would like . #% I ask Member States to proscribe this terrorist organisation and to help build peace and stability in Sri Lanka and strongly support the initiative currently being taken by the Norwegian and Indian governments . #% Mr President , I wanted to pick up on a couple of the points raised by Mr Prodi and by the Greek Presidency . #% After 11 long years in which the EU 's accounts have been rejected by its own auditors , this weak-kneed attempt to change the system seems to me like pouring huge amounts of gold dust through a sieve , thinking ` oh , perhaps we better try and stuff up a few of the holes ' . #% Let us name and shame at every opportunity and bring the public alongside us in ensuring that this environmental legislation is enforced and that Member States recognise their responsibilities . #% It will then be in the hands of you legislators and the legislators in the Council to decide the speed of passage and - I hope - the early date of implementation of this and other necessary changes . #% When will the industry learn that in order to maintain public confidence and support and to have any hope of operating in future they must operate to the highest safety standards with a diligence and zeal second to none ? #% Secondly , there is a drought in the country and it is feared that there could be a severe shortage of food in a few months ' time . #% It is in the interests of the people of Europe that we have an efficient and affordable postal service that reflects the fact that postal communications are an essential public service . #% Finally , we must have proper democratic control . #% However , I agree with Mr Verde that it was better to progress this directive as quickly as possible . #% Perhaps he would make a personal comment about the operation of Directive No 1475 that has already been passed . #% Is the Luxembourg Compromise still regarded as being in force and being respected and would you not agree that it should be ? #% She achieved this position totally on her own merit and in open competition against all-comers . #% Obviously , I would like to see it exceeded because there are a large number of highly capable women , as Mrs Dybkjær pointed out to us , in the Commission , and we want to see that quality properly recognised . #% It is only unfortunate that we are doing it on a Thursday afternoon when it is not quite as well attended as perhaps it should be . #% Secondly , EUR 5 million in commitments and payments is added to line 16 02 02 : ` Multimedia actions ' . #% At that gate I found other colleagues , including Mr Hume , who got the Nobel Peace Prize for dealing with the hard men of Ireland - but they are nothing compared to the ground staff at Paris Charles de Gaulle . #% For over a year now , diplomatic and military staff energy has been wastefully expended on negotiating EU access to NATO resources . #% It is people , as you have already said , that distinguish the Arctic from the Antarctic . #% When I was in Hong Kong a number of people observed to me that people involved in cases of litigation were asking for postponement of their cases to after 1 July , implying that they might be getting special favours after that date . #% I thank Mr Maat very much for that . #% Let us not begin to rewrite history and change what we learnt the hard way , nor alter our views . #% Article 276 ( 3 ) of the Treaty requires the Commission to take all appropriate steps to act on Parliament ' s observations concerning execution of expenditure . #% Compromises , by definition , do not satisfy everyone and we would say that the joint resolution is all right up to a point but we shall be tabling a number of amendments to it . #% Madam President , for nearly half a century Colombia has been afflicted by violence and vicious killings on an horrific scale . #% In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started , together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously , of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States . #% With the threat of nuclear developments in Iran hanging over the region , steps must be taken now to demonstrate that respect for international law is alive and well in the Middle East . #% That is the change that is needed . #% I was recently at meetings in both Daventry and Brixworth in my region , where concern was expressed that the budget is not spent or implemented properly . #% There they bind together the approaches necessary for a single market to emerge . #% There is so much criticism of migrants who fail to integrate , but little is done to assist them through , for example , family reunification or rights of free movement . #% I am painfully aware of the fact that one of the first attempts to set standards for early satellite broadcasting came adrift because the most powerful broadcasters in the field at the time - and they are still there today , but stronger and more powerful - deliberately decided to bypass these standards and to go their own way . #% Finally , in relation to the presidency of the European Central Bank , the Socialist Group expects that this weekend a president for the European Central Bank and an executive board will be nominated . #% That would end pressure on the agenda right at the end of this evening . #% We in the European Parliament and the EU as a whole must do all we can to support the moves towards democracy . #% Lo and behold , in 1998 , this was then shifted back to Mrs Cresson without any formal Commission decision - it was just decided as a game between the cabinets . #% There is a high degree of collusion , as others have said , in terms of one Group calling for split votes on all the others ' amendments and that Group calling for split votes on all their colleagues ' amendments . #% Severe shortages and over-dependency on petrol and coal are driving up costs and pollution . #% It should please us all that SMEs , which have been the scene of some of the worst accidents , are receiving special attention . #% We are told today by the Council that safeguarding human rights is a priority for EU governments . #% So what has the EU done to bring this about ? #% The appointment of Mr Kinnock and Mr Patten clearly underlines the impression that appointment to the Commission is in effect a consolation prize to compensate for political rejection in one ' s own country . #% We look forward to seeing a progressive solution being found in the Council in its response to the European Parliament 's vote on the Santini report . #% The danger is that a majority in Parliament feels bound to support everything that the Commission it has elected wants to do - just as many of our national parliaments feel bound to support their executive , come what may . #% There need to be clear criteria of independence and autonomy and proper resourcing which we need to really push upon the Member States , and not be swayed by their slightly misleading claims that it is all to do with subsidiarity and therefore none of our business . #% The purpose of this debate is to highlight what is going wrong and to try and do something about it . #% What particularly impressed me about the Commissioner 's remarks was that he said that the status quo is not an option . #% This will give rise to endless argument and is not a sound basis for a legal definition . #% In Amendment No 13 we propose annual medical checks for cabin crew . #% Indeed , he will be introducing proposals along those lines very shortly and they will be welcome . #% Madam President , Mr Katiforis is quite correct , but if the precedent in this House , is anything to go by , now that Parliament has made a proposal , in five years ' time the Commission will come forward with an idea which we will reject again . #% The staggering success of this agency has far outstripped every expectation . #% The Norwegian Government has recently produced a very full policy document for discussion on the High North . #% But more worryingly , under the Jean Monnet programme I see the orthodoxies of the European Union now being taught in political science and in European history courses . #% Furthermore , it has to be said that , within the context of the Treaties , the function of this Parliament is to scrutinise the Commission . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report , which follows a huge number of petitions to Parliament by victims and concerned citizens from across Europe . #% As I have tried to stress , the overriding issue is safety , and not only the safety of the drivers of the lorries and coaches but of the people carried in those coaches and of all other road users . #% Without being able to out-vote troublesome and perhaps greedy Member States , the Union will be obliged to have protracted and public rows ending in costly concessions . #% 
I hope Parliament does the sensible thing , which is to vote in favour of the data retention proposals . #% In far too many cases they are just preying on poor people in developing countries . #% The ultimate delivery of these services will have to come from the marketplace . #% We do not accept the criticisms and overall content of this paragraph . #% Let us stick to delivering what we agreed to deliver . #% To do this , it is a small price we pay to have a permanent EU Operational Military HQ ready for such a future eventuality . #% What particular positive developments in China have prompted this action ? #% However , we are concerned that there are continued attempts to facilitate the rapid adoption of the EU Constitution and implement legislation for an `` Area of Freedom , Security and Justice '' which we do not support . #% The Stability Pact is rather like the common fisheries policy : every country has an interest in other countries keeping to the rules but in not being restricted itself . #% To be meaningful the precautionary principle should be invoked only when there is a clear and demonstrable risk . #% My last question on close cooperation would include Commissioner Patten , if he is able to demonstrate that he has not imposed a vow of silence . #% First of all awareness campaigns : these are something that Member States could actually do without too much difficulty . #% The building of a professional and reliable Afghan army and police force , which is happening in parallel largely under American , British and French auspices , will take time and there seems little doubt that ISAF will have to continue its operations next year and an early indication of the follow-on command arrangements is needed . #% Yet the US and others are still in denial , firstly about Israel 's massive nuclear weapons capacity that underpins Iran 's drive to become a nuclear weapons power . #% I fear though that the size of the podium in this chamber will require strengthening and extension so that it can fit in Valerie Giscard d' Estaing and his entourage . #% We should perhaps look at a form of insurance with the Member State and the European Union as the insurer of last resort , so that they can actually step in when there are huge disasters . #% Mr President , this is a very important issue because this is discrimination which faces all women , not only in the EU , but across the world . #% Last week the US Supreme Court started a case against the military commissions , looking into the matter . #% Graphically displayed on TV , boatloads of West Africans were seen trying to make their way across the Atlantic , their misery compounded as dozens died when their inshore craft could not cope with the open sea . #% I am equally sure that these regulations can not have been intended to apply to them with the same rigour as to fully-fledged airlines . #% I look forward to reading the communication . #% This is going to become more and more important as we get more information-technology driven solutions , more horizontal team-working of the type that I know is moving into areas like the information society . #% in writing . - I welcome Caroline Lucas 's report laying down certain obligations on operators who place timber and timber products on the market . #% I would like to concentrate on the role of parliaments . #% We are merely signalling a political direction but it is important that we should signal a legally certain and workable solution , not one that will create as many problems as it seeks to solve . #% He should visit the so-called region that I represent . #% The strain on the Europeans will be greater . #% So rather than restricting ourselves to a one-month deadline in the Rules generally , when you can go further for that category , the Rule is being adapted to ensure that we can go further for measures of that kind . #% According to the World Bank , this increases aid effectiveness by between 12 and 20 per cent . #% We in the British Conservative delegation reluctantly took the decision that we were unable to support the recommendations in the Cunha report . #% Expertise rests in countries such as the United Kingdom and Spain . #% The Agency Workers ' Directive is yet another ill-thought-out and inappropriate EU directive which has yet again disproportionately and adversely affected the UK , which has a third of all EU agency workers . #% Galileo is dependent on revenue and , if it offers no added value , then no one will pay to use it . #% I like to think , at least in part , that this is a compliment to our free and diverse society , but we can not just have an open door , and maybe the French authorities need to reflect on whether their system could be improved . #% But I believe that those of us in this House should remember that when we ask the Commission to apply codes of conduct to high-level officials , to the way in which Commissioners run their offices and so on , we should not ask the Commission to apply standards that we ourselves refuse to apply . #% I should like just to address one particular subject , which is the issue of what has happened to the initiatives that Parliament took under Article 192 of the EC Treaty . #% However , does the Council accept that it will be regarded as an acid test whether the European Union is prepared to stand by poor producers in developing countries , in particular the Caribbean where they have no effective alternative means of livelihood , or give in to United States pressure on behalf of the large multinational companies who already control most of the market and have used their wealth to lobby major American parties ? #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to welcome this report and thank the rapporteur for the immense amount of work he has done . #% Mr President , President Lincoln said you can fool some of the people all the time , all the people some of the time , but you can not fool all the people all the time . #% Mr President , I would like to concentrate purely on the issue of sanitation and I apologise to the Commissioner for not giving her advance notice of some questions I wish to pose . #% You went on to say that you would investigate ways of ensuring that there would be no recurrence . #% Mr President , I should like to make two brief points which may well be relevant should this go to conciliation , as I suspect it will . #% Fifthly , the role of the European Union Monitoring Centre in assisting the Commission in monitoring the implementation of this directive - and I hope the Commission will welcome that . #% Six of the seven EU accession states which are candidates to NATO have not obtained a waiver and have had military aid cut off . #% All the institutions in the European Union want the laws enforced properly . #% I am sure he will not be embarrassed if I share with colleagues just one paragraph which is very pertinent to our topic of discussion today : #% Mr President , I make no apology to Mr Monti that this oral question is in fact a continuing series of questions because many questions still remain to be answered . #% The complaints of the three British men , Nesbitt , Nawaz and Pankhurst , who have made serious allegations of abuse , have yet to be investigated . #% The political declaration from the Commission is important and it shows an open-mindedness faced with the evidence , which we would obviously expect . #% Mr President , I congratulate Stephen Hughes on his report . #% I heard the minister refer to a common position . #% It would demonstrate a great lack of awareness of the problems that disabled people face if we do not give them some degree of respect by scheduling this debate at a time when Members will be present to debate and vote on this important issue . #% Concerning the report of the European Investment Bank , I would include support for tourism and agriculture . #% They must be tackled if the strategy is to come into reality and provide benefits , jobs and a boost to our economy . #% Indeed I believe the Commission is committed to such a review . #% However , I am glad that the Foreign Ministers agreed that there would be no Constitutional cherry-picking while the debate goes on . #% Morgan Tsvangirai -- the leader of the opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change -- has been put on trial under spurious charges of treason . #% The fine elements of this - the technical detail that the car or component manufacturers are advising us about - really ought to be handled by him before it comes to us . #% However , for as long as the EU is the competent authority , help for redundant workers must , apparently , come from this fund . #% I would also like to thank Mr Medina Ortega for reflecting in his report the many views that were put forward by members of the committee , many of which we have heard repeated ad infinitum during the course of the day . #% I personally also want to see a Europe of real reform , because without reform there can be no results . #% Tax harmonisation is a concept dreamed up by the modern political class to make sure that no government steals too little from its people : a sort of thieves ' cartel if you will . #% Mr President , I am grateful for the opportunity to speak for the Committee on Petitions . #% I have made a study of the nuclear aspects of accession . #% It is only covered by proposals under Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty . #% This report sets out some key principles that we trust will be taken on board in the process . #% 
The key problem is capital flight , whether it is legal capital flight or illegal capital flight . #% I would have thought that he would have had a minute to share with us . #% Parliament would like a clear date for action on this . #% No doubt we will be able to return to this at a later stage . #% We look forward to the Commission coming back with plans to bring other greenhouse gases into the scheme and to extend its scope to include other industries . #% That has now been postponed to 12.05 and again to 12.10 . #% Increased trade and prosperity means a reduction in migration , a more stable society and peace . #% This country is in a tragic mess and my Group , the PPE-DE , calls upon the new Barroso Commission , confirmed in office today , to demonstrate its commitment to democracy and human rights in Africa by invoking the procedures under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement and to see what further actions need to be taken to restore the rule of law and freedom to this country . #% We in the European Union could provide support and call upon the international community to provide support for the refugees now numbering hundreds of thousands , I understand , in neighbouring countries such as Syria and Jordan . #% Will you , Mr President , send this Parliament 's greetings and best wishes ? #% Enlargement will make a complex system of coordination even more complex and it is not surprising that many citizens simply do not believe that the Union takes the free movement of citizens as seriously as it takes its commitment to the free movement of goods . #% If some of the contractors feel he acted too precipitately , then they have their civil court rights . #% Mr President , the countries of Central America which were devastated by hurricane Mitch were already seriously afflicted by the aftermath of years of civil war . #% North Korea remains a failing , rogue state and a very dangerous one at that . #% This is a real test of that . #% Finally this has begun to change in a positive way to recognise that farming is only a minority , if important part , of the rural economy . #% That is no surprise , for the rapporteur 's own website has a whole section devoted to the Constitution , including a table of key dates . #% Twenty years ago a British TV documentary similarly recounted a story of a Saudi princess who was publicly executed for adultery . #% The transportation of meat should be in carcass form and not ` on the hoof ' where animals can and do suffer very greatly . #% Mr President , as I hope everyone in this House knows , EUR 5 million went missing at Eurostat . #% Administratively convenient it may be , democracy it is not . #% They are from a local butcher and farmer who lives next door to me , who will almost certainly not be in business by the end of the week . #% Mr President , I do not need to go over the issues which have been very succinctly summarised by Mr Patten in particular - except I would re-emphasise the danger that this action by the Senate may give the wrong message to the hawks in the Russian Duma who have so far failed to respond to nuclear disarmament initiatives . #% We need clear criteria , which is why we support the rapporteur . #% The package borrows cleverly from the Swiss model of the system of government and the Belgian model for European relations . #% I would like to hear the Council say something about what it feels is the future of the European Conference . #% It is very clearly stated in the Cotonou Agreement that alternatives are part of what the ACP countries have an option on deciding to follow . #% The second crucial change from Lomé concerns civil society participation . #% We are very grateful to the Commission for the compensation and the added intervention and support measures which I hope have been agreed . #% I welcome Amendment No 6 to Article 2 ( e ) ( a ) ( new ) about the need to encourage the export of renewable energy technologies from the European Union and to encourage the European Renewable Energies Export Council . #% While others may have the biggest rockets , the EU has the deepest pockets . #% The safeguards and the amendments that we are asking for are designed to ensure that any data collected is processed properly and that where people are granted asylum or achieve legitimate status the data collected is deleted . #% I should also like to join with colleagues in expressing my deep concern about the mass detentions that took place in August , including that of Fathimath Nisreen , a 23-year-old woman who was originally arrested without warrant in February 2002 . #% If the US spent just a fraction of the resources it currently spends on missile defence on defending itself against climate change instead , the world would be a much safer place . #% This is arguably the most successful European institution , and yet we are criticised and we very rarely defend ourselves . #% I would like to press the Commissioner further . #% This war is morally and politically justifiable and its legality is vested in current UN Security Council Resolutions 678 , 687 and 1441 . #% The first is the colleague who expressed concern that we will end up with a concentration of power in very few utilities . #% It paints a very worrying picture . #% Secondly , I want to mention that the Court of Auditors was critical of the lack of controls in joint managed programmes . #% We would like to ensure that this reform is completed by the end of our mandate . #% The third example is that of our new ` baby ' , the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , which is being set up in Stockholm . #% I make the point , Mr President , as I did yesterday in the Budgets Committee , in the twelve years of the financial perspective there have been 38 revisions totalling over EUR 7 000 billion of monies that have been involved in those revisions . #% Although it may at first appear to be a minor technical matter , the millennium bug has in fact the potential to bring the everyday life of millions of people to a grinding halt - if not worse . #% Parliament is not in opposition to other institutions , it is a balance and it is a brake . #% I hear that the average delay is said to be 20 minutes . #% The Watson report demands such rights for family reunion and the Boumediene-Thiery report for freedom of movement and residence , even for third-country nationals and even for convicted criminals . #% We should be exercised about the seaworthiness of seagoing vessels . #% Yet the Commission is proposing that we should appoint an assistant on the basis of someone who manages 1 000 staff in the European Court of Justice - now that does not make sense . #% Small businesses have been allowed too little time to submit the required safety dossier on their products . #% He could have quoted a number of other clichés , but they are only clichés because they are true . #% Just five years ago , the EU set out to make itself a rival to the United States of America within ten years . #% I hope that monies will be directed towards ensuring that . #% I was particularly pleased also that my amendment regarding the use of cage beds in psychiatric institutions and social care homes was passed , and that it was recognised that this was in contravention of all international standards regarding the care of people with mental health problems and/or intellectual disabilities . #% In the immediate future , in Seville , the Council will be facing changes that can be made within the framework of the existing Treaties . #% I hope that this report will be strongly supported tomorrow and that the Members of the Rada will see in its adoption an emphatic endorsement of their wish for ever-closer relations with the European Union . #% Here we are again debating violent unrest in the territory and once again Australia , New Zealand , Portugal and Malaysia have had to intervene to establish law and order in what is now a sovereign State . #% Mr President , it is very regrettable that this common position , which has been put together with such care by the Council and which paid due respect to the Parliament 's views at first reading , is now in the process of unravelling . #% The problem lies there : Member States are not implementing the guidelines properly . #% Pension firms and Member States do not need this report ; they need help to keep premiums down . #% in writing . - I voted for this report as it makes important calls on the Commission to strengthen its monitoring role in order to reduce the error rate highlighted in the recent report by the Court of Auditors . #% That lie is that Britain 's national interest lies in something called a European common foreign policy . #% I hope that the European Commission has the courage to go into the conciliation process arm in arm with the Parliament against , and it will be against , the Council . #% We have proposed in our budget suggestion for next year that it should receive EUR 5 million . #% My concern is that there is a large market in Europe for bushmeat . #% The call to increase the EU 's fund for job creation comes at a time when the EU is attempting to coordinate its employment strategies by the so-called open method of coordination . #% 
We have consistently backed proposals to ensure that the use of GMOs and products derived from GMOs are strictly controlled within the EU . #% On `` better '' I urge Commission and Council to look closely at the call of this Parliament for a uniform and compulsory code of good administrative behaviour . #% Mr President , is it in order for me to put a supplementary question to the President-in-Office following the questions raised by Ms Ahern and Mrs Morgantini ? #% In this inquiry we have heard from victims sent from pillar to post . #% When the military is directly linked to threats , deaths and disappearances , how can BP come to an $ 11.6 m voluntary agreement of collaboration with those same commanders ? #% Council Conclusions of December 2005 reaffirm this , calling for ` specific action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation if no such action is agreed within the ICAO by 2002 ' . #% This was a direct result of the European arrest warrant ; previously it could have taken years . #% They are making an increased effort . #% Finally , I urge us to work with the media , work with politicians who are looking to liberalise Turkey and work with lawyers and members of the judiciary to improve standards in Turkey as a means of developing greater political dialogue . #% Who can stand for election in the Ivory Coast ? #% These were rather difficult cases for us to consider , but that was the final recommendation of the committee . #% At the first stage , the need for the inclusion of a reference to the law applicable should become a component of the contract documentation . #% Until I can be assured of that , I can only support the rapporteur 's opinion that these procedures should not be permitted until we have clear and transparent controls over the way in which they are applied . #% From the health promotion point of view , we want to see the encouragement of sporting activity and sporting excellence . #% We have two lines on the plight of 150 million migrant workers -- more than 10 % of China 's population , one sentence on free trade unions and yet there are five paragraphs on a religious minority that is a hundred times smaller . #% It is not unrealistic , therefore , to suggest that burglars will be able to roam free because police management , under pressure from national authorities , is more concerned with satisfying Community requirements . #% Mr President , as colleagues know , today across Europe there is popular discontent with regard to Europe 's apparent disconnection from ordinary life . #% I hope you will take that message back . #% Finally , with safety so much at stake , we hope that the rules will become accepted as setting minimum standards to improve upon , rather than maximum ones to adhere to simply because that is what the law demands . #% We need a strong , competitive European defence industry . #% Mr President , to some extent I feel that the wonderful camel of the Constitution has now approached the eye of the needle . #% I welcome the linkage of support with the environmental benefits that will flow from it . #% If you , on our behalf , could congratulate them both , I and many others would be very grateful . #% Perhaps it was the one contained in the proposed European Constitution so roundly rejected by the French and Dutch in last year 's referendums , and which would be rejected by the British , if they were given the opportunity . #% This is a function of the presidency on which the Taoiseach was curiously discreet . #% So it is not a question of rumours , it is a real problem . #% Parliament , the directly elected representatives of the citizens of Europe , made a stand , proving that we MEPs are strong of will and not just a rubber stamp for the Commission . #% Madam President , let me be clear : I support new regulation on incinerators tonight , not simply to protect people living nearby from suffering from the cancers and the birth defects which British and Japanese research have demonstrated , but to shift the economic balance towards recycling and reuse . #% Virtually no animal on this planet can exist without the agreement of humans . #% The EPLP supports enhanced cooperation if Member States wish to pursue this consolidated tax base approach , as long as the proper procedures are followed and precedence is not set for future tax cooperation . #% Barcelona did , of course , touch upon the issue of liberalisation concerning the opening of the electricity and gas markets . #% You have also got the problem that you yourself are a free trader , a globalist , a moderniser . #% It is about my constituent , Mark Forrester , who was arrested on alleged football hooliganism during the EURO 2000 championships . #% More than any other measure , but in addition , reforms of structures and systems of audit control and management control that give us - insofar as any human organisation handling money can get it - real , strong safeguards against any form of repetition of what we have detected and are acting upon now . #% I too would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Malmström on this report . #% I hope this document will embody the view of the fair market access for all , in particular in clarifying the present legislative position regarding the trading of slots . #% Last year this Parliament approved the resumption of licences for EU fishing fleets to plunder the waters of Western Sahara . #% I am sorry that Saddam 's supporters in this House have been confounded . #% Private enterprise in Belarus functions poorly and the bulk of financial investment comes from Russia after a promising but short-lived start , particularly in the SME sector . #% Change will have to come in any case , change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another . #% Our biggest step forward and our biggest technological push is unquestionably the replacement of HFCs in car air conditioning systems . #% Have we finally sorted the problem of infected sheep ? #% They are at the heart of local economic development strategy and they often arise , when traditional mass employment in an area declines , to develop new services and to offer hope of work to people not getting a fair deal within the labour market . #% The large majority of air crashes are survivable technically , and effective evacuation is so important . #% Some superstate ! #% I am very grateful to Mr Lund and 32 other Members for initiating this plenary debate which enables me to report to Parliament on the issue of the Commission 's intentions and proposals . #% This is a most ill-informed proposal from the Commission . #% I am grateful for that answer , Commissioner . #% The referendum in Ireland gave us an opportunity to sit back and think about the way in which Europe develops . #% My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent . #% It is with an excess of alcohol consumption that the problem arises . #% Do not lift economic sanctions while their fate remains uncertain . #% The role of national parliaments and of the European Parliament are , and must be , complementary . #% We should recognize that the EIB can not solve the problems of unemployment in the European Union . #% They have torn it up , they have not shown good faith and it is now time for the Commission to clamp down really hard . #% This local project fully supports the extension of zerotolerance campaigns to other European countries , backed up by rape crisis telephone helplines , also absent in many of our countries . #% It is indeed bizarre that the only person detained in connection with this sorry episode is the journalist who exposed it . #% EU Governments agreed to create a common area of justice to tackle the common problem of organised crime , especially drug smuggling and human trafficking . #% May I welcome the reform of the Council itself and especially the agreed programme designed to improve the performance and coordinating role of the General Affairs Council . #% I am sure the President-in-Office of the European Council , the Taoiseach , consults you , Mr Prodi , on the sort of qualities that a President of the Commission requires . #% It is a constant disgrace that business is chopped and changed in this Parliament without consulting those who really count : the Members sitting here . #% For that reason I can confirm that , although the Socialists did not sign the compromise package of amendments , we will support them as we favour most of them and do not wish to hinder bringing them into law . #% There are those who would argue that this is due solely to the liberalisation process within that sector . #% I would ask that the continental media show some balance in the way in which they report the subject of BSE . #% Because of the very limits that Mr Huhne talked about , this is , of course , very closely controlled by the Council 's proposed waiver and particularly by some of the sensible compromises suggested earlier . #% For many of us , myself included , it was our profession before we came here and , in that sense , we have an interest . #% 
However , if there were one argument for the European Union that would make me change my mind , it would be the argument that the European Union would give us , and would guarantee , peace . #% Member States must close the loopholes in their codes on health worker recruitment and put in place effective health workforce planning so that they are no longer tempted to poach trained personnel from the very countries where better healthcare is so desperately needed . #% Mr President , it would seem that even the majority of your own MEPs are indifferent to this charade of a democratic debate . #% Perhaps , for once , you will forget your own gold-plated salaries and gold-plated pensions and think of the reality of what these initiatives cost . #% Quite simply , the Commission proposal as it stands will not achieve our aim of ensuring that the EU no longer provides a market for illegally logged timber . #% I am proud to be associated with the rejection of the original report and , I hope , the passing of the report as amended . #% What will our exit strategy from trade sanctions be ? #% That being said , we were unable to vote in favour of this report for several specific reasons . #% When I spoke to farmers in my constituency they wished that they had a unique selling proposition which could prove that their herds were BSE free , that they were free of antibiotics or whatever . #% I am grateful that you wrote in the past , but last week his leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was turned down . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur for her report . #% I should like to thank the rapporteur , who has had an extremely difficult task in trying to improve the deeply flawed document received from the Council , which some of us see as an affront to human rights and to those seeking sanctuary . #% I am pleased that we have moved away from just a list of countries where human rights abuses are a problem and I welcome the new measures we are taking in this report . #% I fear very much on the basis of the experience in the United Kingdom that foot-and-mouth disease is not going away and that we may be dealing with it over a long period . #% Madam President , if we are absolutely honest with ourselves , we do not actually know what to do about Algeria . #% The post of European Ombudsman is one of the most valuable and least controversial fruits of the Treaty of Maastricht . #% Depriving the electorate of their only representation on the local council , and making an example of somebody who has brought to the public 's attention an act which is not in the best interests either of that council or the European Union , is hardly an incentive to others to raise such issues . #% The rapporteur asserts that people are asking how Europe improves their living conditions . #% We want to be sure that we have an agreed basis of rights for the majority of third-country nationals , as originally set out by the Commission and generally improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% That can not be done unless the individuals within them examine their own beliefs and actions . #% Secondly , when we leave this Chamber we are met with a scrum . #% I am sure when the scheme is set up and running it will be a huge success and I have been very proud to be part of this initiative . #% My colleagues and I were desperately disappointed that the Council felt it could not agree to our proposal to transform the environmental inspections recommendation into a directive . #% The Commission is gratified by the fact that Parliament has given a warm welcome to this latest report and grateful also to Mr Koukiadis and his colleagues for their work . #% This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament , the Council or the Commission . #% Notwithstanding that a handful of extremist demonstrators tried to spoil it in Göteborg , we will ultimately look back on solid achievements under your presidency of the Council . #% It is important also that the EU engages constructively with Belarus where , notwithstanding our differences , we must engage positively in areas of mutual interest , like border controls , and in order to encourage reforms and democracy and discourage self-isolation by that government . #% I am informed that Mr Pannella was refused the right to amend the calendar by the Presidency in the same way that I was two years ago , as it threatened the twelve Strasbourg part-sessions , albeit within the letter of the Treaties . #% I am not criticising support for bee-keeping , but I think that this Parliament was right to increase the amount that the Commission wanted for information on enlargement from EUR 14 million to EUR 21 million . #% This means that in relation to developing nations we must make sure that trade relations can actually help their economies . #% These are just two of the many very valuable points enshrined in this report which I hope will receive very broad support in Parliament . #% We will do all we can to stop them in their tracks and continue to improve , and not undermine , worker protection . #% My group 's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster , just as my group 's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions . #% The break-up of the European single currency , which is only a matter of time , will kill political and economic integration stone dead once and for all . #% The arguments are correct . #% I hope this House will reject the majority of amendments so that we will have an opinion from the European Parliament which is realistic and constructive in adapting the European model of agriculture to new economic and social conditions as set out in the joint resolution from our colleagues , Mr Fantuzzi and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf . #% There is also the question about dealing with tax problems for frontier workers . #% To Mr Giansily I would say that if we do not do that , then we as a Parliament , as a Budgets Committee , will lose control over the funding of that agency . #% So far agreement has been reached on the dialogue , which will include all departments with responsibility for human rights-related matters , including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Ministry of Justice , the Ministry of the Interior , the Ministry of Public Security and the Office of the Prime Minister . #% We have looked in this amendment to return to the first reading position of two years . #% I congratulate Mrs Klamt and Mrs Karamanou , but on some points my group is not entirely happy . #% What a tragedy for the people of Iraq to have a ruler such as Saddam Hussein , a brutal dictator who has exploited the wealth of the country for his own ends and ambitions and oppressed his own people . #% There is a reasonably large number of residents and citizens from the European Union , and from African and South American countries who , perhaps legitimately , want to consume this if it can be provided on a sustainable basis . #% We can not leave it simply to governments . #% I want to refer to some points on that in a moment but I just want to support what Mrs Berès said about the wide-ranging nature of the debate this afternoon . #% That seems to be quite a long way away , but let us hope it is worth the wait . #% Or is it just that when the EU sees something successful , it has to interfere , regulate and destroy it ? #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialists on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy I should like to welcome the Members of the Duma . #% I hope that all MEPs will join me in condemning those who send 16-year old children , strapped with explosives , to blow themselves up together with innocent shoppers who have just popped out to buy something from the local cheese shop . #% Madam President , you will be aware that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is currently meeting in our Brussels building . #% Therefore it has been important to update the 1989-1990 regulations , to bring greater clarity and greater legal certainty to improve the definition of the main spirit drinks and to resolve any problems with spirits with a quasi-geographical indication status . #% A 15-page general summary does not exactly do justice to the 500 initiatives cited in the annex . #% Very difficult to implement in practice , it would be a barrier to trade and it would completely contradict the Commission 's intention to harmonise the internal market which will be further fragmented . #% If so , how much money ? #% The proposal before us today provides us with a much valued opportunity to take this work forward . #% Dare I extend Mr Hökmark 's remarks and suggest that if the Commission is truly interested in promoting competition it should include regulatory competition . #% Mr President , I join in the general congratulations of Mrs Ferreira on reaching what is a sensible and welcome compromise on this revision of the directive . #% We can not therefore follow Mr Lehne in his amendments on accountants and auditors . #% That person left the Commission 's employment on 31 December 2001 . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this resolution as part of a sensible reaction by European politicians from 27 countries to this fraudulent behaviour . #% European Union-owned vessels are involved , sailing both under their own flags and under the flags of third countries . #% If Africa is to escape from its poverty trap , it will need to expand the exploitation of its raw materials , strengthen its manufacturing base and increase its exports , but at the same time it will need to improve its scientific expertise . #% All those airlines can make money at a difficult time . #% We must ensure that there is no oppression of those people who wish to move around , to exercise their right to free movement . #% The idea that individual Member States should surrender their national prerogative on matters of human rights to the European Union , whether in the forum of the United Nations or elsewhere , is totally unacceptable . #% Worse still , because of the restricted hours they were allowed under the contracts the Commission agreed with them it appears , according to a document I have received , that : ` the teachers may not be entitled to unemployment benefits , early retirement and social security cover ' . #% 
I am sorry to have to make a point of order again about smoking in the workplace . #% It is important because suicide is the tenth most important cause of death in the world - in the United Kingdom it is the ninth , ahead of road accidents . #% That is one more good reason for the British people to reject the European Constitution when they have the opportunity to do so . #% Everything is open here in Parliament . #% Secondly , is there likely to be a second IGC - which would be absolutely wrong ? #% I would also like to thank the Minister of State himself for his willingness to prioritize this matter with us in the European Parliament . #% The plane was surrounded by police guards and he was told not to step off the plane . #% Would he like to perhaps give a response on the issue of end use ? #% But next door , Pakistan is potentially a catastrophe in the making - a nuclear arms state plagued by Islamist radicalisation , corruption and feeble leadership , which , nevertheless , we have to help for strategic reasons . #% We will not win the war on terrorism - which we are all talking about at the moment - unless we control arms , the tools of this deadly trade . #% However , since then very little has happened , in spite of the fact that the Commission has joined and echoed that support for an ICO quality programme . #% Broadly speaking , we can welcome it as evidenced by the fact that we have not tabled any amendments . #% This directive sets out to identify and prevent subsidies which distort competition . #% I would also like to thank my own researcher , Michelle Smythe , and everyone from the Commission and the Council , under both the Swedish and Belgian presidencies , who have brought this forward . #% Can anyone think of an example where that has improved the situation ? #% Finally , I would endorse Mr Cushnahan 's remarks about granting visa-free access to residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region . #% I was surprised to discover that Mrs Honeyball , an MEP for the UK Labour Party , is calling for a Commission directive on annual road taxes in the European Union , and on the structure of car purchase tax on the grounds of completing the single market , when the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer is quoted on the front page of today 's newspapers as saying ` We must explicitly reject old flawed assumptions that a single market should lead inexorably to tax harmonisation , fiscal federalism and then a federal state ' . #% It is clear that regional integration is in the overall interests of the population but not unless special measures are taken to defend the interests of all who are vulnerable . #% The Clinton administration appeased North Korea for years , bankrolling the regime while it starved its own people and secretly carried on developing nuclear weapons , contrary to the 1994 agreement . #% Such jibes degrade Parliament as an institution and the European Union as a political process . #% However , it must be a shared policy in partnership with Russia , not a covert way of directing some EU policy towards Russia . #% It is a challenge to this House , through voting for the amendments passed in the Internal Market Committee , to fashion a directive that allows Europe to walk the walk and not just talk the talk of liberalisation , and that creates new jobs and does not just protect the status quo . #% The family is and always has been of essential value for European citizens , although its form varies and is changing . #% In your letter of 14 July it appears to me that this House is putting Members ' health below that of the state of the carpets . #% We do not accept , however , that the imposition of legal quotas is the way to achieve equality of treatment . #% When you lecture the rest of Europe about the merits of modernisation , competition and flexibility , yet leave out any reference at all to sustainability : it completely undermines any claims you make to be committed to sustainable development . #% And if you feel that , for reasons of transparency and for negotiations , you can not give us this , then at least give us summary positions and tell us what our basic principles are in these negotiations . #% More generally , I have long been calling for a similar system , a certification , to cover other natural resources extracted in Africa in order to prevent brutal governments or guerrilla groups from selling minerals to fund arms purchases . #% It would be naive of those of us on the centre right in European politics to give any comfort to political groups that are closely linked to terrorists . #% If we argued this before , we can not now argue that it is wrong to penalise efficiency . #% Unlike Mr Pflüger , I therefore urge the EU to add the LTTE to its list of proscribed terrorist organisations . #% Reducing tax and red tape would be a splendid start . #% As the English author , George Orwell , might have observed , all Member States are equal , but some are more equal than others . #% Well , not us ! #% How are we to tackle that ? #% In terms of public awareness , I know that there are programmes in each Member State to give information to consumers in particular , but also businesses . #% I believe that a ban on location clauses is essential to delivering a competitive framework in the EU car market . #% Originally the scheme was for 3 years , although we wanted longer to increase investor confidence . #% The list , however , has to be meaningful and provide the basis of effective action in this field and not be a statement of general intent . #% Perhaps this is linked with the previous point . #% Mr President , what we are debating is the proposal that Parliament and the Council should delegate substantial implementing powers to the Commission . #% I hope governments will not succumb to the temptation to try in any way to skew that policy mix at the forthcoming summit . #% Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to say that the budget for 2003 has gone wonderfully well . #% . Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking the members of the Committee on Citizen 's Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs for their unanimous support on this very important report . #% I hope that this proposal will be widely supported . #% In the 1996 and 1997 communications the Commission seemed to be willing to do that . #% This is the key to bringing peace , as is the need to put in place humanitarian assistance , protection for civilians and so on . #% It is not perfect , it is a compromise . #% Listen to the people , please . #% There is nothing new about this . #% I wonder if he would listen in particular to those people who are working in the field of public health and their concerns that what has been a very good programme on public health care , health promotion and illness prevention seems to be disappearing . #% We can quite understand why the Council has put into place the derogations that Mr Cox has outlined . #% Will it , in fact , be largely intergovernmental ? #% But it also addresses this problem of undeclared work . #% The primary achievements are : firstly , to make a clearer distinction between legislative and executive acts ; secondly , to rationalise the choice of the instruments available so that force will more clearly follow form and , thirdly , to bring in a clearer class of subordinate legislation which should contribute not only to the quality of primary legislation but also to the parliamentary scrutiny of what is passed . #% That is why we are saying that the homeless themselves and their organizations should be consulted about relevant European programmes . #% What the foreign ministers appear to be clever at is unpicking the essential ingredients of the Convention 's proposals . #% The EU is very good at churning out laws : is transparently obvious . #% We have this instrument of huge potential and , particularly with public budgets still amounting to 16 % of the European economy , why are we not using our public procurement budgets to drive innovation , to buy those new technologies , to encourage SMEs to take those up ? #% The EU ministerial troika which visited Belgrade on 8 February also expressed concern at the fact that the proposed amnesty law will not cover all those convicted of political offences by the Milosevic regime . #% The Commission does not , however , ignore the reality that many people in modern societies wish to sustain stable partnerships but do not wish to enter into matrimony . #% That is the simplest way to reinforce the Euro-scepticism that is growing across the EU and which , sadly , is prevalent in Denmark . #% The detention of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism is a very serious matter . #% Farmers and hauliers need to make a living and the BSE fiasco has not helped . #% We already know about the suppression of the ancient Buddhist Tibetan culture over the last 60 years ; now we see the same threat looming over the city of Kashgar in the restive province of Xinjiang . #% There are no means to enforce respect for agreed judicial assistance measures , as there would be if the area fell within Community competence . #% 
Indeed , it is the fourth year running that his Commission has failed to get a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors for its accounts , and the ninth time running that the Commission , as an entity , has failed to do so . #% It is quite revealing also that it is only a recommendation . #% It has another vital role and that is in the area of medical research . #% This is a vast potential market . #% Therefore this German initiative , one for which I am very pleased to be the rapporteur , is aimed at trying to bring this matter effectively and efficiently to a conclusion . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her serious and very committed work on this issue and also the work that our own committee has done , as Mr Rocard has just pointed out . #% The reality is that far from promoting the greater security Europe needs , the illiberal Blair-Aznar-Berlusconi trio risks creating greater threats for European citizens by their hysterical , populist and macho responses to current challenges . #% That is what has been successful in mobiles so far . #% Although many of the letters from lobbyists on both sides of the argument may well be valid , before we ban things , we ought to have proper assessments . #% Could I ask you to discuss with your colleagues and arrange for a statement and a report to be made to this House as soon as possible about the progress of these crucial reforms which were solidly supported by the House when it approved my report last year ? #% This should give companies , including many small businesses in Wales who rely on these vans , an opportunity to use more fuel-efficient vans and control costs at a time of rising oil prices . #% We in the UK have some of the most crowded and some of the safest roads anywhere in western Europe . #% I wonder , since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber , whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government . #% Mr President , this is a period when we confirm the end to historic divisions . #% Mr President , after 15 minutes from Mr Färm and 10 minutes from Mr Stenmarck and all the other contributions , there is not much left to say . #% We congratulate the two rapporteurs , as always , but we would like in this particular budget to take a cautious approach to the budget overall . #% We need to address the problems in a country that is going to be on our borders in July next year . #% One is regularly made : culture and education are important for Europe , not just for the past but for the future of our continent . #% It is important because , as the Harvard World Bank report showed , mental disorder accounts for some 10.5 % of the global health burden and that is forecast to rise to 15 % by the year 2020 . #% My concern is for the incentives for small and medium enterprises to which there is only a passing reference in this document . #% This is recognised in the declaration attached to the cooperation agreement . #% The Orange Revolution , which heralded a remarkable change in democratic thinking in Ukraine , occurred without any EU carrots being held out to change its system of government . #% Logically , if there are tax breaks for companies which use recycled materials and import controls which favour equipment with high proportions of recycled materials as well as tax breaks for companies that process the materials , this would create a market . #% Madam President , this report relates to the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee , and it is therefore far too late to affect the course of this directive - not that a single or group of MEPs could do that anyway . #% It is impossible to defend that before the citizens . #% Now other considerations such as safety and economy are more pertinent . #% It is a shame if the elevation of President Chávez to an icon of anti-globalisation and anti-capitalism blinds some in this House to the drift towards an authoritarian and anti-democratic system . #% This is a health measure rather than anything to do with production or with harmonising duty , though that we accept the latter as a principle . #% I want to list some of the achievements that we have secured in respect of port state control . #% It is quite possible under the existing regime for a self-employed , a ` false ' self-employed , driver , to drive between 86 and 95 hours per week ; perhaps not every week , but one week is enough of a danger in itself . #% If the new Constitution contains improvements , then it is better to take the new Constitution rather than carry on living with the old one . #% Mrs Roth-Behrendt 's amendments also provide for a process of review from the year 2000 onwards and that too is eminently correct . #% It must be able to find ways to add value to the basic products that we may be importing from elsewhere . #% She has followed this dossier very carefully because of the large fishing industry in her constituency in Ireland . #% If you accept this opening proposition at face value then of course the report 's recommendations follow as a logical consequence : a common European space policy , the implementation of the European security and defence policy , the use of the Galileo satellite system for military purposes , and , of course , a budget to pay for it all . #% It should not be about private versus state . #% I wish to say something about the many people who correspond with us about allergies . #% If that is agreed to , then we will be calling a meeting of the Committee on Budgets at 10.30 a.m. this morning . #% Or are we going to continue with a situation where the press are just going to use it to attack Member States ? #% Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Schmidt for his excellent report . #% Therefore we should be looking to strengthen the government by support for reform of the public administration , by improved interpretation facilities and by ensuring the democratic organisation work at grassroots . #% There is room for all organisations , large and small . #% There were bizarre proposals from the Commission on the destruction of data that would have inhibited the law enforcement authorities in the fight against fraud and financial crime . #% Equally you can not with impunity shout ` fire ' in a cinema . #% It is purely a simple and very practical measure which will bring about the result which has to occur from time to time once the proper legal processes have been exhausted . #% I hope we will hear the announcement of that in 2003 . #% However , we still have the problem of the EUR 27 million and I await with interest to see what the Council will do with that sum on 19 July . #% The consumer can be conned by counterfeiting in all circumstances very easily but it is always a menace . #% Our discussions and debates have also played a role , including those with the Commission and the Council , which have often been forceful , yet always positive . #% Article 1 of the European Commission-Vietnam Cooperation Agreement of 1995 states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis of our cooperation . #% The session services knew it would not be finished and there are other debates scheduled later which you know from your computer system could have been slotted in there . #% In our report we wish to make sure that police authorities throughout Europe take action to deal with these matters . #% I am not as reassured on this point as the rapporteur and I would have preferred to see a separate budget line which could have been seen and monitored more easily . #% Everything else should be subjugated to it . #% In particular , the success he had in taking that agenda to the Chinese and moving forward the Chinese agenda has been one of the successes of this presidency . #% I do not believe that Mr Barroso 's pledge to fight social dumping in Europe is far-reaching enough , and it is for this reason , as well as the abovementioned , that I took the decision to abstain on this vote . #% We need to stress how the EU offers both security in the classic sense and an internal strengthening and dynamism , which makes us able to compete in the world and deliver prosperity . #% The European Parliament 's Conference of Presidents also gave their clear political support . #% I would like to pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur , Jo Leinen , in this respect , and indeed to all those who came before him in preparing the way , notably Professor Tsatsos in his report a number of years ago . #% The capacities and needs of one country are not the same as any other . #% These both have to be a sensible approach . #% He wants nothing more than democratic reforms and the end of one-party Communist rule in China . #% Thank you Commissioner . #% They have to accept cutting their economy to a level that will put them in total economic depression . #% Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy . #% That leaves you and me looking through a lot of amendments that can sometimes be rather confusing . #% 
Indeed , it is my view that the Council has rather cynically orchestrated the eight-month delay in response to the first reading in order that it could better manage its negotiations on the South Africa trade and development agreements . #% Turning to other questions , my group certainly welcomes the efforts made by the Greek Presidency on the question of temporary agency work , currently blocked through more political game-playing by particular Member States . #% Although reduction of NOx is very desirable , it must be remembered that will be achieved at the expense of increased CO2 emissions . #% It is not even the status quo . #% The public has long made clear that it wants an end to animal testing for no better purpose than to ensure the development of yet more vanity products to fill our bathroom shelves , such as all the deodorants , soaps , and hair shampoos to be found on supermarket shelves . #% Mr President , I listened with interest to the Commissioner 's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market . #% I am pleased to be here to support Mrs Trautmann 's report , particularly because I was part of the delegation that went to the first World Summit on the Information Society in December 2003 with her distinguished predecessor , Erkki Liikanen . #% But whether one agrees with that or not , I think that what is happening with the state of emergency is really beginning to reflect a clear lack of checks and balances within the system there , particularly given the reports , as we have just been hearing , of mass arrests , the lack of due process , the allegations of torture , reports of extrajudicial killings , pressure on journalists and increasing violence against women . #% We did not actually need the reference in the Rules of Procedure . #% I would urge the President to make representations immediately to the government in Rangoon to protest against such an action taking place . #% Clearly the internal investigations in Russia into these fraud allegations should be actively encouraged . #% If you do that , obviously improving the environment in the process , then you are subject to the full force of these regulations and would possibly be faced with extremely expensive compliance costs for your craft . #% I must pay tribute to organisations like , in Britain , the National Film School in Beaconsfield , which needs help to do its work . #% This seems to be a charter for Commissioners just to tell their civil servants not to inform them of the dubious activities going on in their departments , so that , on the basis of the Commission 's analysis , the Commissioner will get off scot-free . #% The Irish referendum taught us one important lesson . #% About ten years ago , my sister-in-law , married to my twin brother , invited me to their home for the weekend . #% As a matter of information for Members , with the vote which has gone through now , the total payments will be 1.11 % of Europe 's GNP which is under the ceiling for the year 2000 of the financial perspective of 1.13 % and under the ceiling for own resources of 1.27 % . #% This is not practical and we must have an overall end to the journey . #% The United Kingdom has had to deal with the Irish Republican terrorism of Sinn Féin / IRA for over three decades and as they say themselves , they have not gone away , you know . #% It occurs to me that two years after the 1998 budget freeze , it might be time now for the Commission to respond to what are very clear needs from the European-based social NGOs for core funding to cover their running costs . #% I have letters from trade unions in the UK who support this directive , who fear for job losses if we do not have some kind of directive . #% Let me say Mr President , that discrimination diminishes every single one of us and if we stand by and do nothing , we endorse it . #% I have been in negotiation with the Greek authorities and British consular officials throughout the weekend and welcome the fact that a ferry has been laid on to evacuate the stranded drivers starting tonight . #% In the case of defined contribution schemes , which give the investor a direct stake in the overall health of the national economy , there will also be a sense of participation in the country of that individual . #% Europe also needs direction on its future financing . #% It is that competitive market which will ensure that consumers are protected , not heavy-handed legislation which might stunt e-commerce and leave others around the world to reap the benefits of a revolution in our economy which is unparalleled since the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century . #% In addition , measures were agreed at Tampere to make it easier for ordinary people to travel , live and work across Europe . #% Are other national governments taking the same line ? #% It sets the target dates to end that marketing . #% I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment , training , appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals . #% There is great hope for the future , but we must make sure that we keep up the pressure on Zimbabwe and especially on Mr Mugabe . #% That indeed is referred to as well in our paragraph 4 , sixth indent , because it is the impact of high social costs or taxes on jobs at the lower end of the wage scale which is contributing to maintaining uncomfortably high levels , particularly of youth unemployment . #% This proposal , the first of its kind , could see everyday citizens involved in and having say about issues ranging from air quality to the protection of water . #% I have with me today - and I risk being arrested , I brought them for you , Mr Byrne - two British prime steaks . #% It has been much appreciated by my region and the support that we have given to the people immediately affected . #% Recognising this as the priority we voted for Amendment No 21 . #% Time and again we have seen reports passing through the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism highlighting the inequalities that exist as a result of a system that fails the very people it sets out to help . #% We seem to be moving on with the internal market , hopefully to a position where we will get an internal market that functions properly and fairly for all our citizens and businesses . #% We need to work towards a common European asylum policy . #% Finally , I should like to thank Parliament on behalf of the Commission for its amendments . #% Albania , like Turkey , must now decide between embracing western values , or whether to give primacy to those of sharia law which the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg has deemed incompatible with European values , though so far , in my view , Albania 's membership of the OIC , in fairness , seems only nominal . #% To a certain extent , I believe that is what the Commission is trying to say . #% This has been raised several times . #% All , and I repeat all , the various versions of the compromise amendments were discussed in the LIBE Committee and following the trialogue meetings . #% I trust the Commission will continue its efforts to build the necessary political will , based since 2001 on an increasing knowledge of what actually works in the field at this time . #% I am concerned because there is a danger that some products of high toxicity which have not yet been regulated or properly examined , are still remaining in the market , whilst others , which are of no conceivable danger and are very low on Lists 3 and 4 , are going to be taken out of the market because those who produce them , and they do indeed in some cases come into the category of essential uses , are likely to be unable to produce the complex dossier needed to go through all of the processes initially set out in what , as the rapporteur says , has been an extraordinarily slow process . #% Indeed it is the government 's stated intention that the UK should not be seriously out of line with our European partners in this important area of immigration policy . #% That is not specific to the UK . #% We are now faced with a disaster of such magnitude that it is no longer just a transport issue , it is also an environmental , social and fishing issue , which is why my group believes a committee of inquiry is needed to ascertain what went wrong with the Prestige . #% Would he recognise that we have made a lot of progress together in our gradually evolving Constitution , in that the Council now at least publishes the results of all its votes on legislation and grants the public a right of access to documents , but that it would be worth going one last extra step and actually meeting and voting in public when adopting legislation ? #% Health and safety at work has of course improved over the last few years in the European Union , partly due to the legislation we have adopted ourselves . #% The difficulties that have been thrown up can be overcome if there is a will to do so . #% Much , as Commissioner Patten said , remains to be done . #% Given that he has admitted to this Chamber today that he and his colleagues have not even discussed this issue , at the very least will he respond to the request from this Parliament that he should table such a discussion ? #% It is an island separated from the mainland by just five kilometres of water . #% The Socialist Group firmly rejects the guidelines adopted by the ECOFIN Council recently and we are deeply unhappy with the approach taken by the Commission regarding the economic prospects for the European Union . #% Finally , I would call upon all Members of this House to support these amendments and to get this regulation on the statute book as soon as possible so that we can put a proper contingency plan in place in the unfortunate event of an outbreak of avian influenza hitting Europe . #% With the Council 's acceptance of this compromise , the measures contained in this report can be brought into force without delay . #% That we know is virtually impossible , but some Member States may wish to coordinate their referendums within a certain time period . #% Parliament , in its resolution on the tragedy , made special mention of those engaged in fishing , calling on the Commission to examine ways in which tangible aid in the form of vessels , gear , technical expertise and raw materials can be directed towards the affected communities . #% I want to say in response to previous remarks -- it is a pity that some speakers have already left -- that the Commissioner 's support for the Internal Market Services Directive is very welcome because it is a fundamental part of completing the internal market . #% Since it is presently the case that most SMEs have some difficulty in breaking into the technology market , this financial assistance can often symbolise the make or break of a potentially very successful SME . #% It will be betraying the very principles it claims to support . #% Indeed , one or two of her amendments , like removing paragraphs 47 and 48 of the discharge report today show that some of these amendments look more Commission-born than in Parliament 's interests . #% It is not a problem you can hide behind , saying ` well , we need to assess this ' and ` we need to assess that ' , or whatever . #% Some of this work I saw for myself just last week in my own region . #% 
I also commend the Commission 's recognition that SMEs need help and a helpful environment in all stages of their development , not just in starting off and growing . #% It is also good to remark , as colleagues have said , that this debate is attended by French , German , Austrian , Belgian , British and other colleagues . #% These are four clear political agenda items which we in the European Union have to address . #% It is no good one or two Member States deciding to go it alone for trade reasons . #% The same goes for the Court . #% Firstly the question as to whether this is an interim solution . #% I support Ms Lulling 's recommendations that the national systems should recognise the importance of protecting self-employed workers , and we should stand against all forms of discrimination , but I am still not convinced that this House is best placed to work on employment matters . #% So , while I am grateful to you for speaking to us tonight , I would like to make clear that this does not constitute any kind of political scrutiny . #% I hope that before our vote on the motion of censure in May the Commission will accept its responsibility and do something serious to take responsibility for Eurostat and to clean up the EU and stop the unacceptable waste and abuse of taxpayers ' money . #% That is a disgrace to the world . #% Therefore we agreed to a deal that would bring benefits for Parliament and the other institutions and a sensible approach to Category 5 , not as the Commission wanted . #% The IGC must not unravel the Convention , must not pick it apart . #% The proposed Indicator offers no tangible benefits to a global trading nation , simply one of the many tools to pursue the dreadful objective of a federal Europe . #% For example , the helicopters used against civilians and insurgents by the security forces in Nepal contain EU components . #% Is this also the Commission 's understanding , and what steps is it taking in the single market to make sure that stops ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , may I first congratulate the Swedish Presidency on progress at the recent summit in developing the European Union 's position on climate change . #% We have a level of transparency that does not put private equity at a significant disadvantage compared to sovereign wealth funds , and we have come to a better place on depository liability , where we are not concentrating systemic risk . #% One of the reasons why there is absence here is that I , myself , for example , have had to come away from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy where one on my own reports is now being voted upon because I have prioritized diabetes over stage III of economic and monetary union . #% I have to say that it will be very difficult for us , the British Labour Members , to support this and we will probably have to abstain because of the very firm commitment in three of the paragraphs , Nos 19 to 21 , on communitization of third pillar matters . #% If Member States had proper border controls and checks , this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations . #% I also believe that this industry will be the spearhead of this century , in the same way as coal , steel and the infrastructure of railways were the impetus for the development of the revolution in the 19th century . #% Even if we achieve the Lisbon target of 60 % for labour market participation by women , the target itself acknowledges the fact that women 's participation will continue to be less than men 's . #% Nor should the EU blithely enter into agreements with countries which are blatantly abusing human rights . #% I very much agree with the Commissioner 's views on decoupling and very much support them . #% The code of conduct will enhance the effectiveness of the common foreign and security policy . #% Mr President , if the rapporteur 's original draft report had gone through and had been accepted , it would have decimated industry across the EU . #% Had he been here a little earlier his French voters might have been happier about the outcome of the vote on the Brussels/Strasbourg question which was lost by one vote . #% Mr President , I see two problems with this morning ' s debate . #% However , what I would like to press the Commissioner on is the fact that Community law is being discredited . #% Mr President , both my Group and I appreciate that when we are seeking parliamentary time it is advisable to be brief . #% But I call on the UK Government to do all they can to persuade Zimbabwe to set up an independent arbitration board fully representative of the landless people and , once it is set up , perhaps with the assistance of the Commonwealth , to resume financial aid as soon as possible . #% So , we come to the award of fishing rights to the EU fleets in waters around the Seychelles . #% The convention itself , introduced before the age of cheap mass jet travel , was a response to the horrors of Nazism and designed to protect the principle of asylum . #% Two separate votes are required here . #% Mr Vitorino said at the beginning that free movement is subject to too many obstacles , and Mrs Buitenweg has just given some examples that make this obvious . #% Speaking for myself , I think that both bodies should be involved : the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to establish an authentic interpretation and the Bureau to comment on the discourtesy shown by the Labour Party in suspending four of its members after the President had made it clear he wished to have the code of conduct further discussed and considered . #% Mr President , on a point of order , the Minister of Justice of Austria has come all this way . #% The clock is still ticking with Council , we have time to take it there . #% We believe that the EU has a role to play in the defence of fundamental rights ; however , it is the Member States who carry the first responsibility , in line with their traditions of democracy and the rule of law . #% I wish to highlight just one issue as raised in paragraph 49 , on human rights issues in Kashmir . #% Any limitation on the present Commission mandate is in contradiction of our request to encourage the mandate to be extended . #% You are trying to cobble together a mini-treaty , getting rid of the ` C ' word and thereby denying the peoples of Europe the opportunity to vote on their own future . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Schröder on his report . #% All that , in my opinion , is to the good . #% It is only the marketing of new devices that is prohibited . #% This might not catch the headlines but through removal of misunderstanding and more effective action against extremists , it may actually help create some of the conditions for peace . #% It is also an issue of cross-border service providers and increasing provision from third country providers . #% The previous presidency had given its commitment to resolving the matter . #% I look forward to seeing further directives , perhaps starting with disability . #% However , there are more serious points which we should perhaps draw to your attention . #% I look forward to hearing their arguments on this , but it is in conformity with what Parliament adopted in the Bourlanges report only a few months ago . #% There are many business that we want to use the network , the Internet , to sell to consumers all over Europe . #% I should like to make one point clear to the Commission on this - I am not too sure that it is directed at DG XIX so much as DG XVI : we are not kidding , this is serious , we want to see the monies we have made available for Rechar and Retex implemented . #% The European Commission has worked hand in hand with the committee , and it is no coincidence that tomorrow it will come forward with its proposals for the future . #% They have survived the past in an extraordinary fashion and remained civilised and perennially charming . #% Can I make one point about the Greens ' amendment ? #% I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them . #% Ultimately , the decision on whether or not to gamble is a personal decision and the individual must be responsible for the consequences . #% As Chairman , it is my job to respect the committee 's position , not to oppose it . #% We have heard a lot of this from other speakers as well . #% The fact is that warlords continue to hold sway in many of the more remote areas , and their commitment to peaceful development and democracy is largely non-existent . #% It has been on our agenda since as long ago as 1993 . #% As a Parliament we then called on the Commission to improve its infringement procedures and its dealings with complainants , calling in particular for correspondence passing between the Commission and the Member States to be made available . #% We must stand firm against the sort of sick minds who feed on fear and hatred of minorities , whether they are planting nail bombs in London or engaging in mass murder in Kosovo . #% It was not possible of course to carry out the evaluation until the programme was finally completed . #% Mr President , in my view the greatest service that could be given to the people of south-eastern Turkey is for Kurdish extremist groups to cease their campaign of violence and terrorism . #% 
We should also reflect at the end of 2010 not just on the state of the Union , but on the state of Belgium . #% It is also firmly rooted in existing decisions of the Amsterdam Treaty and the Petersberg , Berlin , and Madrid Declarations . #% But we must do more to harness the knowledge economy by investing in the projects of the future and not the past . #% Not satisfied with this disaster , the EU is actually encouraging its repetition in African coastal waters . #% Precision is at the heart of what Mrs Paulsen has had to say to us today . #% I am also deeply worried by the rise in Russian antiSemitism . #% The travelling arrangements require that assistance be afforded by moving those particular persons by air and transiting them through other European countries on the way back to where they have to go . #% General Khin Nyunt , the newly-appointed Prime Minister , has talked about a roadmap to democracy . #% Reinforcing such revolutionary transborder investment in the TENs is to secure the principle of a comprehensive and universal service concept in respect of Europe 's public services . #% We also wanted design adaptations to make the building fully accessible and state-of-the-art . #% It ought to be pointed out to the Commissioner that both Mr Kellett-Bowman and myself have worked extremely hard to try to seek dégagement for the staff remaining in Thessaloniki , Berlin and other capitals and institutions who , because of the terms of their contract , which was originally CEDEFOP , do not seek or are unhappy with the move to Thessaloniki . #% First of all I would like to make a point about the legal base . #% Mr President , I will concentrate on the issue of civil aviation safety . #% It specifically refers to interinstitutional agreements ; it even categorises them . #% I , for instance , was allowed into Parliament this evening without even showing my security pass . #% So does the honest and legitimate businessman ; and so does the cold-caller with the lottery scam ; the rip-off timeshare artist ; the peddler of mock sales . #% If not , can you tell us how you square your so-called support for developing countries with your agenda , which is running precisely counter to their interests and wishes ? #% One further area which will need to be watched carefully is the need for the new Legislative Council to pass legislation on issues such as subversion and treason under Article 23 of the Basic Law . #% Some critical amendments in this report will require , of course , 314 votes . #% The use of these weapons has already , therefore , been condemned in international law . #% Mr President , I rise on a point of order under Rule 132 about Commission Question Time last night . #% If I can explain procedurally and very briefly , the Social Affairs Committee voted on Monday evening at the same time as the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy and , with the agreement of the draftsman , I have taken over some of his proposals and put them down in my own political group 's name . #% At the solemn sitting in homage to the victims of terrorism held in this House in March 2005 he wisely counselled us not to use such terrible events to push political messages , and then did so himself . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I would like to point out to the Commissioner that we are going to have to carry on talking about old and new Member States for as long as we have the transition periods to which my colleague , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten referred . #% On a more serious note , I would like to thank many colleagues here this evening for their support and cooperation in producing this report , which really was a collective effort . #% However , if you look at the amendments that have been tabled on Thursday , for instance to the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report , you will see that there are over 100 amendments which are tabled by individuals , supposedly in the name of their political group , but this may well not be the case . #% Let me urge that we are cautious and do not rush into new legislation . #% This is a much-needed report and , for obvious reasons , the accidents in Romania and Spain , but also other incidents that have taken place around the Union over time , have demonstrated quite clearly that this kind of material poses a real danger to human health and to the environment if it is mismanaged . #% In recent weeks , many poorer countries have made it clear that for them addressing concerns about the implementation of Uruguay Round commitments should be a precondition for a new round . #% By remembering those who have died , we can do more to prevent accidents at work . #% What I am asking is : are you able to categorically confirm that the building satisfies these regulations , yes or no ? #% I hope this will be supported . #% Future legislation should always pass the test of being easily understood and transparent in purpose and effect . #% We have , for example , sought to implement the EU 's human rights guidelines , with a particular focus on freedom of expression , by action in support of those who defend human rights where they have suffered for exercising their freedom of expression . #% Eleven million people will die of preventable diseases this year . #% The full benefit of all these will not be felt until we move towards pan-European rules of cumulation . #% Why have our actions lacked punch up until now ? #% Our focus for the future in relation to small arms should be on identifying and destroying stocks of weapons held by insurgents , terrorists and criminals and cutting off their sources of supply . #% A UK minister in the late 1940s once remarked that Britain 's economy was safe for years to come because , he said , we live on an island of coal , surrounded by fish . #% As you know question time is supposed to last a full hour . #% You have made it clear that you believe that you have gone as far as you can , as Commissioner , to make GATS texts available to us . #% Vanunu revealed to the British press that Israel had nuclear weapons . #% It is my fear that in an understandable but misguided wish for the European Union to have its own defence capability , politicians are forging ahead with plans that are at best wishful thinking , and at worst dangerous . #% So we welcome the return of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah . #% I very much hope that we will continue to apply the criteria of the Treaty , no more and no less . #% It will be of great interest to see whether , assuming Parliament as a whole adopts the recommendation , as I hope it will , in the subsequent conciliation negotiations the minimal stance of the Council and the more progressive and realistic approach of the Commission - which I know places considerable importance on these proposals to the extent of unusually reserving its position - can be reconciled with the more forward-thinking proposals from this Parliament . #% Mr President , I really can only echo what my friend and colleague , Mr Miller , has said . #% Very little has been achieved in recent years because of the determined blocking of the political process by particular lobbies that threw dirt in the potential way forward of solving the administrative problems and indeed denied the whole scientific basis . #% I recently benefited from a course of acupuncture to remove the pain of sciatica and can guarantee and vouch for the effectiveness of at least one type of complementary treatment . #% What tax rates do they apply ? #% Madam President , I will be circulating an e-mail petition and would urge all colleagues to support it , either to have the case reviewed in the light of the new evidence , or , as a last resort , to appeal for clemency . #% Evidently , a stable and permanent democracy is a precondition for eventual membership of the EU . #% I had difficulty in finding any of it that made sense in English ! #% They are predicting the answer before identifying the effects of implementing the solution . #% I thank those shadow rapporteurs on the main report and on my opinion for their full cooperation . #% It seems to me that what we can do tomorrow in the vote is to take a few more steps forward to achieve a little bit more in terms of benefit to the environment . #% The toxic fungus spray used to kill the coca has been found to have caused fever in local people , to kill cattle and fish and it has been shown to attack the immune system of humans with effects up to and including death . #% The beginning of a new financial perspective offers a significant opportunity for starting a rolling programme for assessing the performance of EU activities . #% I wish you well in getting all Member States together and in getting a proper contingency plan in place , Commissioner . #% The Council did not really like this idea anyway . #% In the United Kingdom , structural funding for counties such as Cornwall , which I represent and which has recently been granted Objective 1 status , faces a twin threat from government indolence on this directive and from government incompetence and meanness . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , if I may take this opportunity , speaking on behalf of Her Majesty 's Government , I want to respond to Mr Verhofstadt who , as ever , has missed the point and who , as ever , is facing in the wrong direction . #% If the EU were genuine about this sort of issue , it would adopt the position taken by the United Kingdom and ban pair trawling . #% The conclusion of an ambitious FTA is expected to boost bilateral trade by EUR 160 billion by 2015 , with key sectors seeing as much as a 30 % increase in bilateral foreign direct investment . #% That was in the report I referred to before . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I am delighted to congratulate Parliament 's two rapporteurs , Mrs Gál and Mrs Kósáné Kovács , for the excellent work that they have done , and also to congratulate Commissioner Frattini for the forceful way in which he has supported this exercise . #% 
That we have found unacceptable . #% Financial institutions will also be less forthcoming with capital investment as returns will be minimal and not guaranteed , leading to exactly the opposite of what is intended . #% The chair of the committee responsible would have to take account of any such agreement when ruling on the final responsibility for different parts of the text . #% Mr President , as Commissioner Pinheiro will be well aware , there are many stories coming from South Africa of bureaucracy , confusion , delays and , indeed , of missed opportunities in our dealings with NGOs in that country . #% What do we have to be so pleased and proud about ? #% In conclusion , this deal could have been even better had colleagues on that side of the House stood firmer in conciliation . #% We must give full support to the peace process , but we must recognise , as Mr Pflüger and others have said , that unfortunately , in a civil conflict like this , a lot of people are involved . #% It is fashionable at this time to pretend there is a long queue of countries wanting to join this place . #% The task of the shadow rapporteurs has been relatively easy because we have agreed with a lot of the content and we have been looking for ways to further improve the direction of his text . #% If you do not learn from history , you are doomed to repeat it . #% Meanwhile we are looking forward to the opinion of the Croatian Constitutional Court on the Istrian statute . #% Thirdly , in security policy , where we have the greatest difficulty , we have to ask the questions : will Europe have the military capability ? #% It is certainly not wanted by the British people , nor , I believe , is it wanted by many of the citizens in the rest of Europe . #% As a member of the Future of Europe Convention , I do hope , indeed I might even anticipate , that at the conclusion of the work that we shall be doing , it may well be that the protection of the private citizen and the interests of the private citizen , both in terms of the work of the Ombudsman - which I highly value and respect - and also in connection with data protection issues , will be spelled out very clearly as something in need of development in the future . #% I am pleased that my group has been able to sign all the compromise amendments , with the exception of Compromise Amendment No 25 . #% It has not put an end to the catastrophic humanitarian situation , but intensified it . #% Finally , on your recent visit to Britain , Commissioner , I would congratulate you . #% But with this increasing trade we need basic standards to guarantee human health , and safety standards on the issues of donation , procurement , compensation and consent . #% That is why the role of human rights defenders in the world is vital . #% It is a sign of environmental progress and achievement that air quality now is better than it has been for centuries . #% I submit that we should organize our affairs better and either allow a certain amount of time in the morning session for those colleagues who will run over - as I am doing - or start the voting later . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Wiebenga , on his report , which gets to the heart of the problem we are facing at the moment : temporary protection for people in the most difficult circumstances . #% Now I could go on but we would be here for some time . #% Finally , I very much welcome , too , Mr Duisenberg ' s taking up of a point in the report about the need to reduce the costs of cross-border payments , particularly for smaller payments which affect individual members . #% Everyone has to agree to a conclusion like this and any one person can wreck it . #% It is important also with derogations on minimum daily rest periods that we still have adequate rest for doctors . #% A less high profile exception that is important economically is the right of reverse engineering of computer software . #% This is why the Council and the Member States must work for the universal ratification of the main human rights instruments available to all countries , in particular , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural rights , the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women , the Convention on the Rights of the Child , already mentioned , the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination and the extremely important Convention against Torture . #% Mr President , the ELDR Group has always been quite critical in the past of the somewhat incoherent and arbitrary nature of previous annual programmes . #% There is also the problem raised by Tories like Douglas Hurd in the Lords regarding the problems it might pose for the settlement of international disputes , although that concern is mitigated to some extent by the residual power of the UN Security Council to prevent a prosecution in the interests of international peace and security . #% We can only call for European citizens to have more rights if all their rights are upheld irrespective of origin and without discrimination . #% You know when Mugabe is worried : he starts to panic . #% While we must be ever watchful of the civil liberties of our citizens , we must ensure that human rights legislation does not intrude excessively into operational areas which affect our ability to protect our law-abiding citizens and our democracies , particularly at a time of heightened threat . #% Certainly , with the additional pressures that are coming with an unprecedented enlargement , that emphasises the case . #% If we do not we are lost . #% I would urge those who are cautious about this to give it a try . #% However , it is a very complex area . #% Tens of millions of European citizens also share this view . #% In other words you have to be quite careful how you analyse the context of the particular directive that is involved . #% We have time to do something about that , and Mr Menrad 's report goes a long way towards reducing some of the fears and qualms . #% I welcome the packages of reforms that have been adopted and I also welcome the fact that the state security courts are to be abolished . #% It is not true to say , as some do , that those in the additional category necessarily stay for shorter periods or face less serious problems in their country of origin . #% We might need a Europe-wide review with a view to reinforcing those standards and we certainly need that in parallel with the European arrest warrant . #% Nearly 40 % of small and medium sized enterprises in the region have trading links with other EU Member States . #% I am surprised that some Members who are not here tonight have seen fit to attack that in an e-mail to all Members of Parliament . #% Buying from China means that 500 million Europeans will get an entry into a market of 1.3 billion Chinese . #% One press report of last weekend 's agreement to make a request to the US to close Guantánamo said : ` Ministers agreed that Europe can no longer ignore the extensive international criticism of the camp ' . #% She will never again use her arms or legs ; she is just three years old and her spinal cord was destroyed by Israeli shrapnel . #% This Saturday , all living Laureates will go to Oslo to commemorate 100 years of the Nobel Peace Prize - she will not be there . #% The other thing which the report mentions , which I would like to draw attention to , is that governments themselves can provide a model , and I therefore call on Member State governments to look at their own employment policies and identify how they might become better employers themselves . #% It is a guarantee against what we call in English ` stuffing ' . #% Let us stand back for a moment and consider the huge damage we do as we create a torrent of onerous and unnecessary legislation . #% The flu pandemic threat and the avian flu pandemic reality show just how important it is that we continue to work closely together -- Europe and the countries of the ACP -- for our mutual benefit . #% I am sorry , on this last occasion , to have to differ . #% In southern England eight saw mills have closed in the last three months . #% At least we would have an answer if we could say that we had an independent study and it will not work . #% The third innovation is to call for the European elections to be brought forward from June to May , to give more time for this procedure . #% Particularly in the current climate , after the French and the Dutch votes , people often see the Council and the Commission -- the Commission in particular -- as aloof from Parliament , the only democratically elected body that represents the electorate . #% It has now suffered 28 years of communist dictatorship , followed by fanatic Islamic theocracy , turning it into a pariah State as the Taliban harbours terrorists and executes thousands . #% We do not spend money for the sake of spending money . #% But this should not preclude other qualified organisations from having the possibility to do training , providing , of course , that all training is approved by the National Civil Aviation Authorities . #% The UK has a derogation from the Energy Products Directive which allows the country 's recreational boat owners to fill up their vessels with red diesel , taxed at 6.44 pence per litre . #% The Northern Dimension has ensured that we are able to focus on developments in the Baltic area , in terms of energy supplies , telecommunications , and economic assistance . #% To allow consumers and businesses the freedom to make that choice themselves is the most pragmatic and the most common-sense solution and this gives the maximum certainty both to business and to consumers . #% Mr President , I should like to ask whether the rapporteur would accept a verbal amendment to this amendment . #% But I call on the Palestinian Authority to crack down on Hamas , Islamic Jihad and al-Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades , otherwise Israel will be very reluctant to withdraw from the West Bank , which poses a much bigger challenge and is ultimately a much bigger prize . #% 
The European Union must live up to its leadership in establishing the Court by ensuring that all Member States fulfil their funding and legal obligations . #% Through such far-sighted yet practical policies , I believe we can release the natural industriousness and imagination of the people of the north-west and once more turn the region into a powerhouse of economic prosperity for Britain , Europe and the world . #% I recently spoke at a conference in the senate in Prague when this issue was being debated . #% Surely that is not usual in this House , but then perhaps we should expect anything . #% The evidence is there . #% Could he also confirm that the Presidency has acted entirely in conformity with Article J. 5 of the Treaty on European Union and , in addition , that the British government has adhered to its obligations under Article J. 5 , paragraph 4 , as a member of the Security Council ? #% At the outset , I should like to say how much I agree with the comments my colleague , Mrs Foster , made earlier . #% There needs to be a seamless thread , and I am delighted that Mrs Schreyer is here to address that issue today . #% If Mr Wolfowitz 's worst offence was giving his girlfriend a job , then it would hardly qualify as a minor error of judgement compared to the legendary levels of nepotism and corruption that the European Union has been guilty of over the years and the usual levels of corruption associated with the World Bank . #% Is chicken that is still in transit coming into the European Union , or has that also been stopped ? #% I would like to perhaps put a distinctive slant on this legislation . #% At the moment these countries rely heavily on customs duties which are collected from European imports and shared out between the customs union members . #% It would put in danger not only the workers involved but also the entire population of my region . #% Like Mr Fava , I remain optimistic that we will meet that deadline . #% I would like to hear whether the Commission is going to make any effort , or is making any effort , to try to establish whether or not there is a scorched earth policy . #% I would particularly like to thank Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for his unstinting work , his readiness to listen and his even-handed approach . #% I say that because a lot of people are concerned about the way in which this budget will be voted on Thursday . #% We know he has worked extremely hard on this report and very closely with others in this Chamber to ensure its success . #% Even this report , however , sometimes slips into discussing the grandiose and the theoretical . #% Secondly , what is the added value that it is going to bring us ? #% This is not necessarily synonymous with the Western European Union coming into the European Community 's institutions , but it is synonymous with an approach of greater cooperation . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Danish Presidency for the conclusions of the Brussels Summit in preparing the way for these ten countries to begin to assume obligations of membership by the beginning of 2004 . #% You will be aware that your employees assaulted two of our employees -- that is , employees of the United Kingdom Independence Party -- this morning , causing bodily injury . #% If you push on relentlessly with this Constitution , if you go on denying the peoples of Europe a say in their future , you are storing up very serious problems for our children . #% May I end with the hope that the world 's media will listen to them and will report their concerns and give far less attention to those tiny numbers of people who may be involved in violence , but who all too often drown out the legitimate concerns of the many thousands of peaceful , but passionate protestors . #% Above all , Europe must now respond to the new public mood which demands that the divisions of our world must be healed through a determined combating of poverty and disease and the removal of barriers that have stopped poorer countries trading in our markets . #% The Commission would interpret the creation of conflicts of interest as being detrimental to the Community and would thus refuse permission for such activities or impose conditions in order to prevent conflicts arising . #% We must now as a Parliament unite and tomorrow morning take the next step into conciliation , where we are going to have to work together with a view to achieving a common viewpoint to the way in which we are going to protect the environment of our common European home and preserve it for future generations . #% Serbia 's relationship with Kosovo is problematic but not insoluble . #% Commissioner , I would appreciate your answer on the Washington delegation because it is very odd that we do not get to see a number of these facts until we actually ask for them . #% Therefore , it fails to deal with a major potential obstacle to cross-border takeovers and restructuring . #% Ukraine , hopefully , will also be a Member State of the European Union one day . #% I wonder whether there is another problem with this report there . #% It is why we would prefer that there be parliamentary scrutiny in the question of Commission versus Council . #% We have taken forward efforts to mainstream human rights throughout the European Union 's work . #% The danger , it seemed to us , was that the European Union would have been left with absolutely nothing . #% For many years the Union has worked to give the poorest people in South Africa the best kind of support . #% So the report is balanced and I think can be welcomed . #% If the UK Presidency will not give a lead , our political group will . #% Mr President , on behalf of the committee , I should like to warmly welcome both reports and thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work . #% Hygiene standards in the UK are second to none , and the ban must be lifted across the EU , including France . #% We have mentioned two of the parallels between their situation and that of women similarly engaged in the agricultural sector and of the possibility of joint action on their parts . #% If we are looking for a common framework and a common approach , these are very key reference points which also help to send a signal from Member States that they , too , are concerned about these issues . #% I would just like to set out some pointers for that . #% With political will this could be achieved over the next ten years - I offer two years more than the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection . #% However , the national parliaments will have their say and there is a real chance that we will get more referendums than just in Ireland . #% I was very pleased that colleagues endorsed this report so soundly in the last plenary session . #% Maybe this is really what they are thinking . #% We have seen leaks purporting to be official documents . #% The pain is real , the pain is desperate , and that is why people have looked to us . #% Every MEP has the right to ask a supplementary question , and yet there seems to be no obligation on the person withdrawing the question to tell all the other Members that he has done so . #% We want equal rights of call back for Parliament and the Council - Parliament by an absolute majority , the Council by a qualified majority , as is the bottom line now when a matter goes back to the Council . #% The fundamental question , it seems to me , that faces this Parliament , the Commission and the Council is : What is Europe ? #% I would also like to congratulate the Commission on a welcome note of realism in this year 's annual economic report . #% I also feel that we need to look very carefully in this Directive at exactly how the process of experimentation will go in the future . #% Mr President , I wanted to ask a brief question about the European Patients ' Platform and to ask the two Commissioners whether they are happy about the degree of independence of those who represent patients . #% We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents , made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten 's report . #% Mr President , I want briefly to raise two issues regarding freedom of expression . #% I am sorry that is not possible , and I know Mrs Malliori will want to speak about this . #% President Musharraf actually met his commitment - as the Council said - to hold these elections . #% She always manages to steer between national positions and never loses sight of that corpus of food safety legislation which we are slowly bringing together . #% In the light of the votes on these amendments , could the Commission inform us whether those figures remain within the financial perspective ? #% For example , there is a supposedly closed uranium mine in the south of the Congo from which uranium is still being mined and exported , probably to Iran . #% Commissioner , yesterday I was reading a British paper whilst I was travelling to Strasbourg . #% Sub-Saharan Africa is short of one million health workers . #% It should be remembered that the most efficient form of government is the centralised dictatorship . #% 
I should therefore like to ask the Commission how it will ensure the EU supports and works with the UN in its efforts in Côte d'Ivoire and takes stronger action , over and above Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement , in respect of the situation there . #% It is therefore right that we should look , as this report does , at how we should adapt to that reality , that we should recognise it in the Treaty , that we should provide for better consultation and information of the regions , that we should make fuller use of Article 203 of the Treaty where appropriate , and that we should give proper consideration to the views of the Committee of the Regions . #% It is all very well to say that ` equal ' must mean equal pay , but should all workers doing the same job get the same pay across the EU ? #% Moving swiftly to secure a European air safety agency and concluding a new Eurocontrol convention are ready examples of what might be done to clear the clouds that obscure Europe 's aerospace sector . #% We know we could provide a more rapid and effective service if Member States could provide an equally committed response in replying to requests for information and explanation . #% In fact , quite a lot of things have been done in the recent past . #% Unless we give greater priority to Zimbabwe , the Mugabe regime will stagger on until the point where Zimbabwe fails completely , unable to revive itself without immense international assistance . #% By avoiding quantifying significant negative annual real growth in the definition of exceptional and temporary circumstances , whose recognition allows temporary suspension of the obligation of compliance with the budget deficit criterion , the Commission refused to deprive Member States of the required budget flexibility to act promptly and effectively against significantly declining growth . #% To disagree with some people opposite , it may not look good in the newspapers but the best time - indeed the only time - to make restructuring plans is when you are strong . #% Next summer when we face Europe 's citizens in elections we could have a Parliament with its own House in order , its Members across Europe treated and respected equally and on a transparent basis , or we could continue with the current disgraceful mix and muddle which leaves us all open to ridicule . #% This evening I will speak on the Malangré report as Socialist Group shadow . #% This has led to a tragic loss of moral authority and reputation for the United States . #% Therefore , there are horrific cases of animal cruelty and far too many cases of animals -- living creatures -- simply being treated like so many nuts and bolts on a manufacturing production line . #% Such an over-interpretation would damage not only the right of public access to documents , but also the genuine purpose of data protection and the performance of the duties of the Data Protection Supervisor . #% Of course it is . #% I do not think that President Klaus will be able to hold out , I hope that he does ; he is a fine and brave man . #% In this context I am constantly reminded by my constituents that those most affected are the small and independent financial advisers , the net effect being that business is becoming steadily concentrated in the hands of larger and larger firms . #% I do hope that Members will support this motion , because this is something we can actually change for the better . #% The contagion of cooperation and social partnership has spread to Britain . #% There has been no regression on the status quo : all persons covered by social security schemes are now included -- not just paid workers . #% There is a demonstration taking place by our staff . #% We have already heard from Mrs Madeira about the fatalities which take place in Portugal itself and I would like to remind all of you that every six minutes across the world one woman dies from an illegal , unsafe abortion . #% So at this time when we are talking about communications policy , you can perhaps translate into the Bureau minutes the same degree of clarity , lucidity and transparency that this Parliament is trying to instil into the European Central Bank . #% Mr Pérez Álvarez has spent a long time discussing health and safety in this Parliament . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , there is not much enthusiasm for tackling global warming at the moment , rather widespread public scepticism . #% It has just 90 inspectors covering the globe and I ask the presidency to look carefully at that to see how this corner of Ireland , with its EU-wide implications , can be made more effective . #% In referring to the Costa Neves Report , I should like , first of all , to congratulate the rapporteur on having focused on the progress report , on what had been done in terms of following up on the Joint Council/Parliament Declaration at the end of last year which has shown its worth in our budgetary procedure . #% We expect the European Council now to show the political will to bring the IGC to a quick and successful conclusion and to draft the durable , efficient and effective system of democratic government that we need to strengthen the Union and its place in world affairs . #% Can I begin by being self-critical of this Parliament . #% I believe that it is not necessary to conduct a risk assessment every time it is proposed to use a ladder . #% That was the subject of the extensive debate that Parliament had on Monday . #% We think it is very valuable , so I would certainly be concerned if anything happened to detract from the programme and make it more difficult for certain Member States to take part in it . #% I am afraid that after reading the Commission Communication , I finished with not much more of an idea as to how far Europe had actually come towards the learning society , and which direction we wished to go . #% Could I suggest that , when the Vice-Presidents come to this particular point , they should be looking at the US Congress , which does ensure the security of people going into the building , but then allows them to flow freely through it . #% I wish that MEPs and pressure groups that argue the need so strongly to defend ethical principles were equally vocal in their defence of the sick and the vulnerable , like my young constituent Zain Hashmi , who this week was able with his parents to get permission to utilise these new technologies to protect his life and safeguard his future . #% Mr President , I was delighted to hear the report from the Council on the activities in the European Conference . #% Bush has said he will not do that and there is virtually zero support for it in the Senate anyway . #% We have been told that the Conference of Presidents has not had time to consider this in full because the matter is still being examined by the meeting of secretaries-general of political groups with the deputy Secretary-General of the European Parliament . #% deputising for the author . - The allegation is that a British company , BAE Systems , corruptly paid bribes in order to win a competitive advantage over other European defence contractors in Saudi Arabia and that an independent investigation of this behaviour has been stopped by the UK Government . #% This is a grave problem which be traced directly back to the leadership . #% I hope , therefore , that the Council will take on board many of the issues which have been raised in this Parliament , both in committee and in plenary regarding such measures . #% Since the value of the reassured risk was collected in banks in the country where the risk was to be covered , it just collected money that did nothing : dead cash , if you like . #% in writing . - The ECR Group is wholeheartedly supportive of the inclusion and integration of the Roma people within Member States and the European Union . #% He is a vile despot and we must cease all links with him and his regime . #% Will he commit this Parliament , this Union , and this Commission to do more as well . #% This agreement with China also applies to vessels flying the flags of third countries but owned or operated by a shipping company of China or a Member State of the EU . #% They have our sympathy and support in tackling the many problems they face : pollutants , locusts and AIDS , to name but three . #% Water is the most vital of all resources : life is impossible without it . #% The Council has been absent from this debate on discharge . #% When this report first appeared it seemed to cover a small technical matter , but this is in fact a small technical matter with the ability to make a huge difference . #% We look forward to hearing the Commissioner 's reply on Amendment No 92 . #% I realise there is little to be done at this stage , but unfortunately feel my position will be justified by future events . #% This report is an important step in achieving that and I can assure the rapporteur that he will have the full support of the ELDR Group in this House . #% I welcome the commitment of the Commissioner to look at all these and other factors . #% Our reaction to natural disasters , such as the devastation we saw in Italy , must go beyond the realm of politics . #% When I came for this debate at 3 o'clock I was told it would be taking place later , towards 5 o'clock . #% We have a great opportunity to tie up this decision quickly , a mere three months after Parliament first debated this revised document . #% To be fair , there is much that is sensible in this report . #% Mr President , in today ' s Financial Times the Secretary-General of UNCTAD reiterated that there remains persistent bias against developing countries in the multilateral trading system . #% Mr Salafranca talked about credibility , and our credibility as a Parliament is at stake here if we do not understand the issues that we are dealing with . #% Mr President , I am sure that you and the whole House will join me in expressing our distress and condolences with regard to the 21 Albanians who lost their lives when their boat was shipwrecked recently near Vlora , off the Albanian coast . #% Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes . #% Mr President , first of all , let me join the rapporteur in welcoming this report from the Commission . #% But the big question for us is whether it will be possible to show that the European Union , and the other major parties to the Protocol , are prepared to take decisions without the United States . #% We need far greater clarity . #% What is also needed , as the Czechs pointed out , is enlightened imagination and political courage . #% 
The proposal addresses public concern that the current welfare standards for chickens kept for meat are too low . #% In fact , I hope you are all very proud of yourselves because what you have done is you have taken the littlest boy in the playground , got him into the corner and given him a good kicking . #% Mr President , I have listened with great interest to the Commissioner 's statement on the enlargement countries . #% Commissioner , I have some very simple questions for you , which require just a ` yes ' or ` no ' answer in each case . #% Before we do that , we have a duty to ensure that those rules are necessary , will work to enhance European business 's rights and opportunities , and will serve their part in the opening up of global markets in our fight to improve employment and to create a level playing field . #% If these conditions are not fulfilled , then we should be prepared to call for a second postponement of the elections . #% There is one unusual procedure - the House has voted already on the criteria for the site of the European Food Safety Authority . #% The life-cycle of elvers is still not properly understood with gluts and shortages alternating in a not fully understood pattern . #% I hope we will hear from her too . #% I think the sooner this is on the Internet , the better . #% Many would argue that government procurement has little or nothing to do with traditional matters of trade , tariffs and quotas , and that it is an unacceptable area for negotiations at the WTO , because subjecting government procurement at the national , local or regional level to one-size-fits-all rules at a global level on how taxpayers ' funds are spent I think destroys citizens ' reasonable expectations that they should have a level of democratic accountability over how their money is spent . #% I take the rapporteur 's point that this is not simply a minimal change , that the issues at stake are technical and complex . #% Secondly , I would like to contrast the human rights situation in the authoritarian Communist dictatorship of China with the vigorous and free democracy of Taiwan . #% The Commission recognises that appointment to some posts could constitute - or appear to constitute - a conflict of interest . #% What has that done ? #% In addition , we will enthusiastically try to implement the new loan guarantee scheme , ELISE , in my area . #% The report provides an overview of EU action in the key international organisations : the United Nations Commission for Human Rights and the UN General Assembly Third Committee , the OSCE and the Council of Europe . #% However , we would also wish to go further in a different direction . #% I would like to deal with one or two of the specific points that have been raised . #% Neighbours need to get to know each other ; next door is only a footstep away . #% Israel should understand that this is not the time to do that . #% We are in a better place there . #% Mr Prodi in his address to this Parliament some time ago gave a strong commitment to combating fraud and the misuse of public money . #% You could do that today for us . #% It follows a chaotic vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism when there was real doubt about the correct result . #% Although Safe Action in Europe is no longer with us in body it is still with us in spirit . #% It also appears discriminatory that the Prime Minister 's daughter , Marina Mahathir , has not , on the other hand , been targeted by the authorities although she too has been a critic of the government from time to time . #% I do not want to dwell on the experience of my own constituents in Greece , but I will just start by saying that there was relief that the appeal court in Greece recognised the planespotters ' innocence : so the justice system did work in the end and we are all very grateful for that . #% Poor people live in the short term , in a day-today struggle to put food on the table . #% We have seen this in the last few days at Evian with the G8 and at the Nato ministerial meeting in Madrid . #% It wanted to keep the same blocking minority in an enlarged Union , which would have made decision-taking even more difficult . #% Too often , European Union legislation and regulation have effects which run directly counter to the wider aspiration of competitiveness . #% We need issuer choice , otherwise we will have the same problems we have had with the existing prospectus directive . #% The Union should be involved in efforts to resolve the differences between the Kurdish parties and helping to rebuild the economy . #% This applies also to the question of a Code of Conduct for high level officials because in the Commission over the last few years there has indeed been lax management in internal organisation as was underlined by the Wise Men 's report . #% We campaign for a Europe that once again respects the political , economic and cultural diversities of all the individual nations and their right to democratic self government . #% Finally , we must take more effective action in the field of small arms and light weapons ; and if that is to be achieved , I believe it has to be moved into the first pillar . #% I am intrigued to see Commissioner Lamy here this afternoon . #% How we deal with the dispossessed is an issue for society as a whole , not just for governments . #% The other area of concern is around procurement . #% We must allow the voice of small and medium-sized businesses to be heard . #% There have already been some reports of children dying from malnutrition , particularly in the Bulawayo area . #% I am motivated to do so because the shock waves and repercussions of what is happening in Zimbabwe have reached even my constituency in the in Yorkshire in the North of England in a number of ways in the last couple of weeks . #% The Socialist Group will also be monitoring the social component of enlargement , because we must make sure that enlargement makes things better for people and not worse . #% If we are to take it seriously it will radically reform the European Union agenda , which will make it a far more relevant and exciting one than people find at present . #% I have spent most of my life in merchant banking , albeit not retail banking , and I have to say I do not regard it as the business of politicians to come between a consumer , or a lender , and a borrower . #% The parallel that the Minister makes as a 21st century equivalent of slavery may be true on one hand , but there is also another angle on it . #% One final point , the farmers will need finance to make sure they can implement the schemes and I hope that some thought is being given to that . #% Mr President , may I first pay credit to my colleague , Mr Heaton-Harris , for the initial work he did in drafting this report before he moved to another committee . #% This is about accountability and the proper functioning of democracy , where we as a Parliament are taking our responsibility in the budgetary process , using the reserve on a judicious basis to get the information that we need to be able to carry out our job effectively . #% Mr President , I rise with a heavy heart because it is never a pleasant duty to speak about human rights abuses . #% There are also data protection worries , which is why Parliament wanted to extend the provisions on erasing data to include , for instance , those who obtain any kind of legal status to remain in a Member State even if not full refugee status . #% However , the report recognises the need for any reform of social systems to be non-regressive and to meet essential needs : a core income is essential to that goal . #% The so-called ` war ' on terror has been used by some to rework international law and defy international conventions on human rights and the treatment of those detained ( on suspicion , not proof ) without trial or any due process . #% The rapporteur proposes a very comprehensive system of labelling when perfumes and aromas are present in products , even in tiny amounts . #% Indeed , at the very heart of the matter , the concept of standard market size was a concept contributed to the debate by the PSE group . #% This is important and should be supported . #% I can not overemphasise the need for proper building insulation and , as my colleague just said , the need to stop the waste of energy in these enormous slab blocks in the Eastern European countries that are now in the European Union . #% Many of them are not really concerned about the extension of qualified majority voting , important as that is , but they are anxious for progress on citizens ' rights , progress on free movement , progress towards a real integrated Europe where people know and understand their rights and responsibilities . #% Another example can be found in Harlow , Essex - in my constituency - where we have five separate credit unions , cooperatives that provide money and loan finance which is otherwise unavailable to people on low incomes and with poor credit records . #% However , I am informed that this law still gives the Greek Government the power to confiscate vehicles in this situation . #% Let us not forget that there are problems in other categories also . #% However , we saw on 3 September the declaration of a unilateral ceasefire by the Maoist rebels and the response by the Seven-Party Alliance to try to start at the political level a process to resolve the armed conflict . #% It has been a delight to work with Minister Roche in particular . #% If a document is excepted , or parts of the document are excepted , those parts of the document which are not excepted will be made public , and the exceptions will only apply for a limited maximum of thirty years , except in some cases . #% From the macro point of view it must be recognized that business has gone global during the time that we have been trying to achieve harmonized audit standards . #% 
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his careful , accurate and detailed analysis of this case . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to say that we supported approval of the interinstitutional agreement as an essential building block in re-establishing the credibility of the European Union in how it relates to fraud and deals with allegations of fraud . #% Targets have been set and incentives for more efficient vans will hopefully kick-start an innovation drive across the industry . #% We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms , these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously . #% He ordered the kidnappings because he thought he might get away with it . #% Parliament should not give its approval to practices deemed illegal by the European Court of Justice and disporportionate by the Commission . #% That is the point that we have to remember time and time again when it comes to agricultural matters . #% We might not have electrical boats now , but we could in the future . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I am broadly in agreement with the paper presented by the Commission and most certainly with the report by my colleague Mrs Heinisch and the amendments she has recommended . #% We must all accept the fact , for example , that the fastest growing source of global warming gases is the transport sector . #% I congratulate the EU Heads of Government for having brought asylum into the Community competence and setting a progressive agenda at Tampere . #% It is beholden on the European Union to take seriously its responsibilities for Turkey and ensure that Turkey feels part of the European family . #% Gold plating is a phenomenon which affects every Member State to a greater or lesser extent . #% Cooking oil is seen to be a problem after the dioxin scandals of recent years . #% I know that the people of Southampton , and the port workers of that city , would wish to associate themselves with the condolences expressed to the families of the people killed and to those injured in the awful accident at Saint-Nazaire . #% In the case of Moldova and Georgia , it should be encouraged to withdraw its troops . #% First is the general outlook . #% It is their belief that ` a direct link between some aspect of the tax system and the financing of the European Union ' would make EU citizenship more balanced . #% I am against Amendment Nos 1 , 44 and 45 , as they include references to taxation . #% It is hard to escape the idea that this is Beijing 's attempt to break the will of the Uyghur separatists . #% My Group can accept the common position . #% Structural funding must be more than a simple transfer of resources from the more prosperous Member States to the less prosperous ones - if that were all it is , this could be done simply by adjusting budget contributions and rebates . #% Thirdly , given the quarter to half a million Taiwanese immigrants in Shanghai alone who regularly travel between China and Taiwan , it is hard to imagine that the Chinese would take any risks of them bringing in diseases from Taiwan . #% I have to say that the decision taken in principle yesterday , particularly by the Christian Democrats , to rubber-stamp this decision , brings this House into disrepute . #% Above all , that means giving jobs and hope to young people . #% Providing protective equipment , such as sunglasses , hats , or sun tan cream , and making sure that they wear them ? #% It is about time that we in this House said that we have had enough of it all . #% What we need is a clearer definition of what we want ! #% Pension assets could be around 21 % larger across the European Union if we had been using the prudent investor principle already . #% In the restaurants there is supposed to be a no-smoking area . #% Please bear that in mind . #% Commissioner Pinheiro will recall that many of us expressed some reservations about the Green Paper but we very much welcome the consultation that has taken place and the opportunity for dialogue since the publication of the Green Paper . #% The report also points out the importance of the objective of global disarmament , the Pact for Stability and welcomes the draft EU code of conduct on the arms trade . #% Finally I would say that all too often government intervention can get in the way and make companies less competitive . #% We would all do well to learn the lessons that Solidarity 's history teaches us . #% People in my region do not want to see that occurring . #% But let us look at one small issue and how this report could affect it : let us take a look at ink-jet printer cartridges , probably one of the most widely used products in the world . #% We know what lobby it is that stops us doing this on alcohol , which stops us having the labelling that is necessary . #% In 1970 the railways had a 10 % share of the passenger market , today just 6 % . #% Amendment No 108 , among others , is important in that respect . #% For instance I would like to see a specific directive on needlestick injuries . #% We have done that with a good grace . #% We have asked Members of Parliament to volunteer to follow budget lines . #% There might be a good case for having a separate directive on these two issues but I would ask the Commission to carry out a further study on the possible consequences of carrier pre-selection . #% This is a delicate job ; a job that needs to change things for the better and she is simply not experienced enough . #% We all know in this Chamber and in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport that the work of the European Union must be carried out not only inside the institutions but also by people outside . #% In the past decade relations with China have developed in a positive way , particularly in respect of the maritime sector , with the majority of Member States signing bilateral agreements with the Chinese . #% So how have we tried to resolve that at European level ? #% Would the President-in-Office be prepared at least to convey to his Home Office colleagues my request that an amnesty be granted to such couples , at least where it is recognised that there is a genuine and subsisting relationship , and that the requirement to travel to the country of origin in order to apply for spousal residence be waived ? #% The democratic deficit in open co-ordination is also becoming even clearer . #% I want to particularly praise Paragraph 14 , where she is asking the Commission to examine unfair practices and also Paragraph 22 which is recognising the need for increased consistency between national aid schemes , Union aid schemes and competition policy . #% We want the economic benefits of tourism , but we need investment in bread-winner jobs as well . #% On this basis , therefore , the attempt in this report to circumscribe or better define the competences of the Community - however well motivated - breaches our fundamental view of how nation-states should work together . #% We will hope together for progress . #% Will you agree with me , Commissioner , that if that happened it would be a major blow to attempts to balance flexibility and security and would damage the balanced pursuit of Lisbon ? #% So it is good that something is actually happening , it is good that there has been a statement , but let us get on with it . #% I would also say that in these dangerous times when new forces have emerged that threaten the very nature of our free societies , we need more solidarity among the democracies and less EU self promotion . #% Great Britain is an island with its own extensive natural and architectural heritage . #% Mr President-in-Office , you have a lot to do . #% Some governments -- perhaps the Italians , the Irish , and certainly some of the Scandinavian ones -- were putting a spanner in the works and stalling on this . #% Let us , let Shell , let every Member State who trades in oil act now to save the life of Batom Mitee , of the thirty others arrested with him , and of all oppressed Nigerian people who they represent . #% In judging the conflicting amendments - I as a mere politician have in general put my trust in the Commission 's air quality experts . #% That is an unsustainable position and , politically , we should push the Member States harder and harder on this . #% I am confident that we can do that . #% Can you confirm that probationary periods , as set out in your White Paper , have been included in the contracts for the new appointments , how long those periods are and that systematic assessments of performance are included in those appointments ? #% But where the Santer Commission was prepared to go where angels feared to tread , this Commission has been cowering behind its barricades , frightened to take on the Member States on this issue and , in so doing , failing in its responsibilities to defend the Treaties . #% 
Uzbekistan has no historic traditions of democracy or good governance , having been ruled in the distant past by Khanates , followed by Tsarists and Soviet Russia , only to find itself unexpectedly a sovereign state in 1991 , following the disintegration of the Soviet Union . #% I am a sceptic rather than an opponent of genetically modified crops . #% What we need now is a sensible way out of this situation . #% Second , the report proposes that within Parliament we have a joint meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs and the Conference of Presidents of this House to make a global evaluation prior to the debate in plenary and to declare the process of hearings closed . #% Do something ! #% When I see amendments put down and signed in the names of both Mr Liese and Mr Nisticò , I know that this is a measure where there has been enormous effort to bring about a meeting of minds and views . #% I remind the Council and Commission that two weeks ago this Parliament voted for mandatory social and environmental reporting by European enterprises on their global supply chain , as a first step towards establishing a binding framework for corporate accountability . #% There are therefore three points which we should include in our message to the incoming parliament and the incoming administration of the European Union . #% I wonder how many colleagues who have contributed to this debate this evening have actually bothered to read the new package that regulates electronic communications . #% There had been lobbying from the Turkish side not to go , on the grounds that this was a sensitive time in Turkey . #% In September 2009 , I asked Commissioner Andor what specific measures he would introduce to assist SMEs , following my similar request of him when he spoke to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on taking up the portfolio . #% The poor Commissioner has spent more than half an hour on this section and I suggest we now move on to the third part of question time . #% It respects the Rules of Procedure and it respects what the majority in this House wants . #% This is not a parliamentary democracy . #% The PPE-DE Group amendment to the report demanded that the EU should be guaranteed a seat in the UN Security Council . #% Some of this report contradicted the very workable proposals of the Commission and as such made little sense . #% My congratulations go to all of those concerned in the work to date . #% However , as we realised that this would affect existing groups in the House just for the May part-session , there is a provision that allows existing groups to continue as they are until the elections , irrespective of this rule change . #% That is the real issue which we should be debating today . #% The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue , subsidies , interest received , etc. , with a reference simply to volume of sales . #% What was their response and does their response indicate that they will also respond to these proposals he has put before us ? #% As an MEP representing London , I obviously have concerns about the way that this report may affect the very successful congestion charge scheme that has been operating in London for the past year or so . #% It is not only about who will regulate the regulator but why we need to regulate the regulator . #% Handing the EU control of asylum and immigration policy would be deeply inimical to our national interest and would potentially expose us to greater risks from terrorism and organised crime . #% We have seen a new process of making paper from straw , again using much more environmentally friendly chemicals . #% The first suggestion is that the proposals for the spending programme with regard to research on security should be funded by the Member States at European level , but outside the Seventh Framework Programme . #% So the link is already there . #% Retaining a separate urban community initiative would allow innovative and trans-national urban projects to be maintained as well as aid to the majority of people who live in particular in small and medium-sized towns . #% The Israeli election was widely regarded as a referendum on unilateral action to establish permanent borders . #% We have a commitment from the main European companies in this sector . #% This is slightly off-piste if you are going to talk about being on the ground or on the snow . #% Unless we address that question then the whole issue of a Common Foreign and Security Policy and a European defence identity is no more than a day-dream . #% Madam President , this is not only a crisis for British farmers , it is a crisis for French farmers as well . #% There is no evidence whatsoever that either of those things will happen , and it would be helpful if the job creation facet inherent in this directive were properly communicated . #% I recognise that he has reiterated what he said in a very full statement to the Committee on Petitions . #% Ship owners and the nations that have these ships flagged in those countries should be monitored elsewhere rather than by European countries . #% Our strategy has to be to work well with Latin America and with Asia and apply the same principles which are at the heart of our development programme . #% It was in many ways for me a dream come true : I was fresh from coordinating the ` yes ' campaign in Britain in the referendum on our membership of the European Community in 1975 . #% We want to see an end to the advantages inherited by some of the old state monopolies . #% It can and must forcefully tackle race discrimination and xenophobia making the EU a world leader in the celebration of multicultural and ethnic diversity . #% We should also add our condolences not only to his family , but also to all the families of those who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan . #% If we are serious as a parliament , even those amongst us who support the idea of 10 % of the seats being elected in this way , we should take this particular recital out of the text because it actually contradicts the facts and our proposals . #% The former Director-General for Administration Jean Feidt should carry responsibility for that deplorable situation . #% Criticism has been made of the supply of material to the Iraqis . #% If we are to say that the fact that someone is a Member of the European Parliament exempts him from this particular law in Germany , to which everyone else in Germany will be subject , we would be doing the European Parliament no service at all . #% Thirdly , it also shows us that NATO works well , and indeed works best , when the United States is focused and gives clear leadership . #% That being said , there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved . #% Mr President , Mr van den Bos is to be congratulated on his work , but the trouble with a wide-ranging report like this is that it eventually includes everyone 's pet hobby-horse and the key messages may be obscured . #% The heroine of this book is a raven-haired , stunningly good-looking Member of the European Parliament of indeterminate nationality who single-handedly takes on the evil chemical industry . #% Mr President , I want to speak briefly about an amendment I have tabled to the Turchi report on trans-European networks . #% Yet , when they turn to Europe , they find a Union which has devoted years to this institutional wrangling . #% One of our concerns relates to the new products the Commission proposes to add to the GSP system . #% In the Committee on Petitions we have a large number of petitions which relate to the particular directives concerned in this important report . #% In particular , have European funding , structural funds , etc. never been used ? #% Mr President , once again over the past year the EU has been accused of failing in its commitment to human rights by refusing to effectively use human rights clauses in trade and cooperation agreements . #% There is now wider agreement about the desirability of ISAF broadening its mandate beyond Kabul . #% I can not see that regulations framed in this way benefit anybody . #% The developments in Asia have not stopped and Japan , in particular , is in difficulty and I predict its difficulties will increase . #% This particular form of preventive treatment can be singled out because , unlike conventional methods of protection , it allows women to take responsibility for its use . #% Madam President , I just wanted to correct what Mr Posselt said . #% Now , two observations . #% If Iran is serious about developing better relationships with the West , it ought to put pressure on those groups to release those soldiers . #% Finally , will he consider the possibility of a public inquiry into the way this matter has been handled ? #% Although no conclusion could be reached in a single day , I can tell you that they have set up a working party between the chairmen and intend to meet again and to come up with a conclusion . #% Is there going to be a comparable programme in the future ? #% Mr President , the essential message of this splendid report , which the Liberal Group strongly supports , the central message really is that national parliaments could , and should , contribute more to the political system of the European Union . #% 
Although it was addressed to you , the letter was in fact in response to a letter from me . #% We must never underestimate the civil liberties implications to which Baroness Ludford has rightly alerted this House . #% The conflict has its origin in the fact that although the Sultanate of Aceh was never technically incorporated into the Dutch East Indies it was one of the territories handed over by Holland to Indonesia in 1949 , following the UN-sponsored talks between Indonesia and the former colonial power . #% Would one not criticise this kind of situation in , let us say , Zimbabwe or some other part of the world , if it arose there ? #% South Africa should be at the forefront of international efforts to pressure the Mugabe regime into making democratic concessions , but I am afraid quiet diplomacy by President Mbeke has achieved nothing tangible . #% We now seem to have a balance where the cost will reflect the actual cost of those inspections , but it is possible that there will be loopholes , particularly in the way that some countries define ` small operators ' . #% Our relations will depend on fundamental progress in the areas of human rights and illegal immigration , weapons of mass destruction , in particular the country 's nuclear weapons programme , drugs , the Middle East , Afghanistan and the battle against terrorism . #% We are all members of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs ; we have adopted a position and we have not rushed into it just because we have been bullied and lobbied on the Internet and via the fax machines that are in all our offices . #% Secondly , the left-wing composition of the proposed Commission is wholly contrary to the views of Europe ' s voters as shown in June . #% We can not expect to develop fully rounded and responsible individuals if they are not encouraged to be constructive and articulate about this major component of their lives . #% It is , therefore , a better deal than full membership . #% The Conservative delegation regards many of the ideas in the report as centralising , syndicalist , unnecessary and backward-looking . #% However , I would call on everyone here to recognise the importance of allowing time for change . #% So we have to watch who we support and make sure the labels really are ethical . #% At the moment , Member States to a degree are still posturing . #% The optimists say no , because 95 % of the draft Constitution has not been challenged and has virtually been agreed though I would like to see the text of the final versions of these articles that have virtually been agreed at the IGC . #% Secondly , will you comment on the position of the British Government where the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has said it will take three to five years before it reports on this ? #% However , what we have is a typical piece of EU legislation : intrusive , prescriptive , vastly expensive . #% There is much to commend this resolution , and with careful thought , greater progress can be expected against the problems of the financial crisis . #% The series of trialogue meetings , discussions between the Council , the Commission and Parliament , took place from January to March 2001 . #% That date has been set by the Commission with the agreement of the Spanish authorities and Minas de Almadén in order to leave enough time to reorganise and restructure that company , and I think it deserves all of our support . #% All the usual items listed as human rights - including the right to life , freedoms of conscience , religion , speech and private life , democratic rights , pluralism , the rule of law - are included and supported by me and those who think like me . #% First of all , as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out , it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle . #% Now we see a resurgence of Chinese interest in many parts of Africa , including Zimbabwe . #% These drugs distort and damage sport , the health of individual competitors and the example set to young people , who look up to sporting heroes as role models . #% In a slightly shock reversal of the normal roles within the PPE-DE Group , I found that the rest of my Group were more cautious about the idea of further regulation than I was : usually I am the one in my Group arguing for a more deregulatory approach . #% Do you think that it should be given operational powers to follow drug traffickers moving across Europe ? #% We must demand Burma 's exclusion from ASEM until it complies with the demands of the international community . #% We need a radical and fundamental revision of trade policy so that this genuinely can be a development round worthy of the name . #% Madam President , can I say we have made enormous progress over the last three years in terms of relations with the DPRK . #% Finally , I hope the whole House will thank Mr Cabrol for pursuing his case . #% We have to have Europol ; we have to have the fatally flawed European arrest warrant . #% The Commission has made one major omission in not making any mention of nuclear energy in this report . #% It is important , therefore , that people are absolutely certain when they buy a product imported from outside the European Union that those high standards of organic production have been met . #% In view of what the President said earlier , I must declare an interest , in that I had dinner with the President-inOffice last night . #% Madam President , I want to congratulate Commissioner Kinnock on the statement he has just made . #% And it wants to revert , not even to what is currently in the Treaty , but to something that is worse than the current Treaties as regards the powers of the European Parliament . #% Mr President , I also wish to add my congratulations to Mrs Randzio-Plath for the work on this report , which has been difficult at times . #% Indeed until recently the growth projections of both the Commission and the OECD suggested we could still possibly complete that task of getting millions of people back to work by the year 2000 . #% Surely we too should be using the renegotiation of the GPA in Geneva to break down the WTO barriers which prevent Member States from implementing a privileged access measure for SMEs should they so wish . #% Opening up the telecoms market to competition has contributed a great impetus to growth and innovation in the UK and will do the same for Europe as a whole from next year . #% The Commission has suggested formal negotiations being launched before the end of next month . #% If that proves to be the case then I have misread the game . #% I can only say how thankful I am that Britain has not joined the euro ... #% I suspect my own analysis will be rather different from many we have heard so far this afternoon , but what is clear is that collapse offers us an opportunity to start a root-and-branch transformation of the WTO . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their presentations this morning . #% What we want you to do is to put some serious enforcement and simplification behind the existing internal market directives . #% We are proposing one amendment that will improve the proposal , which is to grant the political parties legal personality under European Union law . #% Clearly we are all concerned to ensure that the message that goes out of this Chamber is that the cease-fire has to apply to all sides in Kosovo . #% The fact that we have had no debate on these new ones , once again means that we will vote against them in the plenary . #% In the case of Eurodac , how do we know that these special searches were not unauthorised access by national agencies masquerading as searches on behalf of individuals checking their own data ? #% Fourthly , we want the Member States that have been a weak link in the system to train and recruit adequate numbers of port state control inspectors . #% For these reasons , Conservatives abstained on the final vote . #% We should bear in mind that public information is important if we are going to have public confidence , and the blue flag has gained that confidence : we should be careful not to damage it . #% Well , none of us want people coming into our houses . #% This report does just the opposite . #% For example , tons of in-transit duty-free goods are being confiscated from consumers . #% Like the rapporteur , the Liberal Democrats want to ensure that rapid progress is made , that we see the maximum benefits in the shortest possible period . #% We think this is a slightly complicated area which it would be useful to look at in rather more detail . #% Our policy , or resolution , is all about ending rejection , ending the concept of a scrap-heap , ending stigma where disability is concerned . #% Thanks are due to Commissioner Palacio and her staff for the crucial part they played at several points when it seemed we were at deadlock . #% The question is how we can achieve these objectives . #% No 425 which is empty has just voted in that vote . #% We have different definitions in several different directives . #% In June , the summit should set itself a rendezvous with a clear decision towards the end of 2007 , to establish a fresh intergovernmental conference with the purpose of modifying and improving the Treaty . #% The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union . #% 
As the House will know , I spent a great deal of time studying the reform process on behalf of the House last year and continued to follow it through the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% Mr President , I want to support the rapporteur against that attack from his own side . #% in writing . - I backed the Commission 's radio spectrum policy programme ( RSPP ) because I believe that all EU citizens should have access to a faster broadband connection by 2020 . #% Some of us suspect that the rescue packages being enforced at the moment are more about rescuing people who made bad deals than trying to restructure the societies and the economies of countries in the Far East . #% If this goes through , you will have got off pretty lightly and I hope you will give us assurances , firstly that you will properly justify this grade and position , and secondly , that we will be scrutinising every move you make when you put it in place , to make sure that it is done properly . #% Their use goes back over millennia . #% Mr President , first , we should all congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his work on these reports . #% Mr President , if the euro is as great a success as I hope and expect , it will play its part in revolutionising the European economy . #% By comparison , the risks posed by traditional herbal remedies are minimal . #% So I want to thank the Court particularly and look forward to further cooperation between the Court and the Committee on Budgetary Control in doing this interesting work . #% The decision by Edi Rama 's Socialist Party to boycott the parliament on the basis of alleged electoral fraud has compounded Albania 's instability . #% It led to a conflagration from which we are suffering still and to evils which we still do not comprehend . #% I offer Professor Diamandouros all my congratulations . #% Mr President , I thank the President-in-Office for that welcome statement of the new priority , which I am sure will resonate around the Community and be very much welcomed by a lot of people . #% Europol 's anti-terrorist unit needs beefing up , but we do not need a European public prosecutor , and the UK is wise to stay out of Schengen and control its own borders . #% What we must do is tell the peoples of Europe the truth about our ambitions and give them free and fair referendums , otherwise we are heading for disaster . #% It might be helpful for colleagues if in advance of that debate , in which there will be a great deal of interest , Parliament 's services would consider reprinting copies of the joint address to this House by the Speaker of the Knesset and the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council . #% We have been following the development of this very closely . #% Mr Swoboda has already mentioned certain countries which he feels should participate in the conference . #% I congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt , who has achieved so much over this long process . #% This went through committee without opposition and I am surprised and a little disappointed that some colleagues today should be upset about this amendment . #% At the end of the document there is also reference to direct or indirect funding of the European Union , so that we can once again operate with the European Union ' s own resources . #% In the meantime research on those substances has been going on with the support of several Commission services . #% In welcoming this scheme , I hope that when it is reviewed in 2003 , if any of the problems I have mentioned have arisen , these can be addressed . #% I welcome the emphasis in this report on small businesses . #% Whether it is Mr Blair or not , the fact is he will not be democratically elected ; you yourself have not been democratically elected ; in fact , does n't this rather sum up the whole EU ? #% For that reason I am particularly concerned about the potential effects of Amendments Nos 3 and 4 and their impact upon tyre safety , especially for vehicles such as buses and trucks . #% Because of our desire to see more jobs not less , UK Conservatives have voted against this resolution . #% My last point relates to textiles again . #% It has produced a single market on paper , but not yet a single market in reality . #% In closing I would say that it is a great pleasure to be here as the other half of `` les deux gilles ciel et espace '' club , with my colleague , Mr Savary . #% Until Member States understand and react to strategic transport needs as covered by the TENs programme and make the necessary financial commitment , we shall find ourselves in a constant round of review and argument as to the financial requirements in this regard . #% While in Palestine , and in a purely private capacity , I had a meeting with representatives of Hamas on the West Bank , on the basis that they had fought the municipal elections in Palestine . #% There were times at the beginning when we were not sure that would happen , and I hope that , having gone through this experience , our government will now become a big fan of the solidarity fund in Council and will persuade other Member States accordingly . #% We all need to recognise that SMEs are the biggest employers overall , that SMEs are the biggest engine of growth for the European economies . #% Clearly , with hindsight , mistakes have been made in underestimating the scale of resistance , but withdrawing all the coalition troops would only worsen matters . #% I would also like to record our support for Mrs Grossetête 's report and to emphasise that in our view it is of supreme importance that EU law is implemented consistently , properly and in a timely manner . #% It has been pointed out that the average jogger exceeds the limit by a factor of 7 or 8 , while even walking down a road could break the rules . #% You were appointed through a process of rather squalid intergovernmental bargaining , which was not very impressive . #% Over the years the United Kingdom has developed a highly effective military capability and yet the United Kingdom armed forces are now desperately overstretched and most Member States of the European Union spend a smaller proportion of their GDP on defence than the United Kingdom . #% What will you do if the smaller countries say that , as you have failed to change the gender of these big boys , why should we carry out the sex-change operation ? #% This proposal on road transport thus seeks to close one of the last remaining gaps , but even so it will not cover all drivers . #% Even Mr Berend says that it is incomprehensible that the Commission can make an arbitrary political assessment , thus calling into question the credentials of the institution that has produced this proposal . #% Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments , or in German state governments , or even the British government ' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today . #% Earlier this year Sir Nigel Sheinwald , the United Kingdom 's Permanent Representative to the EU , sent a strongly-worded letter to Mr Gemelli , Chairman of the Committee on Petitions , effectively seeking to block this Parliament 's right to get to the facts . #% It is because , Mrs Morgan , whilst I am totally committed to geographical balance , this would mean in Wales having one North Walian and one South Walian or I would generate even more dissatisfaction in the country I love most . #% The world 's fourth largest nation , Indonesia , still has to resolve its difficulties with Europe , including Portugal , over the question of East Timor . #% They want us to call chocolate as manufactured in seven Member States ersatz chocolate . #% Similar concerns arise in the context of the EU plans for European PNR and so-called ` positive profiling ' . #% This is a blatant attack from inside the wine-producing industry and should be forever rejected for future reports in this area . #% I am actually chairing another meeting in the furthest part of this vast building . #% The need for reform is as urgent as ever and I hope the Presidency will champion the kind of liberalising and reformist economic agenda that we have long urged . #% But two days after we left Mr Ruslan Sharipov was arrested . #% The difficulty is not in adopting this proposal but in implementing it . #% In particular , we have made almost no progress on avenues for legal immigration . #% Madam President , probably nowhere else in the world since 1965 has a greater proportion of the population been killed or suffered flagrant human rights violations at the hands of the authorities than in some of the territories under Indonesian rule . #% The rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture draw attention to the potential for research into new uses of timber . #% We must continue to ensure that the poorer regions that presently receive structural aid are not mistreated in the future and that Community initiatives , such INTERREG and URBAN , are retained . #% We are going to see them applied over a wider area , from Limerick -- which Mrs Doyle knows very well -- to new places such as Latvia , Nicosia and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , there is a certain inevitability about the debate today and the vote tomorrow ; after all , the European Union wants to become a global power , so the argument goes that the bigger it is , the better , and that there is a nice , cosy consensus here in the Chamber . #% In that situation , the governments that have agreed to this proposal have a responsibility to support financially this necessary work . #% As I said at the beginning , it is rare to have ministers here . #% I can understand why some colleagues would wish to extend the scope of this regulation into the field of tax , but this is not a Community competence and should not become one by the back door or indeed the front door . #% Does he share my considerable concern that Member States do not appear to be taking anything like seriously enough the fundamental principles that he has enunciated and would he give us some indication that he will give positive vent to them at the forthcoming meetings ? #% Mr President , I am pleased to support this report which raises serious and fundamental concerns about the multilateral agreement on investment and calls on the Member States responsible for its negotiation to respond . #% I am extremely grateful to my colleagues and coordinators of the other groups for the constructive negotiations which have been concluded by a firm intent to reform the electoral procedure of Parliament . #% 
Mr President , on behalf of Lord Inglewood I should like to say that he is extremely sorry not to be here , but he is unavoidably detained in the UK for family and business reasons . #% Mr President , I would like to inform the House , and for that matter the Commission , that the new Ambassador of the United States of America to the European Union , Mr Boyden Gray , is a lawyer with a special interest in public finance . #% Parliament 's assent to this agreement is already five months late , and the public simply would not appreciate a further refusal to make progress and to create a strict but fair regime for the Parliament as for the other bodies . #% Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Kyoto Protocol urges states to pursue reduction of greenhouse gases from this source through the International Civil Aviation Organization , but there are currently no plans for a global solution here . #% Mr President , the World Social Forum was originally initiated as a counterpoint to the World Economic Forum in Davos with the intention of trying to force social issues onto the globalisation agenda . #% It raises issues that need to be addressed and recommends courses of action that can ensure that the satellite system reaches Full Operational Capacity ( FOC ) as soon as possible , meaning a quicker return on the investment , and this report serves as the basis for the debate on how the Commission can best achieve this . #% The Government must also play its part and it is certainly not blameless in this . #% My party and group are committed to giving our full support , in particular to the British Government , its partners in the European Union and to our NATO allies . #% No , they must represent the views and experiences of disadvantaged people themselves . #% I do not believe we should extend the rights of some workers at the expense of others , nor should we vote for fewer consultation rights than we wish to see in the forthcoming Directive . #% When you talk of no revision for category 4 being necessary are you talking only about the year 2000 ? #% Thank you very much , Commissioner , on this auspicious evening for German -- or possibly Italian -- football . #% It also moves us forward in our commitment to improving access to bus and coach travel for those people with reduced mobility , and indeed disabled people , throughout the European Union . #% That is really at the heart of this question . #% I am afraid crises do not wait for the convenience of EU Foreign Ministers . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his response and I appreciate the difficulty he has in being more specific . #% That is politically essential for 20th century European capitalism , set in a social market economy . #% It is particularly disappointing that only five Member States have ratified Marpol Annex VI . #% The amendments concerning Articles 57 and 59 also pick up on the need to deal with potential problems before they affect individuals , and are indeed linked to previous European Parliament decisions . #% We call upon the Commission to implement full economic sanctions against Burma and to prohibit investment in Rangoon until human rights are properly respected . #% Rather than standing and attacking this House , they should take a step back , listen to what is being said in this debate and give their support to this House . #% There are many areas of work in which the shared values of both partners directly coincide . #% Even though this view , in many of our opinions , may also not be perfect in many ways , I congratulate him on his move forward . #% Let us get the whole matter done and dusted in double quick time ! #% Yet perfectly respectable osteopaths and chiropractors , for example , who are legally permitted to practise in some states , such as my own , face serious penalties in others - let alone receive any encouragement . #% Not just cost-impact assessments in terms of a global figure , but impact assessments as to the disadvantage of doing nothing set against the advantage of doing something . #% It is easy to forget how much nowadays we rely on microchips to run everything from dishwashers to dialysis machines . #% Madam President , I rise under Rule 126 ( 3 ) so that I might question whether a quorum exists for this vote . #% It does focus on important issues such as country of origin labelling , developing the organic market , where European products are the finest in the world , and exploiting the strengths of farming in Europe to give our farmers an advantage when taking their products to market - and this part is welcome . #% The honourable Member has made it clear that she , like many other Members , has criticisms of the Commission 's decision to cancel from next year the operating grants hitherto provided to networks and Info-Points . #% This makes it quite clear that certain aspects of this report fall outside the scope of the Community 's responsibilities referred to in Article 175 . #% I was pleased that the Commissioner put emphasis on the whole question of better regulation because we know that regulation bears much more on small businesses than on larger ones . #% We really need to make better use of all the intellectual capabilities that we have across the European Union by improving ways of working together , particularly by better focusing our efforts , by not duplicating that work , by bringing together the original thinkers that Mr MacCormick was talking about . #% We are proposing that the Union should itself sign up to the ECHR so that those rights inscribed in the existing Convention would form the solid core of the Charter . #% More importantly , it was ill-thought out and did not give even the proper legal basis for setting up such an important organization . #% That is my appeal to them . #% You tell us that you are trying to be open but that you have limited room for manoeuvre . #% We need more indicators . #% Mr President , the Socialist Group supports the Commission 's proposals which have been outlined today . #% To pick up on the issue of small - and medium-sized enterprises : yes , they are important , but only if - as Mr Schmidt said - they are of high quality . #% Whilst the report recognises that full employment can be achieved through further structural reforms of the labour market , it also calls for increased investment in training , especially for job seekers . #% What they did is they put in place a new treaty - it was called the Lisbon Treaty . #% I hope the Vice-President/High Representative will press him to set more of an example in opposing the alarming radicalisation of Pakistani society . #% Mr President , first of all , it is important that we all thank the rapporteur because of the enormous amount of work that he has undertaken in dealing with this extraordinarily technical and very complex directive . #% In terms of cultural richness and diversity , it is important both that we should have individual centres of cultural excellence and that we be bound as a European continent . #% The joint resolution recalls the Tampere Summit when Member State governments stated that the legal status of third-country nationals should be approximated to that of Member State nationals . #% We actually had the same objective . #% The WTO must explain to its citizens what it is doing or it will run the risk of undermining support for free trade . #% I say that because Member States must take decisions and they -- my own included -- must be pushed into taking those decisions . #% On a personal note , I feel that the Commission proposal does not represent a level playing field approach since , by extending the increase of a possible 20 % of project cost merely to certain modes , we are missing out on the chance for economic growth which is vital to the cohesion of an enlarged Union . #% I would urge the committee to do all it can to address the concerns of Mr and Mrs Radford , their neighbours and people who find themselves in similar situations in many parts of Europe . #% People will tolerate a lot from incompetent , corrupt governments , but push them too far and they will rebel . #% As President of the European Parliament 's All Party Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals , I naturally have a special interest in the Kreissl-Dörfler report . #% That was not the final solution , and we think that using CO2 , maybe a little bit later , would be a much more effective compromise . #% They obviously have every right to seek sanctuary , but we must also have legislation that does not tie individual nations ' hands regarding who is accepted and who gets asylum . #% I understand that they are relatively happy with the outcome of the amendments they tabled in this field . #% A bony Holstein steer would be in the same category as a champion Charolais but that prime animal 's twin sister would be in a different category solely because of its sex . #% A properly thought-through biofuels policy would mean European vehicles running on biofuels from certified sources only . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , Libya is a country where human rights are routinely abused and democracy is non-existent . #% The excellent Mr Pronk has kindly agreed to my suggestions in this regard . #% The proposal is for a single patent court , whose judiciary would be appointed by the same board as that which appoints judges to the present appeals court of the existing -- purely advisory -- European Patent Office . #% Some haulage companies are planning to shut down altogether due to EU over-regulation . #% They also object to mainland settlers being granted citizenship , as this would appear to reward the aggressor and violate the Geneva Conventions , which prohibit the settlement of outside populations by the occupying power . #% If the Commission sent the report to Parliament , it is our responsibility that it has not been circulated . #% The call is also for more help -- both available and affordable -- for diseases which affect the developed world , like diabetes , epilepsy , depression and schizophrenia . #% The amendments that Mrs Grossetête and I proposed and the committee supported bring this report back to where the Commission might prefer it to be . #% 
What about the other markets that we need to deal with here - the financial market , the internal market , the commodity markets ? #% I urge the Commission to resolve this legal base problem . #% The first is by ensuring that current legal provisions are complied with by all tenderers so as to avoid any unfair competition . #% Of course many of the refugees coming into Western Europe today are coming in a different way to that perceived 50 years ago at the time of the Geneva Convention . #% In this organization in Staffordshire we had over 200 members ranging from large companies such as Wedgwood and Steelite which are well-known - when you drink your coffee in this Parliament it is from crockery made in my constituency by Steelite - to micro companies . #% We are working on assumptions when we present this report from Mrs Haug . #% As the shadow rapporteur on the Visa Information System , that is also the approach I want to take . #% We think these amendments will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the Agency . #% I can not vote for this proposal tomorrow if the emasculation of Article 4 takes place . #% The Commission is one of the guardians of those Treaties and of those rights . #% Mr President , a few days ago , 19 Chinese people lost their lives in Morecambe Bay in the north-west of England . #% There are still Members here who would strip away the testing requirements almost completely : ` Trust us , they are chemical companies ' is their argument . #% Mr President , there is a very good Sunday newspaper in Britain called . #% That is not justice . #% It is very important that the European Union should provide aid . #% Financial services is Britain 's biggest and most successful industry . #% Only 9 of the first 61 country strategy papers had health as a focal area for cooperation . #% Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too . #% If there is to be any EU visit to Iraq it must include a visit to those families in Kuwait who are still waiting to know ten years later what happened to their loved ones . #% If we believe in partnership in development then we should respect their wishes . #% I would have hoped that Parliament might have seen fit to endorse these Commission proposals , but the rapporteur has gone off in the opposite direction . #% The Commission acknowledges , of course , that the decision provoked sharp reactions and protests from many national relay coordinators , several Member States , and several Members of this House . #% I say to the Commission , if you do not want that article to be amended further then you must take your responsibilities under the existing article more seriously . #% Madam President , this evening I have heard the words ` trafficking ' , ` slavery ' , ` violence ' , ` abuse ' , ` organised crime ' , ` paedophilia ' , ` rape ' - all of them scourges of modern society , as we all agree . #% This is not a happy business , for I fear that we may have betrayed not only the European institutions but also the new Member States and , worst of all , our fellow citizens of Europe . #% The issue of using the IMEI numbers is clearly a first step , in that bulk transactions of mobile phones should only be authorised if the IMEI numbers are checked to make sure those phones have not already been subject to a previous fraudulent transaction . #% It is wrong and we should say so . #% The scope of this work can not be underestimated : its importance ranks in the very highest policy that the EU should now be developing . #% In a European Union with a common market and the freedom of movement of workers , this makes absolutely no sense . #% You did not say whether the constituent was finally reimbursed but you are making the point that we want to see a better system put into place , and I take note of what you say . #% Mr President , I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur , who has worked very hard on this and produced an excellent report which has my firm support . #% They are extremely confused and the EU 's proceedings are misunderstood , as you know , Commissioner . #% This report seeks to ensure a high level of consumer protection and to ensure a fair and transparent gaming environment in cyberspace . #% However , we are firmly against any unilateral nuclear disarmament that would expose our nation and its people to risk and leave our strategic defence entirely in the hands of others . #% Conditionality will mean no protection now . #% Do we have a comprehensive plan to cover the next volcanic eruption ? #% We should use this proposal to introduce greater legal certainty . #% So put that one in your pipe and smoke it ! #% The policy planning and early warning unit allows us at long last to analyse what we mean by a common foreign and security policy . #% People trafficking , or slavery as we used to call it , stamped out by the British Empire with the force of the Royal Navy behind it , is now a sad fact of life under the new Brussels Empire . #% Good luck , Sir ! #% When we remind them that the European Court of Auditors has , for the tenth year running , refused to sign the books because billions of pounds have gone missing , they might well put two and two together as regards what has happened to our 75 billion . #% However , what we are absolutely clear about is that there is a right under the Directive for medical monitoring of the survivors , proper surveillance and intervention measures - not merely statistical exercises as have been conducted to date , but proper clinical , medical monitoring that would benefit not only those survivors but also the health and safety of all Europe 's citizens in the event of such future incidents . #% This is the ninth rate cut this year . #% There is a huge body of independent evidence that has proven that the introduction of improved training , safer working practices and the use of medical devices incorporating safety-engineered protection mechanisms will prevent the majority of needle-stick injuries . #% - Mr President , you realise this is the second month running you have done this to me - cut me off as my question was coming up . #% If we become uncompetitive through tax or regulation , people simply move - and they can do so in the space of 24 hours . #% On the hearings , I agree with Mr Corbett that it has been a good start , but there are several things that need to be improved when the issue comes up again in 2004 , for example , the possibility of our voting on individual Commissioners after a committee or at least an indicative vote to see whether the committee was really in favour or not . #% The original text was , quite rightly , heavily opposed and indeed heavily amended . #% However , unless we have focus in the programme , unless we can show that the EU is adding value and not just making a series of declarations at summits or conferences , it will be very difficult to convince the Council and the public of the need for an increased budget . #% The result has undermined both the country-of-origin principle and the principle of the single passport , because operators still face multiple , overlapping and sometimes conflicting sets of rules when they trade across the European Union - just the problem which the ISD was supposed to tackle . #% That argument might fall away when every currency is called the euro , and no longer the franc , pound , peseta or lira . #% But this is ultimately the responsibility of Member States . #% The US does engage in spying but , if Roxana Saberi was a spy , the Iranian authorities by their actions did nothing to convince anyone of that case . #% We must be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime . #% I believe that it is important that we voice all these concerns and urge the Commission to remain firm in the principles and policies of this place . #% This is something perhaps which should be added to the list of child abuse which we as a Community ought to be looking into very carefully . #% After all , we in Parliament thought of the date of 2004 in the beginning , and the same date is appropriate for Bulgaria . #% We trust that work will progress as speedily as possible so that the full revised proposal may come into force within the next two years . #% I do not need to detain the House with a lot of the technical details relating to those texts . #% We expect the Commission to take on board our concerns in its review of feed legislation programmed for next year . #% However , the decision to make the Euratom loan available to complete those reactors marks a very important step towards improving EU/Ukraine relations because the loan agreement marks the willingness of Ukraine to operate its nuclear plant to safety standards equivalent to those in the European Union . #% Mr President , I said earlier that this was largely a tidying-up exercise , but drew attention to the fact that Rule 180 ( 8 ) would now apply to all Rules of Procedure . #% Mr President , this is a debate about plant research and plant protection from research . #% Could the Presidency at least give us those answers in writing , please ? #% The final outcome may be the same ; then again it could be different in certain areas , such as category 1 ( b ) , where in committee we voted for a figure above the EUR 83 million margin for the less favoured areas . #% 
Those of you who have examined the lists will have seen that they are interchangeable . #% I would ask you , Mr President , to express regret that the Council made a statement very early this morning , which was extremely weak . #% Well , I must say that is the first time I have ever received such applause and I am tempted , Mr Verhofstadt , to sit down but , if I may , sadly , the story continues . #% Turkey , as we appreciate , suffers from an extremely vulnerable border and it is a particular problem for it to establish the requisite stability and peaceful circumstances that its integration to Europe properly requires . #% We know that in many places witnesses have failed to come forward for one of two reasons : a misplaced sense of loyalty or fear of consequences . #% It is important we deal with those issues now , as part of our overall strategy to open up the internal market for services . #% The scaling-up of trade facilitation , technical assistance and support to help ACP producers meet EU standards must be sufficiently extensive to offset losses from tariff revenues and help ACP countries take advantage of market access . #% The vote on changing the calendar to allow two of these Strasbourg sessions to take place within the same week reflects our desire as MEPs to cut costs and CO2 emissions . #% Realistically , it is now left with the Council : almost three years have passed since the resignation of the Commission , and we still have not seen the reform that everyone is looking for . #% But perhaps I should not be surprised because it seems to me that in the European Union one is drowned in paper to the level where the European Parliament - and , I am sure , the Council of Ministers - can not actually read what they are being asked to approve . #% Rather than further encumbering the European political process , this report recognises that it is for the European Parliament in its sphere , and national parliaments in theirs , in accordance with their own national traditions , to scrutinise their own governments ' conduct of European business and activities in the Council of Ministers . #% Would he agree that if the European Union is to connect better with its citizens , then the public sources of information need to reflect the principles of openness and transparency ? #% We therefore fully endorse the Commission 's thorough approach to preparing candidates for membership and its willingness to learn the lessons of previous enlargements , in particular , the most recent ones to Bulgaria and Romania , where there were outstanding problems in the areas of organised crime and corruption . #% The World Bank and the World Trade Organization predict that as a result of the abolition of all quotas China 's share of world trade in textiles and clothing will rise from 17 % in 2003 to over 50 % by 2010 . #% Mr President , culture is certainly not a high priority for Parliament or the Commission . #% There was also agreement in committee that in this evolving area we remain deeply concerned as to the impact of legislation on Europe ' s e-business . #% We therefore look forward to full democracy in Hong Kong as soon as possible . #% We must do everything we can . #% Madam President , on principle , on these matters it is very unwise to accept oral amendments however worthy they may sound . #% Mr President , since Thursday , 7 January , between 100 and 150 people have been killed in a series of brutal massacres carried out primarily by the AUC paramilitaries . #% Can we have the assurance that will happen ? #% The ALDE Group will also be supporting those amendments from the PPE-DE Group which offer improved wording and avoid overly restrictive definitions of , for instance , decent working benchmarks . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President of the Commission for delivering the Commission 's programme very much in a political context . #% Did we get that ? #% We will sometimes need education or legislation on smoking , drugs , alcohol , salt , saturated and trans fats , lack of exercise , as well as things like stress management and all the causes of hypertension . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by explaining to the House that in his opening remarks my fellow countryman , Mr Nattrass , was confusing the application of the Working Time Directive to the transport industry with this directive . #% That is rather inadequate . #% That means that we need to confront the reality that the neo-liberal economic policies of the European Union are currently part of the problem , not the solution . #% We must stop playing games with each other . #% The primary purpose of education is not to prepare people for the job market but to prepare them for a life which is fulfilling in every way . #% Mr President , in my first speech in this Chamber , I had hoped to speak about linking the banks of lifts electronically to make them more efficient , about ventilation in the bathrooms , about the air conditioning and about the dog-sick carpets in the bar areas . #% Since being appointed rapporteur I have come to know Madam X and she has told me her story . #% I hope he will keep to that and still reconsider biofuels on set-aside . #% I also welcome the reinvigoration of the Lisbon Agenda , without which our continent will lose out to the emerging markets of the East and the proposed free-trade areas of the Americas . #% The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking . #% There is nothing to stop manufacturers from selling new barometers without any mercury , along with a set of instructions on how consumers can fill them themselves . #% In most cases , and even under the original proposal to end subsidies , the Commission still offered to provide technical assistance in 2004 for those relays that wanted to avail themselves of it . #% The Socialist Group supports an industrial policy . #% My group believes we need an asylum agency to organise expert teams to help countries under stress assess claims . #% We were made welcome and we saw some improvements in human rights and a willingness to open doors . #% I also believe that exaggerated accusations of failure will not help to create the right incentives for policy makers to take risks and take action . #% If only the EU sought reform in the WTO with the same vigour it has won the USD 4 billion trade sanctions against the United States in relation to our steel exports , perhaps the poorest countries would start to believe us when we say we want a development round . #% For the majority of my Group , this means that we need to think in terms of consolidation over the coming period , rather than enlargement . #% We have no problem with the German Government if it goes down these roads , or indeed down the Scandinavian nationwide road . #% For companies within EU countries , there would be gains if we could tackle barriers to public procurement , to the medical devices market - where there is insufficient recognition of international standards , to services - including financial services and postal services , and access for SMEs . #% Indeed , many Members present here today will be in Palestine next week . #% Should we approve this legislation tomorrow it would mean the beginning of the end of the present informal ` moratorium ' on GMO commercial approvals . #% Mr Sacconi and Mrs Ek have negotiated compromises that will meet the genuine concerns of industry while still setting high standards of environmental protection . #% It is quite wrong that Parliament can not vote on individual Commissioners but must vote on the College as a whole . #% If people are to have secure access to water , we can not pressure them into privatising their water supplies under the GATS agreement . #% It is ambitious . #% This is a health and safety at work issue . #% As the front cover of The Economist said this week : Europe is not working ! #% I quote : ` It is to be recalled that ( ... ) the programme MEDIA has now clearer references to the importance of European cinema for intercultural dialogue ' . #% It is also a country with which the West has had troubled relations over a number of years . #% It is important that we achieve a balance between enabling the Baltic states applying to join the European Union to modernize their fleets - in the case of Latvia , as has been said , boats are on average 20 years old - and the need to maintain overall fish stocks and not increase overall fishing capacity . #% Madam President , a few minutes ago you reported that there were corrections to all languages . #% There will be a new type of personal data that is being used in a benign way to monitor the operation of our car and the security systems in our house , but if somebody could accumulate and collect that data it would be a far from benign use of it . #% It seems a self-evident truth that unless the bodies are independent - and , if I could echo Mr Herman 's point , it is actually easier to find examples of lack of independence than independence , let us be blunt about it - and unless they have the resources to do the task that the Commission rightly lays upon them , then we are setting up legislation which is almost bound not to work . #% As regards the negative statements on Turkey , I am afraid that , sadly , we have seen racism and xenophobia rear their ugly heads . #% It is a budget , as Commissioner Liikanen said , of prudence : we use the terms ' a citizens ' budget ' and ' a taxpayers ' budget ' in the same sentence and I think that is what we are trying to achieve with these guidelines . #% But because the changes Parliament wants to make to this directive are so fundamental , we would like to send it back to the Commission to allow them to rewrite it to take into account the marketing ban and take a more realistic view of the alternative testing methods that may be available , not using animals . #% Even if tomorrow this House kicks it out , what we will get is a new set of political appointees , and it will still continue to look like a rest home for failed domestic politicians . #% Could you explain why that decision was taken . #% In our discussions about the details , we must not lose sight of that fact . #% I would be grateful if that could be put right . #% 
Regarding the recent agreement made over the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad , I want to stress that Lithuanian sovereignty must be respected and Schengen membership not compromised . #% We insisted from the beginning that we should pick up on the Commission , Council and Parliament declaration of December 2000 , specifically looking to reduce outstanding commitments to a normal level by December 2003 . #% I therefore hope that Amendment No 42 will be carried tomorrow . #% The EU is committed to countering pollution in the Baltic Sea and ensuring the safety of nuclear plants and installations . #% Unless we have an ethical element in farming it is unlikely that we will have commendation in the future for measures that we might take the next time this happens . #% I speak as someone passionately concerned for the third world and emotionally affected by some of the attacks there have been on those of us who happen to make chocolate in a different way and have done so throughout my lifetime . #% Perhaps Ceausescu 's bitter legacy , however , was responsible for the fact that the political will for change was slower to emerge in Romania than in some other former Soviet Union candidate countries . #% Ninety-one percent were over the moon with what had happened to them on the course . #% Until now , farmers would have lost the right to vaccinate their animals if the UK was declared entirely free from bluetongue . #% I think this is a very important benefit . #% Regrettably , the threat of terrorism remains all too real in much of the region . #% My own particular concern is with the impact of justice and security policies on urban areas . #% The industry was never formally consulted . #% I described the country as the ` Cuba of Europe ' . #% We have to have funding for major research into the status of disabled people . #% We are giving real help to ships in distress to ensure that they are properly handled in emergency situations , closing a loophole in the safety chain . #% We have not achieved all we want . #% China is a vast country with a trained and productive workforce , but it is not a democracy and remains essentially an authoritarian , one-party , Communist State -- although Marxism plays little part in its political or economic thinking at present . #% The draft financial package proposed by the Commission on 10 February -- some EUR 4.2 billion over three years -- provides an excellent basis for the final phase of negotiations . #% Secondly , how does the Commission intend to ensure that countries without production capacity or insufficient production capacity can make full use of the compulsory licensing provisions ? #% We have been very niggardly in relation to the free movement of labour . #% It had fallen partly because we had refused to talk to the elected representatives . #% It will bring home the truth to the British people that it is not the elected representatives that matter in this European Union , it is people that give away national democracy in favour of the European Union that win the top jobs . #% Moreover , in most EU Member States , the level of official development assistance remains far below the UN target and , contrary to the Gothenburg declaration , the Council is proposing for its 2002 budget a further 3.2 % cut in commitments on foreign aid compared to last year ' s budget . #% Liberal democracy has triumphed . #% We also consider that there are many respects in which the report introduces major improvements to the original proposal , and we congratulate Mrs Fraga accordingly . #% This change to the Rules of Procedure will enable us to get rid of this sort of nonsense , and where we do not have a very good reason for having a special report on a report , or a special debate on a report , we will no longer need to do so . #% Mr President , this report appears to be quite technical but , in essence , it can be summed up in three words : safety , safety and safety . #% . -- Mr President , that is acceptable . #% The Commission proposal was a good one but perhaps could be improved . #% It has partly been successful because it has been able to include things which the Commission and the Council were not originally willing to consider . #% This seems to me to mark a turning point in how this Parliament debates these matters , because it sets out here a coherent , ethical framework by which we should all subsequently be judged . #% As a firm supporter I only wish my own country England was on the verge of joining . #% I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions . #% Then this morning , in the debate on statistics , Commissioner Rehn said yesterday 's downgrade by Moody 's was not ` conveniently timed ' and that that would influence Commission thinking on credit rating agency regulation . #% In a national government , if a minister is guilty of serious misconduct or mismanagement but refuses to resign , then the leader of the government concerned can dismiss him or her . #% I hope that the Council will agree to such a revaluation . #% It is one which most commentators and all but one European country , Germany - a country which I normally hold in esteem but which welched on a unanimously agreed position of the Council - support . #% This proposed gas regulation deals with similar issues to the electricity regulation agreed by the Council and Parliament last year . #% Fortunately we tend not to suffer from the allegations of fraud and mismanagement that one sees elsewhere but we do have a problem about the very worthy organisations that want support from Parliament actually receiving the money . #% Too many workers within the European Union continue to be at risk of hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work . #% The Eurostat affair and the issues concerning whistleblowers and the position of OLAF show that the Commission is slow to tackle things . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , taxation as a concept has not really changed very much in the last 3 000 years , has it ? #% As mentioned in Mr Rehn 's statement this afternoon , we must encourage the Commission to look at the competitive conditions . #% Something that has been developed for a sophisticated technology-based organisation is not appropriate for Joe 's Cafe in Lewisham High Street or Jean Dupont 's bistro in the rue de la Révolution in Marseilles . #% Your officials are calling for a revision of indexation clauses and pay deals , the promotion of flexible work , a review of unemployment benefits and a reduction of over-protection of workers . #% They could , of course , declare it still to be open and ask for a further hearing with one or another designate Commissioner . #% In the meantime , I agree with him . #% Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax , but I can not understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue . #% We all know that a disgraceful amount of fish is discarded in the European Union every year . #% It is important that we are having our debate today in the context of the future of the automotive industry because the issues surrounding the decision that Ford was forced to make at Genk go to the heart of our thinking on how we need to secure a long-term sustainable future for automotive manufacture in Europe , the technology and the jobs that go with it , and I and many colleagues here have a huge interest in that . #% Can the Commission provide more funds to combat illegal immigration and border flows through these countries , irrespective of our disapproval of their governments in office at the moment ? #% Mr President , I rather suspect that voters outside this House would have some difficulty understanding what is going on here this afternoon and indeed some of us may . #% If we think , as we do , that women 's human rights in Afghanistan are grossly denied , we must take account of that in deciding asylum claims . #% There was a lot of rhetoric about human rights , just as there is now , but a huge gap between rhetoric and reality . #% Mr President , on behalf of the PPE Group , I wish to propose that the Miranda report be referred back to committee . #% However , there are areas of the report that I would disagree with . #% I was privileged to be an immigration minister in the last government . #% I would like to see November become the permanent changeover date . #% At the moment these women -- and we are mainly talking of women and girls -- have no guaranteed protection . #% We actually suggested that the budgetary authority should have a value for money exercise looking at every European Union institution . #% This feeling of suspicion is something which also feeds radicalisation and fundamentalism , which can be based on race as well as religion . #% We strongly reject the questions about the legality of the culls because the courts in the United Kingdom upheld their legality . #% I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets for their support and input into this procedure , but above all I should like to thank the Committee on Budgets staff who have enabled all of this to be put together . #% Peace , however , is only possible on the basis of accepting the right of the peoples of Sudan to democracy and democratic self determination . #% However , I do think that science offers some solutions . #% 
Through a process of dialogue between our respective offices , paragraph 49 is now an adequate recognition of the position . #% Of course , the US continues to out-perform Europe and the competitive challenges from Asia , particularly China and India , are increasing with no apparent urgent response from national capitals in the EU . #% I urge the Commission and the Council to make the link between poverty eradication and basic education . #% As a corollary , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations . #% The whole process of framing legislation would be empowered , both in the House of Commons and for the British people , if UK ministers went before the House of Commons and were asked which way they were going to vote in the Council of Ministers and then did so in a totally transparent and open fashion . #% I hope that on examination it will be understood that I say this in a mood of explanation and transparency , not apology or evasiveness , and it is necessary simply because of the material we are dealing with . #% The question of definitions is , of course , going to be difficult and we have to work on that . #% I urge you to look at the deadline for amendments so that the proper full group meeting that is normally only held on a Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning can take place and so that the Members of this House have some say in how and where they meet . #% As Mr Catania says , protection in human rights concerns must be integrated into border management , particularly in the mandate of Frontex . #% Madam President , being consistent and on the same matter I wish to point out that the British Government is absolutely even-handed in its arrest policy . #% We need to be sure that we are pressing the need for workers ' rights -- on low wages , on long hours and on the lack of secure contracts . #% The national veto should remain in those areas . #% Mr President , may I strike what may be a mitigating note in this debate , certainly not to condone in any way the actions of the dictatorial President in Belarus . #% It goes on to say , `` Adopting OECD standards on reporting should be feasible by 2001 . '' #% September 11 should have taught us that we must apply the same principles to our friends , as to our enemies . #% However , if the Commission can propose a modification or a derogation that allows the continuation of the rather good B&Q labelling scheme in Britain , I would welcome some proposals along those lines . #% There is a likelihood of a summit between Mr Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy . #% Secondly , will Commissioner Diamantopoulou repeat her assurance , made to Parliament on 30 May , that if business fails to make progress on annual social and environmental reporting within the two years , the Commission will consider making such reporting mandatory ? #% Madam President , the complete , total and disgraceful failure of the common fisheries policy and the consequent collapse of fish stocks means that the EU must now cast its net wider and wider to satisfy voracious Spanish demands . #% The reason for this is that there were not sufficient good projects ; in fact some calls had no response at all . #% Can the Council Presidency please tell me whether this is a case of incompetence , or is there a secret agenda to introduce a kerosene tax ? #% I would just like to pay my tribute to this very great , French , single-handed yachtsman , and I crave your indulgence , Mr President , for so doing . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if he is aware that many Members of this House do not share the view that an extension of duty-free is a good idea ? #% This will be part of the new reform procedures that have to go out there and have to work for the sake of delivering and eventually completing the internal market . #% Of course wages can not be equal . #% What will the Council do to ensure that all 15 European Union countries will sign up to a global ban in Ottawa , and what will it do to promote the idea not only in Europe but throughout the rest of the world ? #% In the long run that will be the most significant thing . #% I pay tribute to our rapporteur Dagmar Roth-Berendt , and I thank our chief lobbyists Marlou Heinen of the RSPCA , Emily McIvor of BUAV , and Charles Laroche of Unilever who presented the acceptable face of an industry many have grown to mistrust . #% For all these reasons Conservatives abstained on this report . #% I have one comment for the Commissioner , on which I will ask for his advice and particularly his nod of approval in a moment . #% On sulphur emissions , it is appropriate to mention the Commission 's proposal on the revision of Directive 99/32/EC relating to the sulphur content of marine fuels . #% Now the Greens are talented politicians - and I say this in admiration . #% Hopefully this will now do that . #% The old process that we are talking about is one of compromise , as President Santer said . #% Israel 's agreement today to end the track-and-kill operations of senior political figures from Islamist groups is to be welcomed . #% We must also note that paragraph 15 states that all luggage must be screened and security tightened . #% This is an important issue , which is affecting more and more people . #% That report is available to colleagues . #% Hailed as an environmental project , it has done near irreparable damage to fish stocks . #% As he says , the protests continue and Prince Ranariddh said only yesterday that he feared the whole thing could shortly spin out of control . #% For example , in the UK we have seen a recent case of somebody actually ending up with a prison sentence on a charge of trafficking for domestic servitude . #% However , I am concerned about expenditure in a number of areas that do not reflect value for money or have negative consequences for EU citizens and people in developing countries . #% In connection with graduation , it is important to extend the scheme to new products . #% The future of Europe depends on high tech , high skill , high value-added jobs . #% The various stages in the completion of the single market were a good example of that . #% The result of this is that once their children reach school age , they have to go to other parts of Cyprus to attend schools . #% Tunisia has not yet , however , signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . #% We also believe there is a danger that the International Criminal Court will be used to make political mischief by parties hostile to our American allies . #% We did not achieve this , but we achieved a great deal more . #% We point out that fine words about free movement can never be fully realised until difficult issues for Member States , including the protection for social security benefits for disabled workers crossing our borders , can be tackled . #% Over the coming year , I hope the Council will establish an ever closer working relationship with the Parliament as the CSFP continues to evolve . #% I shall raise this matter in writing , but I just wanted to put it on record . #% Equally , we are not supporting the amendments which seek to delete mention of factors of economic and monetary policy , which we believe have a significant impact on social circumstances . #% In many parts of the world , share farming is a common practice . #% We are , however , at a crucial stage in preparations for accession and the importance of opening doors for candidate countries to participate in the Community programmes , as well as encouraging them to adopt Community regulations , is paramount . #% Firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur for all her hard work on this issue . #% We should take careful note of that . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on the work that she has done . #% We agree that the delayed agreement of the programmes in the first period - 12 % of the money being carried over - causes unacceptable damage in the regions and localities which wait too long and then are forced to spend too quickly . #% Mr President , there was to have been a debate on the question of football violence . #% Your fanaticism is out in the open . #% Bolivar State in Venezuela has already been the scene of new concessions for timber extraction and has suffered the impact of uncontrolled alluvial gold-mining . #% There is now a widespread early retirement culture within the Union . #% In recognising the prompt action of the UK on 20 and 21 February , could you confirm that the UK has in fact now asked to draw down the remaining tranche of agrimonetary compensation , as the British Minister announced last night . #% Like Mr Ettl , I will address the two simultaneously as they raise similar issues . #% I do not believe that we will achieve that simply by adopting these reports tomorrow but we will have gone a long way to securing our goal to protect lives at sea and to protect the marine environment . #% 
This is a direct result of lobbying by right-wing elements in the Church of England hostile to homosexuals . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , summers are hotter and storms are more severe . #% This will ensure that other species are protected . #% I conclude by saying that this is a key moment in this budgetary process . #% This has been a significant success for Parliament and also for both the Commission and the Member States in Council . #% Therefore , we should be looking to encourage progress and reform . #% It would get rid of the problems of Commissioners without portfolios for a lengthily period and it would make sense in its own right to have the elections early in May , which is a good idea on its own merits . #% Clearing the path of regulatory barriers means introducing new directives . #% deputising for the author . - I wish to thank the President-in-Office for that comprehensive answer , and would simply ask what plans there are to ensure the synergy between the two different years - 2007 and 2008 - so that a holistic approach is adopted and that they benefit one another and interact , rather than being organised totally separately . #% Mr President , in welcoming the Commissioner 's commitment to working with the UN agencies , can I ask him if he agrees with Kofi Annan that there can be no economic health without physical and mental health , and will he work with the agencies , particularly WHO and UNICEF , to achieve that . #% Some 20 years ago Mrs Thatcher went to Fontainebleau and said : ' I want our money back ' -- and she got some of it . #% I would draw Members ' attention to Amendment No 129 by Mrs Berger . #% I hope that the Danish Government will use the provisions in this instance . #% I believe that only the Central Bank , for instance , should pronounce when necessary on foreign exchange target zones for the euro , to avoid conflicting messages being given to the financial markets . #% It is a testament to the tough and stringent controls in place in my own country that this particular breach was picked up so quickly and effectively . #% My vote in favour of this report reflects the importance of enabling SMEs to function in a manner not over-complicated by regulations , but one which encourages efficiency , flexibility and investment . #% These measures , together with the emphasis on constraints on fishing effort being proportionate between the Member States and on improved satellite monitoring , are essential if our beleaguered fishing communities are to engage with the regulation in any positive way . #% If health messages are to work and society is to be protected we must replace prohibition with government regulation . #% The EU , a body of 25 states , will soon have a population of 455 million and be the biggest economic zone in the world , even bigger than the United States of America . #% Furthermore , in the past , the UN was powerless to stop the brutal invasions of Hungary , Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan as a result of the Soviet veto . #% I urge the Commission to do that . #% There are a number of internal conflict situations that are causing considerable concern and I think that we in this Parliament should be adding our support to the President and to the authorities in Azerbaijan . #% That is the reality of industrial life . #% He confirmed that he has now received key support from the opposition United Front/Northern Alliance forces and will facilitate an internal settlement appropriate to his country . #% We consider it to be a thorough and wide-ranging piece of work that highlights many positive points about the state of human rights within the European Union , even if many parts of it make extremely uncomfortable reading . #% It is very clear to us that the public want to be involved , they want to be informed and they want information in good time about particular proposals . #% The Sudanese government has an appalling record of ruthless repression in north and south alike , apart from its military operations : imprisonment , torture , execution and the use of terrorism against its own and neighbouring peoples . #% Sweden has solved such swindles on small businesses by legislating a statutory right to interest . #% I ask you to undertake an immediate investigation . #% It is a welcome feature of many of the projects which are funded by this budget line that they are funded additionally in many cases or complemented by voluntary work and voluntary contributions made to the NGOs by many of their supporters . #% author . - Mr President , in short , I am disappointed with the Commission 's response to our oral question . #% Visit the country but do not ever step off the tarmac . #% Furthermore , medium - and long-term development aid must not be allowed to be cut back , particularly for social needs . #% Increasingly , we have funded military action as tension and conflict get out of control . #% But how can we compromise , how can we find a way out between two radically different solutions ? #% The special trade allowances which we give , as wealthy countries , to poorer countries as a ladder out of poverty are now being challenged by those who prescribe blanket liberalization as the only option . #% First , recycling targets must be realistic and achievable and practical for both retailers and the public , which is why I did not support some amendments tabled by the rapporteur and others . #% It seems to us that the list is getting larger and that the burden of proof must remain with those , be they in Member States , in the Commission or in the Scientific Committees , who want us to adapt these things . #% I am sure tomorrow when it comes to the vote we can as a Parliament give with one voice a clear commitment to the future of Europe 's maritime sector . #% My own region , Essex , in the east of England , has 18 urban wards in the 25 % most deprived in the UK . #% I hope we can take lessons from what we do tomorrow when we deal with further legislation next month . #% In the opinion for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , we highlighted the fact that this is an exercise in better law-making . #% At last airlines will be forced to provide passengers with the food and refreshments they deserve , with the dignity and respect they deserve . #% The EU should recognise this and return this responsibility to national governments . #% Then secondly at European level : we must make this a European debate , not just another quick IGC behind closed doors , but a public debate . #% A lot of this debate sounds to me at times rather like gender discrimination : people claim it does not exist because they have never experienced it . #% What actually matters is a light touch on the e-commerce directive , a light touch on telecommunications . #% I think this is an unnecessary measure . #% This concept I wholeheartedly reject . #% My main question , to which I would like a reply , Mr President of the Commission , concerns the internal documents relating to Eurostat . #% Mr President , I would like to draw attention to the astounding failure of the British Government - a Labour Government , although I can not describe it as socialist - to respect EU anti-discrimination law . #% Madam President , I wish to thank my own group for allowing this resolution to come this far . #% This was one step forward , but an important one . #% I should like clarification from you , Commissioner . #% This clearly gives licence to interfere in matters of national sovereignty and national autonomy . #% In neither case would disciplinary action result from making such reports . #% This is a process in which the whole of Europe is engaged with the whole of the Mediterranean . #% Indeed , there was another incident in London last night , and I offer our condolences to the latest victim of terrorism in Spain . #% We should , of course , endeavour to use trade agreements to spread core labour values and to carry out the delicate task of improving conditions for workers in developing countries who often see such moves as hidden protectionism . #% These measures will fortunately be implemented very soon . #% If this directive is implemented as the Council wishes , those businesses would almost certainly be forced to close , thus eliminating places where consumers can take their existing instruments for repair and for maintenance . #% I have taken it up with the services and they said that the mistake could be rectified at plenary . #% We ignore Israeli racism and stand by with scarcely a word of protest as Israel imposes collective punishment on the people of Gaza . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Madam President , this proposal has been highly controversial and it is extremely complex . #% In many of the poorest countries , entrepreneurs tell me that they are desperate to tackle poverty . #% The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that European labour markets should be open , like the UK 's , and should not fear tides of immigration . #% 
I know the Commission has difficulty with that . #% Mr President , September 11 , the attacks on the twin towers in New York , opened up a new chapter in the concept of war -- namely , an asymmetric , large-scale attack by a well-organised and well-resourced , fanatic , international , Islamist grouping affiliated to al-Qa ` ida , with no respect for the traditional rules and conduct of war as we know them and very difficult to formally classify under the Third and Fourth Geneva Protocols of 1949 . #% It is obviously irrelevant to China that time and time again , the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's spiritual leader , has stressed that he seeks maximum autonomy for Tibet , not independence . #% We need a general framework on information and consultation and we also need a review of the law on transfers , mergers and take-overs - not involved here but in the banking and insurance sector for example . #% Mr President , just for the record : it is my understanding that , after a careful process of negotiation between the PSE and the PPE , the PPE will be withdrawing their resolution . #% We need to tackle the demand side of the equation by putting real effort into implementing energy efficiency measures and by developing indigenous sources of energy , particularly renewables . #% Do not tell me that the US is a competitive economy : in terms of reinsurance , it is not . #% I particularly welcome his proposal to keep increases within the rate of inflation . #% Madam President , we must tackle the root causes of maladministration and fraud . #% The EU will not listen to the people it is meant to represent . #% It is essential that you consider this particular element . #% Therefore the information is not effective and , as the Commissioner implied , there should be an agreement between Member States to try to remove this artificial barrier to free movement . #% I have to say at the outset that I am extremely encouraged by the fact that the Commission has worked out such a very clear strategy for dealing with these very critical weeks before the election takes place . #% There is a temptation , I am sure , for concealment to happen elsewhere in the world also . #% I wonder if you are able to confirm , or your services are able to confirm , that this building , particularly the Tower Building , satisfies all aspects of health and safety legislation and whether it has a valid fire certificate . #% Aerospace and educational software and multimedia are the key industries and key technologies for the next century . #% I was one of 32 Members of this Parliament who took a private legal action before the French courts last year in a last-ditch attempt to get more tickets for fans across Europe . #% However , we do support projects that will encourage the development and supply of new-generation energy solutions . #% The Commission 's temporary bans have no legal basis . #% in writing . - As part of the current debate on the future of cohesion policy after 2013 , this resolution sets out the Parliament 's commitment to ensuring that the European Social Fund remains part of the overall strategy for cohesion funding . #% Mr President , a week ago the Ecofin Council rejected Parliament 's proposals for national declarations , which in effect means that we will not see a positive DAS in the foreseeable future . #% This is not simply because of our wounded self-esteem , but because the Member States left to themselves will quickly become obsessed with their own national power relationships . #% Although Parliament has taken steps to improve its budget and make savings , questions remain over some issues such as funding for prizes , which are currently paid for by the tax payer . #% All these things must be stopped . #% With that information I hope we can go forward to our group tonight and then vote positively . #% But now we understand fully what the EU is really all about . #% There will be some other amendments but I hope you will resist some of the complicated and abstruse concepts that have been put forward by some people which will make an inventor 's life far harder . #% We can safely say that previous enlargements of the EU have historically been a success story . #% We also have a problem in Germany , where there are centralised plants for treating catering waste , unlike the on-farm situation in the UK , which was not very satisfactory . #% I support the committee 's position which calls for clarity in the structures within the European Training Foundation , with three specific working groups : one for accession countries ; one for PHARE and TACIS countries ; and one for MEDA countries . #% It now seems , however , that the British Government will deny the British people that opportunity . #% I think the European Parliament 's behaviour on this , particularly latterly , has been a good democratic example for everybody . #% It is a country that is illegally occupied by China and its people are oppressed by that regime . #% Again nonsense , but it grabbed the tabloid headlines . #% That is a real retrograde step and an absolute shame . #% In its most recent report on these matters ( February 2011 ) , the Commission stated that Bulgaria needed to improve further the way the judiciary , police and other investigative bodies are structured , managed and cooperate . #% We have worked very hard in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs to produce a report that goes a very long way towards facing up to many of the injustices and abuses of human rights in our Community . #% If we do not look at what is happening with the global financial position then Europe , its investment , its potential for growth , all the risk capital action plan issues of the Lisbon European Council go by the by . #% However , we need to do much more and be more focused , as Mrs Wallström said , on achieving the concrete results . #% But even those three leftovers , as Mr Barnier underlined , are not subjects which are easy to handle . #% Once again , many congratulations to the rapporteur . #% The draft Council regulation on the early retirement of some 600 officials is under consideration at the moment . #% I have also been pleased to support an amendment from the Socialist Group to allow smaller companies to update their prospectus , if they so wish , with the filing of their annual report . #% Many businesses want to be able to set up European company statutes . #% This House should make it absolutely clear to President Nazarbayev , as both Mr Bertens and Mr Holm have said , that implementation of the PCA will depend on progress with the democratisation process and full respect for human rights , especially in the forthcoming local and parliamentary elections . #% But this is a big public health issue and I want to speak firstly from personal experience . #% As Conservatives we firmly believe in a realistic approach to energy policies and oppose adopting mandatory targets which have never been achieved in the EU up to now and therefore make little sense #% He may remember that I complimented him because he had written an article in a journal complimenting Parliament on rescuing the internal market . #% Those two countries and others have ensured that democracy and freedom can flower in Iraq , where perhaps in the past they would not have done so . #% The motto with this proposal is ` forward , but with a degree of prudence ' . #% Member States should also seriously consider promotion of funds through generous capital gains tax incentives to mitigate the risk to investors . #% Unfortunately , it is a very complicated idea , because a huge range of stakeholders need to come together -- the car industry , the telecoms industry , emergency services , public authorities -- to get this introduced on a coherent basis on a common platform . #% In September , along with a number of Members who are here tonight , I visited South Africa and two weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet the Deputy President in London . #% Nor should the Chief Executive C. H. Tung allow any erosion of Hong Kong 's Bill of Rights or Societies ' and Public Order Ordinances . #% You ignored referendums , you denied referendums , and you bullied the poor Irish into voting a second time . #% I wonder whether we could , in the future , whatever changes are to happen , take on board this difficulty ? #% Lastly , but not least , I salute the courage of the East Timorese people . #% Therefore , we should , as the international community , be seeking to support that democratic government in Indonesia . #% But let me be positive in supporting this report too , and in particular in supporting Amendments Nos 5 , 6 and 21 which have been accepted in full or in part in the common position . #% I do not cast any judgement over the previous speakers or the substance of their remarks , but , if people have been allocated a period of three minutes , to give them 50 % more is insulting to those people who have spoken earlier and have kept rigidly to their time . #% We do not want to see these rights increasingly restrained and constrained , so we will support the widest possible and strongest range of rights in tomorrow 's vote . #% The rights of Member States to reserve collection , sorting , transport and delivery of mail for the post offices that provide the universal service , and the principle of the price of sending letters remaining affordable for all , will go a long way to defending the interests of the postal consumers and the postal workers . #% And those who suffer at the end of the day are those in need of protection . #% But the Council should understand that Parliament must insist that reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the natural environment is properly protected from commercial interests otherwise tempted to think only of short-term gain . #% The overall majority wants the double majority system , yet one or two countries are holding out against it . #% In the current economic environment , it is more important than ever to justify expenditure on our priorities by tackling all wasteful and excessive spending in other sectors . #% 
The second point I raised was the suggestion that during what could be called a ` tumult ' or ` disturbance ' , the recorded votes should not count within the system . #% Mr President , following up the point that Mr Adam made , I presume you will report back at the beginning of the mini-session on the result and , of course , if there is a proposal for the establishment of a temporary committee this House will have to vote on it . #% The report also called for a review of Parliament 's expenditure in order to guarantee savings are made in future . #% This course of action will be another drain on taxpayers in the United Kingdom and other EU Member States , and one in which they have had absolutely no say . #% Speaking now as the rapporteur for Bulgaria , I especially welcome the parliamentary delegation from Bulgaria . #% Finally , since this code is a voluntary one , we want the Commission to monitor its implementation . #% We all agree that it is clearly strongly in our interests to help the Georgian peoples because they are our neighbours and we share a future . #% So to those such as Mr Bowe who say 1 % is a target that can easily be met , I say from experience that it can not easily be met . #% To increase it to 6.5 % would be crazy . #% Some Member States , including my own , have a well-established distribution system that allows medicines for which veterinary involvement is not considered necessary for safe and effective use to be obtained without a veterinary certificate . #% Finally , as regards clarity and democratic accountability : it is essential that all legislation passes the two tests of acceptability to the Council representing the States and acceptability to Parliament representing the citizens , a double guarantee as to the quality and acceptability of European legislation . #% I welcome the election result as an affirmation of democracy , even if doubts remain over all aspects of the social and economic programme espoused by President Yushchenko . #% However , our demands for public access were rejected . #% I therefore thank the Commissioner in advance for her reply to my questions . #% Article 7 ( 4 ) ( e ) says that they are keen to address the needs of specific social groups , in particular disabled people . #% It can not be that , a few months after the signing of an interinstitutional agreement on better law-making , the Commission fails , at the first hurdle , to honour the promises made in that agreement . #% I would not go as far as Amendment No 1 , as put forward by Mr Berenguer Fuster . #% Therefore there was a problem in counting the size of flocks in other Member States to work out the payments . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Manzella on an excellent report which , Mr President , has very faithfully carried out the request that you and the other group chairmen made earlier this year to have a more compact , efficient and transparent system for Parliament to express its views on the Commission 's legislative programme . #% I agree with Mr Crowley on the issue of risk equalisation in the private sector , to avoid cherry-picking of the purely profitable . #% I make no bones about the fact that I would have liked to have seen a more liberal directive , but the fact remains that what is on the table is a major step forward in the internal market . #% I would ask Mrs Schreyer if she can confirm that . #% By failing to allow votes on individual Commissioners , MEPs have been denied an important democratic right . #% But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful . #% Mr President , would you be prepared to agree with me that anonymous articles quoted in evidence are about as useless as statements by Mr Coates ? #% Nonetheless , there are areas where the code needs to be strengthened . #% We would also perhaps have liked to have a little bit more attention paid to the questions raised elsewhere in paragraph 4 of our resolution , particularly in the sixth indent where we refer to the creation of an environment where employers in the European Union are encouraged to take on workers . #% If not , the moral authority of the whole European Union on transparency and legitimacy is seriously weakened in the WTO . #% I want to draw attention to just three points . #% On individual rights , some progress was made but not enough . #% It is our longstanding position and that of the British Government that there is no need for such a centre , which would needlessly duplicate existing structures . #% This report is a sad catalogue of failure -- failure to direct enormous amounts of EU funds to where they were intended . #% I very much hope that the Socialist Group will change their mind , get their heads out of the sand and realise that this is the problem which we have to tackle and that it is better to do it now rather than later . #% My constituents live near a major international airport . #% Mr President , may I begin by congratulating the Luxembourg presidency on their efficiency and effectiveness . #% What chance is there , right now , of a stronger and more democratic set of institutions emerging from a revised Treaty ? #% He came to this position halfway through the year ; his attitude has been exemplary and he really deserves the congratulations of Parliament , not just the committee . #% The network will also provide direct access to the reports on domestic application of Community law produced by specific national authorities . #% Firstly , we oppose any legislation that assumes that women 's health , education and reproductive rights are the responsibility not of Member States but of the EU . #% We have had a range of workers , of all skill levels . #% In conclusion , let us stop interfering . #% Passing the hat round and trying to move things from pillar to post is not the model way of doing things . #% The best part of the Environmental Action Programme for me is the concentration on better implementation . #% As regards Article 14 I hope that the Council and Commission will progress the discussions . #% I could not support ` aggressive ' amendments which could have damaged the energy supply policy of a ` mixed ' approach leading to reduced CO2 emissions and the eventual growth in renewables . #% Furthermore , historically , citizens of any country -- and the UK in particular -- who in times of war went abroad and fought against their own armed forces or their allies were potentially indictable for treason , historically a capital offence and even today a very serious offence . #% So we are voting for the status quo as proposed by the Commission . #% And so it goes on . #% Doubtless these technical specifications will have been dreamt up by bureaucrats without the slightest experience of sea fishing and will therefore cause enormous problems for the people who have to have such experience and work on a daily basis . #% These are legal obligations to which the European Union and the Quartet have a duty to seek compliance . #% Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these , half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life . #% Can I now make some specific requests , firstly on the imminent Gaza Flotilla Mark II ? #% The importance of rethinking that old trade paradigm is crucial , not just for employment in the EU , but also for the survival of many developing countries ' industries as well , including some of the poorest in the developing world . #% On the Middle East , Iran has joined Saudi Arabia in accepting the principle of ` land for peace ' , if that is what the Palestinians want . #% I congratulate my French Conservative colleague , Mme Hermange , on her imaginative and constructive report . #% Asylum seekers are not parcels to be passed around : they are real human beings who may or may not be entitled to humanitarian protection but , in any case , need to be treated with respect and dignity . #% The evolution of governmental , ministerial and Heads of Government meetings that take decisions , which either de facto or de jure legislate or commit their component participants to legislate , should have a proper parliamentary angle and aspect . #% Parliament was right , then , to back the Commission . #% Mr President , could we have some clarity on this subject ? #% It is a historic challenge . #% I , like the rapporteur , want to ensure that this and other Erika measures are complied with . #% The final sites will be chosen by a panel of experts who will have specialist knowledge in this area and , as I have said before , we will particularly be looking at cross-border sites to promote the idea of Europe . #% Mr President , this report , in so far as it is a survey of the progress achieved to date in implementing a common foreign and security policy , has much to commend it . #% What price external relations then ? #% He does this against a backdrop of increasing nervousness in the agriculture , industry , trade union and other sectors in his country . #% But the Commission 's 120 mg target is in line with World Health Organisation proposals , and who am I to suggest that they should be challenged ? #% 
We in the United Kingdom have a workers ' registration scheme whereby individuals can register upon payment of GBP 70 ( EUR 100 ) , so that after 12 months they are entitled to draw social benefits . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement , which certainly reassures me . #% It is worth noting that , unlike Iraq , the Quartet is an example of how a common European foreign and security policy based on unanimity can actually work . #% It is regrettable that there have been administrative delays in producing all the language versions . #% I see it as an opportunity . #% What about the 60 % of people who live in small and medium-sized towns , innovation , transnational links ? #% Would you not accept that some of the issues now raised by the technical experts - and I particularly refer here to labelling , to improved diagnostic tests and so on - are incremental improvements in safety measures for Europe as a whole . #% Mr President , like Mr Bolkestein I would like to thank Mr Andria for his hard work on this most important of subjects . #% The report is based on the general assumption that there are a large number of chemicals that pose a threat to both human health and the environment , and ignores the positive health and environmental benefits to society arising form many man-made chemicals . #% The quantitative , as well as qualitative , returns that the EU would reap as a result of its commitment to training are unquestionable . #% It concerns electronic guidance , computer workstations and directions to rooms . #% If you wait until you are weak , you have to take much greater action and lay off more people . #% They are inappropriate or non-existent . #% Should there be any doubts we would have to say to Slovakia that it is not yet a member of the family of democratic nations . #% The greatest of Conservative prime ministers is supposed to have advised parliamentarians : ` never apologise , never explain ' . #% However , does he agree with me that we could , perhaps , further highlight some of the poorer Member States in terms of transposition by producing a league table of those least effective Member States - maybe a list of shame to try to ensure there is public pressure in the Member States concerned to ensure that Community law is complied with ? #% In that particular instance , we felt , as a committee , that this was not a proper instance for us to be , as it were , protecting immunity . #% We therefore feel that for the EU to ` become a party to the Convention ' as a whole is unnecessary and we oppose the EU acting in this State-like way . #% In a moment of weakness I said , ` no , not really ' . #% The British Ambassador was beaten up this morning , and the European Parliament should take strong action towards Burma , just as the ministers are doing . #% If we - you and I - want the public to understand and agree with the decisions we take , surely you agree with me that it must be done in public ? #% In the last 10 years I have heard many criticisms of it , including the lack of a level playing field , insufficient stakeholder involvement , inadequate balancing of economic , social and environmental imperatives and too much by way of micro-management from the centre . #% Human rights do not exist in isolation , they are connected to our development policies , our economic policies , our home affairs policies , indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions . #% Mr President , I speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market specifically on the European judicial network proposal . #% On the other hand , if one defines the polluter-pays principle , it is important that one does not just cast about to find some wretched victim who may have had some kind of association with what happened and heap all the liability on to him . #% This week Boeing has estimated that with this increase in numbers , there will be one major accident per week in 2010 . #% This is particularly the case in relation to Article 13 and Article 13 ( 2 ) primarily serving the first and Article 13 ( 5 ) the second aim . #% This is the plight of desperate people seeking desperate measures to start a new life . #% I sense , though , that you are competent and capable and dangerous , and I have no doubt that it is your intention to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the European nation states . #% The report itself states that the European economy is now used to functioning with an inadequate level of employment . #% We will continue to pursue this idea in two years time when the issue should return to us . #% The President-in-Office will be aware that at the Commonwealth Conference the foreign ministers agreed that if the promised return to civilian rule in Nigeria was not credible , then a mandatory oil embargo , a ban on airlines , an arms embargo and a freezing of financial assets would take place . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I would like to start by expressing thanks to the rapporteur on this issue for the integrity and openness with which he has approached the questions . #% Mr President , can you explain or give any good reason why the votes have been arbitrarily postponed to 11.40 , when previously they were announced for 11.30 ? #% The Left has got it wrong and for once Mr von Boetticher is right . #% In my own country we have had examples of both the former and now today the latter . #% Commissioner Barnier referred to the meeting in May in which many Members participated , but again nothing concrete seems to have come out of that meeting . #% We have now ended up with something that is compatible with the WTO and TRIPS , which ensures smooth running in the internal market , prevents fraud and counterfeiting , protects the consumer and does not underplay and undermine solid , long-established industries , such as the second biggest vodka producer in Europe - the United Kingdom - where in Scotland vodka is such an important industry . #% I respect the peaceful objectives of the Buddhist tradition of Tibet and realise that the rest of the world has much to learn from them . #% First of all , we must get this implemented properly and consistently in every Member State ; and secondly , it must result in a change of culture which says that it is simply no longer acceptable for large customers to exploit small businesses by paying them late . #% If we , as a European community , can not do something about this and deal with the women who are the victims of that trade , then it would be a poor thing if we do not make progress on this day . #% Parliament does not have the competence to instruct Member States on what to do in this area . #% It had a website - ` Europa ' or whatever it was , - but we have not heard much about it under this Presidency . #% Finally , on the Singapore issues : are you aware , Commissioner , that on Thursday the DTI Minister in the UK said that she would be seeking a meeting with you on the Singapore issues to ensure that you stick to the position that was taken in Cancún and that we will no longer press for negotiations at the WTO on investment and competition ? #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialists I welcome this report which will place serious and proper restrictions on a number of very dangerous substances that are now known to be toxic , mutagenic or carcinogenic to human beings . #% We have had a chat about this , but I want to hear you say it here tonight . #% In established democracies it is very easy for decisions to become remote and become the property of a political elite . #% It was felt that perhaps this was a rather hasty change to the Rules being put forward , for reasons that were not convincing for all of our Members . #% That is particularly important in the context of insurance companies investing their pension funds money . #% Mr President , we have received a document today from the services telling us what Members should do to prepare themselves for the move to the new IPE IV building . #% A ban would see the end of the tradition of barometer-making and craftsmanship , which began over 400 years ago when mercury barometers were first introduced . #% EU countries would buy on the open market or support their former colonies just as they wish , without repercussions on the world market . #% In this respect we should acknowledge and welcome the proactive role of the Commission in supporting the UN conclusions . #% Therefore , education in the context of a sophisticated manufacturing and entrepreneurial milieu in a society that requires frequent switches in skills basis and a society that requires mobility across borders , becomes a precondition , a predeterminant , of our success in a knowledge economy , not simply one of the results of its successes . #% There is absolutely no question if you look at every independent report that in environmental terms these fisheries deals off the west coast of Africa are the environmental equivalent of setting fire to the Serengeti ! #% What British farmers , and in particular farmers in the English West Midlands region that I represent , are looking for is a speedy resolution to this particular problem . #% Please , please do not mess up this time . #% OLAF alone has investigated cases with a value of EUR 144 million this year . #% If you doubt me , just look at the press photographs of the problems that occurred in Copenhagen last night . #% This was well before they , and their tragic country , became the focus of the world on 11 September , as the Taliban 's link with the perpetrators of the attack on the USA became clear to everybody . #% The process of which this debate is a part is , as has been explained already , a component of the so-called Amsterdamisation of the Brussels Convention . #% We must do a lot more and not leave that field to the Americans . #% We would be appealing in fact for the fundamental freedom of religious expression in Saudi Arabia . #% We never received assurances on this point and now we know why : European Union foreign ministers have decided cynically to side-step their own EU travel ban . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Meissner , for drawing together this report and developing it alongside the other political groups . #% Every participant will also have full access to health services and social security , therefore allowing as many of our young people as possible to become involved . #% 
It is discrimination which I call most strongly on the Commission and the President to oppose by making representations to the Spanish Government before the extradition deadline . #% However , at the moment there is no access to that ferry and the danger is that the drivers will be moved to Athens but still be subject to the blockade . #% Because of what you say and because of the difference in the testing procedures , which can not be agreed , it is going to take some time . #% Naturally , the professions have moved with the times themselves and several auditing firms have become global in their activity . #% Therefore , in the years before the ECB took charge of euro-zone monetary policy , the Bundesbank itself was not able to respect the growth of its money supply targets . #% The UNHCR estimates that over 400 000 people have already left Libya . #% Within the United Nations , the EU is actively involved in negotiations in New York to establish a new UN Human Rights Council . #% The motion also calls for positive action to end the appalling discrimination against , and exploitation of , women and children . #% Just before Easter , a number of MEPs from the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy went to California to see how investment works in Silicon Valley . #% Surely it should be the other way round . #% The way to deliver that low-cost Internet access , vitally important for the creation of a European E-economy to the people of Europe , is through liberalisation and free competition . #% We all know the present dire state of citizens ' knowledge about the organisation and policies of the EU . #% My last comment relates to the comments made by our Chair in the Committee on Budgets , Alain Lamassoure . #% Hence we welcome this initiative to create a user-friendly , extra-judicial network across Europe . #% If either steps back from this it is breaking faith with the electorate and is culpable of wrecking the process . #% I want to refer to three points . #% Despite this , the EU juggernaut carries on with its overbearing legislation , which only serves to destroy small businesses and removes freedom of choice from the consumer . #% I have to put to you : do you have the courage to act on your convictions and on this Parliament 's beliefs ? #% It is good that the Commission and the Council have accepted , because we have come forward with a compromise package for its acceptance . #% Our common aim tonight is to make sure the Erika and disasters like it never occur again . #% As Mr Bernard-Reymond is aware , my initial concern at his first draft report was that we were spending most of our time lecturing China . #% With the anthrax incidents in America , the attacks on the Japanese underground and the chemical attacks on the Kurds , we know that we are vulnerable if we do not take precautions against such bioterrorism . #% Both were obsessed with their own narrow vision of the unification of their continents . #% Terrorist extremists have committed the most vile acts and deliberately incited the emotions , prejudices , ignorance and anxieties of vulnerable peoples , particularly among the Islamic communities , and aroused the deepest fears among the Israelis . #% Parliament would also like greater emphasis in a number of areas . #% We must push this report through . #% One example is the figure of 16 , 000 quoted here , which is a wild exaggeration . #% Nonetheless , it is important for us to make a clear statement that we want to see reform of the Indonesia military . #% Nor were EU funds involved . #% I will not deal with that . #% We have to try to ensure that in all our policies we have as close a relationship with Russia as is possible . #% I know we still have some stumbling blocks and Europe and the world are not quite ready for that at the moment . #% It is a way of excluding Parliament , often from very important decisions . #% Finally , in a situation which should unify the disparate groups in the Colombian conflict for absolutely clear humanitarian reasons , I have to express disbelief at reports that paramilitaries may have used the disaster to cover the killing of human rights defenders in the NGOs in Colombia and that it may have been the pretext for withdrawing a bill condemning forced disappearances at an extraordinary session in the Colombian Parliament last week . #% The Commission officially operates national contact points under those guidelines , and I hope this commitment will also be reviewed . #% And we should not underestimate the enormous contribution of certain key , resolute individuals - Margaret Thatcher , Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II - to the eventual collapse of Soviet tyranny . #% We have hardly shown more than a passing interest in the way that we or other EU institutions spend EU taxpayers ' money . #% How can we be sure that meat cooked in Thailand has reached the correct temperature ? #% The Belgian Supreme Court has upheld a previous ruling that declares the Vlaams Blok a criminal organisation and effectively bans it . #% We do not support all aspects of the initiative . #% Successful negotiation requires preparation and hard work . #% I was interested - but not surprised - to note that this was the third largest claim in the history of the solidarity fund , the claim being EUR 4.6 billion and the allocation being to the sum of EUR 162.8 million . #% But just as we often debate in this Chamber problems of abuse of human rights and of conflict , let us also give positive recognition to continuing moves towards peace and democracy in many African countries . #% Then it emerges that one of the Latsis-owned shipyards -- the Lamda Shipyard -- received a EUR 10 million grant , and then Mr Barroso resigns the shipping portfolio . #% I want to talk specifically about jobs , competitiveness and the internal market . #% Mr President , you are right that we must investigate transparency and accountability . #% I recognize the work that has been done by the Commission in this , and particularly welcome the decision taken in July by the Budget Council to introduce diagonal communication between the EEA , Switzerland and the Central and Eastern European countries . #% I would like to put on record my objection to legislation of such importance to European citizens being put on the agenda in the late evening . #% We believe that the upper safe levels are sufficient to make the difference between foods and medicines even clearer . #% In UKIP , we take no side on Mr Buttiglione 's comments whatsoever . #% The proposal before us talks of information on the euro , but we already have all the information we need . #% In the autumn , we lobbied in New York for the appointment of a new Assistant Secretary-General to raise the priority for human nights in the UN , and next month we will once again be at the Human Rights Council itself : not simply in dialogue with our EU representatives , but also working with third countries as part of Europe 's common efforts to promote respect for human rights with the rest of the world . #% We do not need to go into why this fear has arisen and who stirred it up , if anybody has stirred it up . #% That is one of the most important dimensions of where the European Union is going in future to protect the interests of its citizens . #% If Amendments 19 to the Prets report and 14 to the Ilvari report are carried , we will have real problems when it comes to the conciliation . #% Thirdly , we must build on the Montreal Protocol as far as the export of GMOs is concerned , and this should be done on the basis of mutual agreement and transparency . #% However , we are not convinced that one form of discrimination should be countered with another form of discrimination , namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee women elected places . #% We believe in a system that is based on private enterprise , with some regulation , and with some ownership of public utilities , whilst they would , presumably , believe in much more state ownership . #% The President had to call upon Members to stop talking and take their seats to allow the Commissioner to finish her response . #% I thoroughly endorse the Chairman 's guidance to us , as team captains so to speak , to make sure that we vote conclusively together tomorrow to withhold the necessary money and urge those countries to spend it properly . #% I do not want to go back over the issue of the Constitution and the referendum results , but I believe that it is now very difficult for the Constitution to be taken forward in its present form . #% We all hope that the situation in Iran can be resolved peacefully , and this is certainly one of those cases where the West needs both to speak softly and to carry a big stick . #% I will be particularly interested in what the social fund does because I foresee a framework there that will provide employment aids and aids for the self-employed . #% I ask them to revisit that before it is too late . #% The world 's most populous country deserves what we enjoy in Europe . #% Mr President , on the same point in the Minutes . #% 
Mr President , the dramatic fall from power of President Aristide in Haiti and the undemocratic and increasingly repressive measures by President Chávez of Venezuela to thwart the will of his people to hold a recall referendum represent a worrying trend in Latin America , as Aristide becomes the sixth democratically elected leader in that region to be ousted from power since 1999 . #% Could it be recorded , please ? #% It is quite clear that substantial funds are going to be needed to ease these countries ' transition . #% I welcome the Commissioner 's statement and particularly its measured and considered nature . #% It is also about successful business , which is a core and mainstream part of the economy . #% I hope Parliament , in amending this directive , will do so in the light of sound scientific advice , not as a knee-jerk reaction to tabloid newspaper scare stories . #% We must , for example , help switch high-volume , long-distance freight away from the road onto the railways where it belongs . #% I wish to draw attention to some other rather unwelcome visitors on our premises . #% The truth is that the directive is flexible . #% We must rejoice in that and we must make sure that our programme contains significant elements to deal with that . #% We must develop efficient and effective complementary national policies but we must ensure the policies remain common to us all and we must retain common financing . #% It is such important information that it would be very valuable . #% If we truly believe that - and I hope we do - how can we then not take the next logical step and condemn those governments which ignore arms controls ? #% Inevitably , as enlargement approaches reality , the voices of doubters are beginning to be heard . #% Mr President-in-Office , I apologise to you and the Presidency itself for being late . #% Well , they might as well , as Mrs Jackson has said . #% Also , when the Council adds provisions to Commission proposals in common position , they should be properly costed too ? #% There will be small amounts left and it is fair to say that even without the problems we have had we could still have had those small amounts of money left . #% In the last century , this principle was thought to be so important that if you look in your own back yard , you will see the graves of many British soldiers who went to defend that very principle , on which you now seem to have turned your back . #% Under your Presidency the old question of whether Europe can ` widen ' and ` deepen ' at the same time , which is one that plagued most of your predecessors , has been answered decisively and positively . #% Premature changes to the rules can only cause confusion , though it is clearly useful for the Commission and Council to take note of Parliament 's views at this time . #% The development of a plan for a bio-Europe - paralleling the e-Europe - for activities of the Commission and Member States to make the Union a competitor for the biotechnology industry is a worthy aim . #% I would just like to add , since you are about to announce a White Paper on food safety , that , whatever people say , food right across Europe can never be 100 % safe . #% I have to say , as usual , that I have never heard so much nonsense talked in my life as I have today . #% It is because there has been better training in larger companies and appropriate notices , none of which are obvious within smaller companies . #% The term ` politically neutral ' would be far more acceptable . #% As with that report , it is essential to appreciate just how important deep-water coral reefs are for the marine ecosystem . #% The decision to pause for reflection on the Constitution merely underlines a lack of direction across Europe . #% We must consider these products , the level of risk they present , their contact with human beings and the places where they are used . #% Unfortunately , poppies grow extremely well in drought . #% I would like to pay tribute to the Dutch Government for the way in which it hosted the Assembly in The Hague . #% If we merely have , if you like , the stick approach and no carrots , then I am afraid we are going to find it more difficult to reach these standards and , at the same time , increase suffering in some of the very small enterprises in the UK county hardest hit by job losses , when we are actually spending considerable sums of money trying to create jobs there . #% . -- Mr President , there is clearly a very real problem of social exclusion for many people in many of the new Member States . #% But it is also important for NGOs and other key partners to have a sense of where we are content with our performance and where we ourselves want to do more . #% It is a pity we did not combine that heat in our committee with some power while we were at it . #% Great progress has recently been made in Spain on a vaccine against malaria , but at the moment Bill Gates and other private foundations are putting a great deal more money into this than international bodies . #% That phrase was very much paralleled and echoed by the Council when talking about the need for ` social justice ' . #% A radical suggestion maybe , but it would allow competition from the more lightly regulated economies to provide the spur for lighter regulation elsewhere and we shall all prosper . #% This event , which was efficiently and successfully organised under the auspices of the Philippine Senate , concluded , as a number of colleagues have said , by issuing an agreed communiqué and statements which dealt with human rights , with special reference to women and children , terrorism and the environment . #% If 95 % or more is spent then a tick is put beside that item . #% Regulations are far worse than directives because they pass into UK law and bypass the UK Parliament . #% All reporting of opposition parties is negative , with the MDC a particular target . #% Mr President , one of the things that impressed the world most in terms of global environmental action was the Montreal Protocol - the agreement , that was unique at that time , between 24 nations to work towards a ban on CFCs . #% Parliament is happy to go along with that , provided there are substantial guarantees as regards the oversight of such delegated powers . #% Lastly , I ask that the flexes and loose wires in our offices be looked it . #% I spent three days in Tokyo talking with Japanese parliamentarians , the Environment Minister and a number of other ministers . #% Airports in my constituency of North-East England , such as Newcastle and Durham Tees Valley , are popular with amateur pilots and , increasingly , business people . #% The NKVD , the Soviet Union 's People 's Commissariat of Internal Affairs , under Order No 001223 , entitled ` On the operative accounting of anti-Soviet and socially alien elements ' , issued on 11 October 1939 , was the prelude to the mass deportations ordered by Merkulov , the USSR 's People 's Commissar for State Security , and put into effect by his deputy , Serov . #% Yes , quite clearly , when the Community Action Plan in response to our parliamentary resolution on the 1998 discharge said : `` Since health and education will receive more emphasis , the implication is that a greater amount of financing than in the past would be dedicated to these sectors . '' #% In addition , the European Parliament has a role to play , through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , in particular . #% This ruling spells despair for many ACP countries . #% That is why Europe has a particular responsibility to do something about it . #% Mr Blair , you might also might want to use some of your goodwill with Turkey to resolve the Armenia embargo and border issue . #% Let me speak plainly . #% I hope that the Commission will give some account to the symbols that might highlight smaller nations like Wales . #% Commissioner , first it was textiles , now it is shoes , next it will be furniture . #% In my view , the best way for the aspirations of this report to become reality is to ensure that the EU encourages innovation and technological development rather than throwing regulatory obstacles in the way . #% Hong Kong and its people have succeeded in turning the territory into a vibrant economy of world class standards . #% So what the developing countries of the world need is not to follow the example of the quasi-Marxist European Union . #% This is in line with the soft landing ahead of the milk quota system in 2015 , as envisaged in the CAP Health Check . #% Mr President , I should like to express my concern that nobody in the French presidency can read any of the European languages apart from French . #% I would like to focus my contribution to this debate on the very essence of what the proposal means to people in my constituency , which I am sure is mirrored across the whole of the European Union . #% But Tom said something about the Budgets Committee wanting to spoil this report because it is involved in bean counting . #% One wonders whether , when only half the money is being spent on the Erasmus places being taken up , ( half are left open at the end of each year ) the money could not be better redistributed within Erasmus itself . #% Some , of course , will continue to merit full discussion and voting in plenary ; but perhaps some really do not . #% Madam President , I too would like to add my voice to those who have thanked Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Van Lancker for their considerable work on this . #% 
We would much rather see a free trade deal across Europe , rather than the Treaty of Rome and all that has come since . #% That is one of the many reasons why the United Kingdom should stay out of the euro . #% In the meantime I would like to take the opportunity to look beyond the institutional and legal basis arguments and look at the implications these proposals might have for the development of the social economy in a European Union which is trying to deal with a range of profound changes . #% Fuel costs will go up by at least 10 % - another burden for hard-pressed farmers to carry at a time when they can least take it . #% And a Union that is frightened to reinforce its liberal and parliamentary character will be an unattractive Union for the acceding Member States and an unreliable player upon the world stage . #% Maybe then we would have some progress . #% There is no question that this House and the other European institutions will be taking their responsibilities to the people of Europe seriously when they approve this legislation tomorrow . #% The President of the Commission said that the common agricultural policy has been solved . #% Are we going to persist with this issue , or are we going to lay it aside with a regretful sigh while the power of those who own the rights and jealously maintain them is extended , and while the audio-visual artists remain confined in the shadows ? #% If Commissioner de Silguy considers 1 % over a period of nearly five years a success then , if this was a national parliament , perhaps many Members would be asking for his resignation . #% This is a valuable , sustainable industry , very important to the economy of Europe and to our environment , and this is a very timely report . #% In Vietnam , there is a market-Leninist state with a strong reformist movement leading to gradual improvements . #% However , it is vital that Serbia 's progress is reciprocated and rewarded by the EU and its Member States , for example , now by ratifying the SSA , not least because some of Serbia 's neighbours , such as Croatia , are far more advanced on the road to EU accession . #% I urge support for the amendment setting out this programme . #% It is all too rare that we get a very specific response from Commissioners to questions in an oral question . #% I also saw a film crew yesterday along the corridor filming some of our employees moving a trunk . #% I am happy to say that I stand before you today to ask Parliament to endorse a compromise text , as this House requested of me in November 2000 . #% The total for our share of the budget is approximately EUR 600 million , a lot of money until you divide it by 370 million people - less than 1 % of our budget , not a bottomless pit . #% Theoretically , the G8 governments are committed to achieving the UN development targets by 2015 , including universal primary education . #% They can not . #% My view is that it was an absolute democratic disgrace that , at the recent Brussels Summit , all 25 Heads of State and Government agreed to end the period of reflection and to begin to implement the Constitution against the wishes that the Dutch and French people expressed in their referendums last year . #% A communication later this year will give full details . #% That is very good , but it has left two fundamental problems . #% I wish to express my dismay and disgust at those actions . #% I have a strong antipathy to many aspects of what is described as economic modernisation , to neo-liberal policies , to deregulation and privatisation . #% Could I just formally ask you for a separate vote on Amendments Nos 2 , 11 , 23 and 24 ? #% It is obviously an issue that is not going to go away . #% Are we only paying lip-service to a link between the CAP and a cleaner , better environment ? #% Earlier Mr Camre spoke against support for poorer countries . #% I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage . #% Our hosts were gracious and hospitable , we had useful discussions and we have a huge amount in common . #% This proposal never came , but Stephen Hughes and I did not give up the fight . #% I hope he can confirm what he said . #% Commercial bank loans are how many small - to medium-sized businesses attract finance . #% My final point is that the report also welcomes the proposal to codify and simplify existing Community legislation in this field , so long as that is not coded language for deregulation for deregulation 's sake . #% I have a very positive vision of a Europe of nation states working ever more closely together . #% The parallel negotiations which will be going on at the WTO and between the ACP and the European Union must be used as an opportunity to show that the European Union clearly understands that trade and market access and tariff levels are directly and inextricably linked to our understanding of how we meet those critical millennium development goals . #% One of the important things that we will be bringing forward to the Parliament is a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour . #% The worst of the crisis is in southern Somalia , in central areas such as Galcaio , which was devastated at the peak of the troubles and is now being rebuilt , even with street lighting being reinstalled . #% Finally , the barrier is the staffing of the Commission . #% Indeed , my colleague Mrs Bachelot-Narquin has been very active in this regard and I thank her for that . #% Sadly , we have come to expect totally misleading and sensational press releases from the right , misrepresenting important pieces of health and safety legislation . #% Chancellor Bismarck once famously remarked that the whole of the Balkans were not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier . #% It is not an attempt to move toward some kind of Europe-wide minimum wage . #% I would begin by once again congratulating the President-in-Office for his firmness over this issue of Kosovo and the clarity with which he has led the European Union during his time in office . #% We must look at that very closely . #% This represents an explicit recognition that human rights and political freedoms are suppressed in Belarus . #% Suddenly we have a Labour British Prime Minister talking about low growth in Europe , talking about unemployment in Europe , talking about the failure of European economic policies and common policies . #% And what chemicals have they been given as well ? #% One of the problems with modulation is that there is genuine concern that it will not be fair across the board . #% They are guidelines and they have strenuously resisted what so often happens if people try to turn the guidelines into some sort of advance and premature first reading . #% I know we have a trialogue and a conciliation before their first reading but it is a problem we have to resolve before the Council 's first reading . #% I understand the force of what he says when he reminds us again that the internal audit activity , the examination of contracts , was a direct product of the discharge resolution drafted , in fact , by Mr Casaca himself and some of his close colleagues . #% I think , however , that the Commissioner may be about to announce to us that light is dawning and that we can see a way forward that will enable both sides to be satisfied and to allow sensible negotiations to continue for a global solution . #% in writing . - I support the retention of the national veto in matters of foreign affairs and I am increasingly concerned about the growing role of the EU on the world stage despite the fact that the Lisbon treaty has not been ratified . #% The new Reception Directive is a development of the EU 's common immigration and asylum policy as laid out under the Lisbon Treaty . #% Finally , the text of Article 4 was the matter I referred to in my opening remarks . #% Ladies and gentlemen , your tax systems are under threat . #% Whilst exalting the successful moves on agriculture we must not overlook the fact that much will be cancelled out by an undermining of the right of developing countries to protect their basic services and emerging industries . #% It is our duty to support this report and to support the youth programmes . #% Imagine the language if workers were told to cover up when they were trying to get a sun tan from their holiday . #% We should not just help the big battalions who can , of course , accept all of the high evaluation costs . #% Bangladesh must facilitate the re-admission of nationals who are illegally in the territory of an EU Member State . #% The same arguments apply . #% You know , Schiller wrote ` Ode to Joy ' in 1785 , and his words ` Oh friends , no more these sounds ' , may have been controversial then , given that Beethoven was unfortunately already disabled by deafness when he wrote the Ninth Symphony , but they are appropriate today . #% As far as Mr van Buitenen is concerned , he took up employment on 1 April in the Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection in Luxembourg in a very responsible job , as the House would expect . #% 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , we listened with great interest to Commissioner Šefčovič who seemed more interested in placating the Council than in seriously attacking the position of the Parliament . #% Taxpayers in the European Union have the right to expect parliamentarians to have a clear understanding of the costs of establishing new European agencies . #% Mr President , I am sorry to see , judging from what previous speakers have said , that talks between the SPD and the CDU on forming the Grand Coalition are not progressing so smoothly . #% Others have been confused into imagining that ESDP is primarily about encouraging European countries to make a greater contribution to defence . #% Indeed , measured as a percentage of per capita GDP , this package can be seen as among the most generous that has been offered to an accession country , although this needs to be kept in perspective as Bulgarian per capita GDP is low . #% But since you took over , we have seen Greece reduced to nothing more than a protectorate . #% Developing countries should implement the ILO Convention to achieve a level playing field and to carry on the struggle against world poverty . #% China is the EU 's third largest trading partner outside Europe , which makes the Chinese market particularly important for European shipping interests . #% I have to say , after hearing what Mr Martinez had to say , that I am deeply concerned that BSE may now be transmitted to human beings . #% Last year , it was EUR 179 million , which is not much of an improvement over four years . #% Finally , we must fight the disease in conjunction with the farming communities , not in spite of them . #% If this is the court , the jury is a loaded one . #% I think we need to show much more understanding of the real reasons for the so-called urban drift from rural areas and of the effect of the systems and structures which conspire to destroy the livelihoods of millions who live by the land . #% All these acts should be stopped and every effort by the government should be made to counter them and those responsible should , if possible , be brought to book . #% Secondly , linked to the matter of the financial perspective is one of the questions that we put down on the approval of posts . #% As far as the note I have here is concerned , we are talking about the fact that this group has been set up to deal specifically with the complaints that have been received . #% It is true to say that development policies must be partly geared to trying to combat poverty to provide people with a workable , reasonable alternative to moving themselves and their families to other parts of the world . #% Then if you read the account of barriers to trade by the European Commission office they say : ' Do you know the Americans have the impertinence to produce Californian champagne and Californian claret etc. ? ' #% They formulated that agreement . #% I know there is a derogation for Member States to push this back for five years in this area , and I hope they will not use that . #% Many however , are increasingly alarmed that Bulgaria 's accession is being caught up in the wider controversy over the future extent of the EU and over the EU budget . #% To save time I therefore turn to the concluding part of the question put by Mr Harbour and Madam Guy-Quint relating to budgetary matters . #% When sentenced to ear amputation , the prisoner had to seek out and pay the surgeon to perform the mutilation . #% But that vitality and growth are achieved by free enterprise , encouraging initiative and adopting the use of the new technologies . #% Let us turn those tools against them . #% How many of you , when you last had your gas or electricity bill , turned it over to look at the small print - the conditions ? #% That is why the Liberal Group in this Parliament is the only one that is actually facing reality and saying that the public subsidization of fishing agreements has to stop . #% Madam President , at this hour brevity is a duty and not a virtue . #% The Socialist Group therefore welcomes the Commission proposal to facilitate the addition of new species to the list of recognized species . #% One thing that we need to avoid is for the Member States to be out of pocket as a result of this measure . #% Perhaps minimum targets for each material is not a bad idea . #% That fact needs greater recognition in this House . #% I would also like to congratulate the Danish Presidency for establishing an indicative framework for further agricultural spending which in no way prejudices future reform of the CAP , nor future discussions on financing the European Union , nor our international trade commitments in the Doha round . #% First of all , I am mightily relieved that we have got the vote through . #% But , if this option is removed , we are in a situation where the pets in the animal world will suffer because people will not be able to afford to go to a veterinary surgeon , for example , to get a worming pill for a cat . #% It needs to create more jobs in hydroelectric power for export , and financial services may well be another solution . #% There have been legal challenges in Member States and , indeed , similar legislation had to be repealed in Canada because of a constitutional challenge . #% I helped to organise the first protest demonstration in London against the 1973 coup and I have never forgotten the heart-rending stories told by some of the refugees who came to Britain of suffering , of losses , of relatives barbarously killed . #% Is it the case that you , Commissioner , have publicly called for the executive secretary and chief EPA negotiator in CAEMC to be dismissed ? #% I believe it is necessary to allow this increased amount of funding to be used to deal with the problems , wherever bottlenecks occur on the ground , regardless of transport mode , not according to the Commission theory of certain modes being better than others . #% We now have a minister who will sit here for three hours or so in a budgetary debate , as we had last year , which says a lot about the Council . #% It is my personal opinion that if the industry wants to have a long-term future in a stable legislative and economic environment it must learn the lessons of the past and conduct itself in an open and transparent manner with the highest concern for public safety . #% I hope this Parliament will now look at the implications for taxation on those products which are manufactured using energy . #% I suspect that the small number of Members of this House who have kept in touch with the plant , both the management and the workers ' representatives there over a good number of years , felt the issue more keenly than most . #% I therefore endorse those colleagues who have said that we should have a strong parliamentary presence . #% We recognise that a minimum standard of treatment of workers in the workplace is important and are pleased that the European Parliament is raising awareness of the issue , but we feel that this standard should relate to both men and women and that specific recommendations relating to employment contracts and childcare , for example , do not fall within the EU 's sphere of responsibility . #% I think he makes the Commission slightly more impotent by admitting that Commissioners currently have no political responsibility . #% Things do not work like that because of the majorities that now exist within this Parliament . #% My own constituency of East Anglia has lost Tornado aircrew from Royal Air Force Marham in Norfolk . #% Because homelessness is part of a complex multi-dimensional pattern of disadvantage , it requires a coordinated approach from public authorities , an approach which is sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the homeless , which takes account of the fact that homeless people need jobs , schools and health services and an income as well as a home . #% Again , we need a programme of education that matches the best practice across the whole of Europe . #% So thank you for that information , Commissioner . #% Malnutrition in pregnancy causes high mortality rates and , by increasing the chances of vitamin deficiency , leads to disabilities . #% However , when I look at how the political will has been lacking , how the corporate interests have interfered and how the WTO has procrastinated , what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission . #% This was a deal - I want to say this before going on to a word of warning - that meets Parliament 's principal concerns . #% The cause for concern here is that it is a failure by the Commission to respond to the Committee on Petitions -- now in total as opposed to an individual Member . #% I am sure he will understand if I concentrate the rest of my remarks on the revenue side of the budget . #% She once said that to come out and declare your sexuality is to be a hero . #% Action is particularly essential in light of the fact that these fish live a long time , grow slowly and have low reproductive capacity . #% We saw a situation recently in the Horn of Africa where Ethiopia - where we saw terrible scenes of starving children a few years ago - is actually exporting grain to Kenya . #% I suspect not , and I ask why the Czech Republic is treated differently . #% The European Union has not taken concerted action to address the multidimensional issues , the causes and consequences of poverty . #% The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in European women , as we have heard , is one in ten , and it is the biggest killer of women between the ages of 35 to 59 , and the second biggest overall . #% There is also a data protection problem . #% Mr Maat handled this with skill , but on such a high-profile issue the amendments tabled before Parliament calling for even tighter conditions were to be expected . #% It is time to match the rhetoric about fighting money laundering with tough action . #% 
Spending on cultural activity is important . #% What was happening 15 years ago in Austria was that Mr Haider was actually persecuting the Slovene-speaking minority there . #% We naturally wish to pursue best practice wherever that is feasible and gains the endorsement of the legislatures , including this House . #% Mr President , the renewal of the Sustainable Development Strategy is very welcome , but it must become more focused . #% Without that first step being taken , then others can not follow . #% In such circumstances the Council and Parliament must negotiate a Statute which meets both of their requirements . #% This report was originally due to be voted on in the February part-session , but the major political groups quite reasonably agreed to delay this for a month , to give time to try to improve it . #% It will give the Budgetary Control Committee an opportunity to consider the wording of the amendment and , if necessary , to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights and alter the wording accordingly , in which case a report could go forward with general support . #% The Swedish prime minister once again reiterated the importance of human rights during the Swedish Presidency . #% Therefore , my British Conservative colleagues and I have abstained on this report . #% Commissioner Frattini says there is no evidence , but what has he done to try and find out ? #% In the meantime , we ask the Council and Commission to raise these questions firmly at the next meeting between the Council , the Commission and the government of Kazakhstan . #% I think the President-in-Office neatly side-stepped my question . #% We in Europe and the United Nations need to press for this indigenous Iraqi community , like the Kurds , Sunnis and Shia , to have their own administration area within a united Iraq , as mentioned in the Iraqi constitution . #% Mr President , for as long as mankind has been here on earth , he has been polluting . #% Let us , as Mr Nassauer said , focus on what is really essential for our European citizens and then think about enlargement , if necessary , a little bit further on . #% Could the Commissioner tell me whether she accepts that the KONVER programme has a legitimate aim , and that she would like to see those aims fulfilled in whatever programme takes place after 1999 ? #% We expect no-one to take anything on credit or on trust . #% He has found an effective compromise and I hope our own amendments in the IMCO Committee , of which he is also a distinguished member , will support that . #% With so many people developing breast cancer , we must get that right . #% So what I think should happen is that we do negotiate and reach an agreement on what would be sensible , which would be to fix an early date for the Commission to be replaced , on condition that the new Commission has the full legitimacy of going through the full procedure by the new house to be elected in the European elections . #% Now we have a classic conflict between the Parliament , which has made it clear that it wants an end to animal testing , and the Council , which has done its best to ensure that no marketing ban is introduced . #% I should also like to thank the President-in-Office for his very full answer and , indeed , thank the German presidency for trying to review the whole sorry duty-free saga . #% the number and responsibilities of Commissioners #% The first part of paragraph 10 which we support makes that absolutely clear . #% This is the first directive that we are debating under Article 13 and it is a very good start in our fight against all discrimination across the EU . #% As I understand it , Amendment 1 , by the UEN Group , just consists of the words ` the German ' instead of ` Hitler 's ' . #% I call upon the Italian government to use the opportunity afforded by the sad death of Queen Marie-José to fulfil its legal obligations to the European Union and grant the two male princes the same rights as every other Italian citizen and let them go home . #% We must make certain that these provisions are presented in such a way as to ensure that terrorists do not enter EU territory via the asylum procedure . #% Secondly , by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed of the position taken by the representatives of the European Community in the organs of the Energy Community Treaty , such as the Permanent High Level Group ? #% The Commission talks about this being driven by demand from outside the EU and clearly it has taken into consideration the recent developments in Asia . #% The cost to farmers from the reduction of the value of the UK beef herd and by-products , along with the extra regulation , is estimated to be GBP 1000 million . #% A democratic state is not just a gift and right , it is a responsibility . #% Are they the organisations that we ought to be legislating against ? #% I refer particularly to the points about asylum and immigration with regard to the United Kingdom , which is not perfect on these issues , but which is faced with a real challenge . #% Poor African entrepreneurs have said to me they want access to capital markets in order to borrow money to buy a tractor so that they can plough the fields and create more wealth locally , so let us give them that ability and access to capital . #% I also welcome the openness with which Mr Lamy has commenced his working relationship with this new Parliament , and I also welcome his support for changes to the Treaty in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the common commercial policy . #% Let us recognise that de facto they form our constitution . #% Time after time the mantra comes up that there will be a reference to EFSA , that it will do this or that . #% Concerning the eurozone crisis , however , we are told that , to avoid similar crises in the future , the Union needs powers to call for the prior presentation of draft budgets by sovereign governments and to impose tougher sanctions on Member States - but budget information was already supposed to be available ; it was just inaccurate and poorly scrutinised . #% All the Member States do it , cooperating with each other and with other friendly democratic countries . #% There were fundamental points raised on a budget about which I feel passionately . #% Opinion polls show that the majority of people support the idea that environmental issues are important and should be dealt with at European level . #% My point is that this type of flexibility is needed if we are to continue to have a decent average . #% They will be told that once upon a time , Europe was divided ; there was a big wall down the middle of it and the people in the East were very poor and they had no democracy , and they lived under an evil system called Communism that killed millions of its own people . #% That is the only way we will get healthy competition . #% Surely , he would agree that development is about helping developing countries to help themselves . #% Nevertheless Mr Skinner 's suggestion of a one-stop shop risk capital website to facilitate the interface of SMEs and the finance-providers is a very good one . #% It was clear that we can no longer take a passive approach . #% It is clearly a complex and extremely demanding process . #% If he does agree , will he do something about it ? #% Let me tell colleagues now that if that happens , any notion of EU-wide data protection is absolutely and fundamentally lost . #% But we hope that , through the open coordination method , solutions to difficult issues , such as finding best practice for legal entry for asylum seekers and other immigrants , will be found . #% It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called `` negative priorities '' and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity . #% Finally , I would say that we have some concerns about the way in which the agencies have been handled . #% The Commission is aware of the recent trial referred to by the honourable Member in his question and of the sentence imposed on Mr Liu , who assisted Xu Wenli in setting up a branch of the banned China Democracy Party . #% That reinforced our view that the pay scale is appropriate , reasonable and relevant to the role of the Commission and to the demands upon its staff and that in some respects improvement is necessary and justified . #% Will they legislate without counting the cost ? #% For a long time many of us who have wanted reconciliation in Cyprus with due regard to the interests and concerns of both communities have called for some serious confidence-building measures on the part of the international community in relation to Turkish northern Cyprus . #% In the initial stages of liberalisation , a lot of people lost their jobs , those who remained had to work longer hours and others suffered a deterioration in their working conditions . #% What will you say to the Slorc , who have been given official observer status at that Conference - much to the disgust of the international community ? #% Madam President , we are delighted that at long last we have received the McMillan-Scott report in plenary . #% It is to bring about the disarmament of Saddam Hussein 's regime so that he is no longer a threat to us or indeed to his regional neighbours . #% Mr President , it is very appropriate that we are debating these two very good reports only a few days before the Euro-Med Forum , which is due to sit next week . #% We also need to be aware of the position on the free movement of people within the European Union , which is one of our fundamental principles . #% Sure enough it was not long enough - he exceeded it by almost a minute and still had not said half the things he wanted to say . #% 
I suggest to the House that this is not a time to go back - this is a time to move on , to move forward . #% Prevention is crucial and environmental concerns such as the sound management of natural resources like forests and wetlands are key tools in the evasion of disasters , lessening their impact on people , homes and livelihoods . #% The only significant difference in the common position compared with the first reading position is that the implementation date has been put back by one year . #% Finally , as regards the codes of conduct , we need to know that promotion will be on merit and that promotion at the highest levels of the Commission will involve managerial competence , which has not always been the case up to now . #% I attended two of those which were the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% I also would like to ask the Commission what resources , particularly staffing , will be dedicated to the important task of delivering the aims of this very important communication . #% That office controls and inspects the food , feed , animal welfare and plant health of the European Union : of Member States , Accession States and countries across the world from French Polynesia to the Falklands . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , violence against women , especially in the domestic environment , is an issue that needs to be debated and I congratulate the Chair of the FEMM Committee for bringing it to the forefront . #% There has been no real cross-examination ; they are not under oath ; we have not been able to subpoena them ; and there is the practical problem that flows from the inevitable requirement of interpretation . #% In the answers you have already given , you have given some indication of that . #% The other major problem that occurred from that two-day hearing , and probably the biggest one , was the fact that we had asked for a political signature from the Member States to actually give these national declarations . #% It was a political assassination . #% Apparently this was not possible for procedural reasons . #% The United Kingdom contributed disproportionately to the success of this enterprise . #% Both are absolute disasters . #% From a consumer standpoint , the obstacles to the development of international trade lie primarily in the lack of certainty surrounding post-contractual relations . #% Mr President , if any good came out of the events of 11 September - and it would be a brave person who said it did - I would single out two things . #% Equal pay for equal work must be properly implemented in Member States in order to get a fair deal for women . #% The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening , and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics , and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear , because this report is a radical one . #% As I said earlier , we had really hoped to get a first-reading agreement . #% We are still gathering research on the full impact of trawling on deep-sea coral reefs , but it certainly appears that in the short span of time since deep-sea trawling began , hundreds or possibly thousands of seamounts and coral reef systems may have been devastated . #% Of course we recognise that new Member States have a right to a Commissioner as from day one of their membership of the European Union . #% Organic products come in all shapes and sizes , but the EU can not accept that . #% I am sorry , however , that my amendment on CIA flights was not accepted by the committee , but I note Amendment 5 , which seeks to rectify this situation . #% I note the Commission 's estimate , quoted by Mr Bébéar , that illegally acquired funds deposited in mostly foreign banks amount to more than half of African 's external debt . #% We urge the Commission and the finance ministers to do so . #% But what of respected companies that have applied quite properly for state aid , received no answer from the British Government due to delays from the Commission in giving the green light , and have then relocated to another part of the EU , which fits in better with Brussels ' idea of cohesion and is , therefore , completely free of the same obstructions ? #% Last year 's UNDP Arab human development report stated that -- subject to fieldwork surveys -- the appetite for democracy in the Arab world was , at 60 % , the highest of any region in the world . #% I believe that the European Union should put its democracy money where its mouth is and include in the instrument a reference to supporting democratic political groups . #% However , in addition to the lead he has taken , I would encourage him to put real effort into reducing the legislative output from the Commission itself . #% There are then two further amendments tabled by the ELDR Group and I have to say to the House that , whatever one thinks of those amendments , were they to be accepted it would jeopardise the possibility of having this measure brought forward by 2005 . #% If we talk about stamping out the illegal trade in bushmeat , all we will do is drive it underground and make it much more difficult to deal with . #% I disagree with the Commission on one point , however . #% Madam President , it might help the dignity of the House if the Member nearby could explain what happened . #% As my colleague Mrs Marinucci has set out , we , on this side , will maintain our approach taken in committee . #% It did not , either in tone or in content , demand explanations , offer criticism , seek to gag anyone or imply in any way that either Mrs Gradin , as a former Commissioner , or Mr Asp , as a former official , had no right to criticise the Commission as an institution . #% Mr President , ambition is a practical joke played by the gods on mankind . #% I am equally pleased that disabled people have been included generally , with a particular emphasis on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities . #% I finish as I started by thanking the rapporteurs . #% There are , however , two points that I have picked up : firstly the outgoing Commissioners complained that in practice they were unable to supervise the actions of their most senior officials , namely , their Directors-General . #% While it is acceptable to mention acquisition of knowledge of the host language as being fundamental to social integration , it goes too far to insist that this is a criterion for granting of EC residence status . #% In the course of this present decade Poland , Hungary , Slovakia and Romania will become European Union Member States . #% Whatever the United States may do by way of exemptions , we have a temporary ban which has been shown to work in terms of reducing the illegal trade , but we do not have a permanent ban , and it is we in Europe who are the major importers of wild birds , at 93 % - going on for a million a year until 2003 . #% People know that the Lisbon agenda is nothing more than a joke and that the economic model in the European Union is simply not working . #% However , having said that , you could quite conceivably produce wonderful , simple legislation , yet it could be completely destroyed by the way that Member States implement it and enforce it . #% Taking those factors into account and in specific answer to the question before the House , the Commission considers that our reform strategy does not require that we request a revision of the ceiling of Heading 5 and we will not make such a request . #% author . - Mr President , this is an important piece of health and safety legislation . #% We should have the courage to say that sometimes European legislation is necessary to provide fair rules of the game for the single market , to make sure that there is less regulation by having a single set of regulations for companies instead of fifteen sets of divergent national regulations for them to adapt to . #% Mr President , I think we see the ACP relationship as maturing well , which may sound like the description of a long-term mistress , but it is true that we know each other , we understand each other , sometimes we excite each other , sometimes we see each other 's blemishes , but we grow to value each other 's qualities . #% I also take issue with listing India , which is a democracy and subject to the rule of law , being in the same list as China and Zimbabwe . #% A cancer task force would ensure a cohesive and coordinated approach to all aspects of the disease , ensuring exchange of information and promotion of best practice . #% We must now reward that irreversible process . #% Mr President , we would like to thank Mrs Korhola for her work on this complex document . #% Would he say exactly the way he sees the furtherance of the work on the White Paper fitting in with that of the convention ? #% We found much to our surprise that when we arrived , she had been gagged by the Commission and was not allowed to give any information to either the assembled parliamentarians or the press present . #% Does the Commission agree that the immediate challenge is to ensure that the WTO lifts the restrictions on the export of cheap equivalents of patented drugs to countries which have decided to override a patent but do not have the necessary manufacturing capacity ? #% We must not now allow it to be punished for its own efficiency . #% Without the European Union , we would not be as advanced today as we are . #% How will the final cost of EUR 605 million be borne within the European budget ? #% Most of the children were not even born at the time of the incident . #% Mr President , the Commission 's attention was given to the use of depleted uranium in armour-piercing shells as long ago as 1993 . #% With reference to the IGC , as you know , under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC . #% I want to deal with some changes in the business environment and the way in which these policies of competition , SMEs , industry and the internal market need to work more closely together . #% In July I visited Belarus . #% Some of the amendments which have been retabled seem to be just plain wrong . #% They see unequal treatment of men and women , of people of different ages , of minorities , of people of different coloured skins , of races , of beliefs , of immigrants , even neighbours . #% 
Mr President , Commissioner , you will be aware that the Regional and Transport Committee has started its deliberations on social and economic cohesion via the second cohesion report and that this report launches the debate on how we face up to the challenges of regional funding and structural policy in an enlarged Europe . #% Since this is not a codecision matter , the best thing Parliament can do is to give an opinion as required and then leave matters to the Council to see if it can succeed where we have failed . #% Over the last five years there have been 40 actions taken against individuals found to be guilty of a total of 48 infringements . #% One of my colleagues afterwards said that point was a powerful intervention . #% Blocking the use of such sonars in any EU waters would deprive those who defend us of a useful early-warning tool that we might well need in a dangerous world . #% The by-word seems to be : if it moves , regulate it . #% We have proposed and recommend very strongly to you that in 18 months ' time this directive be reviewed . #% We have consistently said that if the error rate does not improve in the 1999 year , then we could not and should not pass these accounts . #% Instead , why do we not help to improve the economies of our European neighbours and of Third World countries by opening up free trade opportunities to them ? #% Why , for example , is the Irish presidency suddenly seeking in its latest proposals to remove Parliament 's power of codecision with respect to the Structural Funds ? #% That is why I will be recommending to my group to support a proposal that Mrs Lichtenberger , I believe , is going to make shortly . #% The Presidency must do something . #% A scoreboard tells people the score ; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible . #% The constitution is the Treaties which lay down the field of competence of the EU , the powers of the institutions , the legislative and the budgetary procedures . #% Sadly , in the former rapporteur 's report , she took a position which included all dangerous inherent radioactivity , went against reprocessing of radioactive material and recommended that the Euratom Treaty be withdrawn and the nuclear sector be covered by a chapter about energy in the Treaty . #% It is a flexible process . #% My words may fall on some deaf ears here but I would ask Members to consider giving their support to a couple of amendments I have tabled . #% Mr Pronk is absolutely right . #% Indeed , I would go as far to say that by insisting on call-back , which was not a phrase which appeared in Parliament 's second resolution on this subject after the Stockholm Council , we risk calling into question our bona fides in the lengthy negotiations which some of us have undertaken with Mr Bolkestein . #% When the SOLVIT system works it makes the internal market work . #% Small traditional butcher shops that sell beef unpackaged should be allowed to display information as an alternative to labelling each item . #% We are nurturing that by the combination of structural change and supplementary training , evaluation and the appointment system . #% I want to use the opportunity of the Commissioner ' s presence here today to propose - in the light of the exemptions we already have in the European Union for the audiovisual industries , which give us room for manoeuvre , which give us also the ability to evolve with the industry and to make a gesture in the direction of an even playing field vis-à-vis the US - that , in constructing the infrastructure for the negotiations , we should be flexible enough to accommodate our needs here in Europe . #% I also believe that the financial markets and the people of Europe will expect no less of this new Central Bank and that this Parliament should be relentless in the pursuit of an open and accountable European Central Bank for the near future . #% They do not feel that the European Parliament and national parliaments should reflect Europe 's diverse ethnic nature . #% So I was deeply disheartened to hear of this proposal for an observatory . #% We look forward to further enhanced cooperation by the Chinese authorities with regard to this matter . #% For our group , the commitment to circular migration is also important in Article 11 ( a ) . #% Another element creating unequal access to protection is that some Member States are just deporting people before they can be assessed and even , in effect , bribing third countries to stop them coming . #% Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas ; 80 % of its population live below the poverty line . #% That would be the first step on what may be a possible path to a solution . #% We also welcome the commitment to adequate interpretation . #% I am sure this House will support the European Union and the United Nations in whatever way is necessary to achieve lasting piece and reconciliation on this tragic but beautiful remote island . #% Mr , President , first of all I want to pay tribute to our three rapporteurs . #% Trade access is the key to development for our ACP partners , just as it is the acid test for Europe 's genuine commitment to put development first . #% So this evening I should just like to address what I believe is a crucial problem that needs to be looked at in the short term : the whole question of how we encourage the development of electronic commerce to use these tools , to address the sort of business issues that some colleagues are already trying to frustrate , in my view , by moving prematurely to the sort of rigid opt-in arrangement that they are talking about . #% A final point : as we have heard , next March Zimbabwe is due to hold a general election . #% Its recent Wildlife Bill , for example , will give greater protection to endangered species than ever before . #% But Mrs Morgan did raise intriguing questions about the questions which have been put down ; doubtlessly they will be pursued . #% Mr President , this issue should not even be a subject of urgent debate . #% But all Member States can learn from each other , and in particular they need to learn in the key areas covered by this report . #% The decision taken by the Lithuanian Government in relation to the closure of the Ignalina power station is an extremely brave one , as it is not in accordance with general public opinion in Lithuania , and illustrates just how determined the Lithuanians are to fulfil the EU entry requirements . #% They have their way and we have ours . #% The UN 's Darusman report , which is the immediate pretext for this debate , states clearly that in those final stages , the LTTE used the civilian population as human shields , intensified the forcible recruitment of civilians , including children , into its ranks , executed civilians who attempted to escape the conflict zone and deployed artillery in proximity to displaced civilians and civilian installations such as hospitals . #% Over the years the EU has been very good at creating free markets for goods and capital . #% Tobacco is the only agricultural product subsidized by the EU which kills its consumers when used as it is intended to be used . #% Given that the President-in-Office drew a line between his position in the British Government and that of representing the Council , could I invite him , as President-in-Office , to invite the appropriate Member State to start to make appropriate amendments to make sure that all citizens are democratically represented here in Parliament ? #% Our banks are extremely exposed and our dependence on trade make us extremely vulnerable to this sort of crisis in the world markets . #% We have a duty to the minority to talk it through and find a compromise , but we can not ignore the will of the majority either . #% Parliament should be involved in codecision on this issue , as it now is on matters relating to coordination of social security in general . #% Is it the understanding of the Commissioner that the UK and the Netherlands will now ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement ? #% We have to be ready . #% As regards the last-minute changes that were agreed only last week by the Council , we have also clarified that existing medium-term note programmes , a very important type of financing structure in the euro markets , can continue unchanged . #% For instance , when Commissioner Patten addressed the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets -- Mrs Schreyer sent her apologies , she was at another meeting at the same time -- he made it clear that EUR 200 million was , in the Commission 's opinion , the maximum that could be utilised , based on the assessment of needs . #% Yet at the same time those Member States are promoting participation in their national lotteries with billions of euros across Europe . #% They have imposed structural adjustment programmes in response to the third world debt crisis of the 1980s , which have actually had the effect of increasing unemployment and eroding social welfare provision for the poor . #% Particularly the idea that a move to the euro was merely an economic choice is , quite frankly , a lie . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Fourçans on what I see as an improved attempt at presenting the Commission 's annual economic report . #% We should not send one soldier from the European Union or from NATO to risk his life unless we , as politicians , have delivered a political settlement . #% The PSE Group urges the Commissioner to encourage more actions like this and encourage the Member States themselves to take on board their own responsibilities to encourage modal shift in a much more dramatic and radical way than we have seen in the past . #% He has been placed in an invidious position in running Thessaloniki . #% However , I am pleased that most of the issues have now been resolved for 2011 within the Committee on Budgets itself . #% Through TACIS , PHARE and INTERREG the EU is assisting the economic and political reform process in the former Soviet bloc . #% Please act on them . #% Our colleagues in the future Member States must be aware that this attempt to limit one of Parliament 's most fundamental rights is unacceptable , particularly at the moment when the European Convention is considering a further democratisation of European institutions . #% On average in category 5 , there is EUR 50 million underspent each year . #% 
I noted very carefully the words of the Commissioner in relation to Slovakia - and I speak as the second vice-president of the joint parliamentary committee . #% The powers of the European Union will be constrained by strengthened rules on limits to competence , on parliamentary scrutiny , on democratic accountability and the definition of citizens ' rights vis-à-vis the administration . #% I understand that we now have a legislative programme sent by e-mail , but Parliament has not been associated with this and it seems , as other speakers have said , that we had a legislative programme which was not implemented this year . #% In the meantime , President Bush has succeeded in brokering a quite frankly worrying US-India nuclear deal . #% The argument that they are belated seems to me misguided . #% In the light of limitations on the Union 's financial resources , we must examine more closely the quality of European Union expenditure . #% The Mauritius amendment is similar to ones we have tabled before on international agreements and it is to accuse them of not being commercial agreements at all . #% By their nature and by law , some of the offences that this proposal intends to cover are civil law matters , yet there is a noticeable absence of the use of Article 81 . #% Mr President , I rather liked the introduction from the Commissioner on this . #% But we believe that it is necessary to ensure that ethical public health and general safety concerns are respected and considered fully . #% Who is going to tell Mr Chirac or Mr de Villepin that they are wrong , they are not conforming to guidelines ? #% We accept the predominant role of the Council in this , but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail . #% The way to address the democratic deficit is to give people a chance to express their opinions . #% It is not part of public contract to require the bus manufacturers to do an environmental appraisal for Helsinki before they then submit the contract . #% But linking these two together - procedure and substance - I welcome the Commissioner 's support for a parliamentary body of some kind . #% I hope it will not disappoint . #% But how can we achieve that most effectively within the Nato context , and perhaps in a less costly way ? #% To my mind , this confirms the willingness of the Turkish authorities to engage with us in a positive and open manner . #% Mr President , the order and authority of this House depend on respect for the Chair and the decisions taken by the Chair . #% . Mr President , I thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her report and also for listening to the ideas that I put forward in the opinion from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . #% To answer Mr Hughes ' point , one of the reasons for maintaining the opt-out is that in the UK we do not have collective agreements . #% He has won many honours from countries and organisations around the world in recognition of his courage and vision , perhaps the greatest honour being his election as Poland 's President after Communism crumbled . #% Mr President , I just want to explain why I voted in favour of Amendment No 1 to the Gill report . #% I commend the Liberal proposals to Parliament . #% It was sad that , even so , this was a workshop full of professors and university researchers where the Tunisians chose to restrict attendance . #% In agreeing that national conciliation document , Hamas has demonstrated that it supports the formation of a government of national coalition , that it supports an independent Palestinian state , within the 1967 borders , and that it is taking the first steps towards recognising Israel . #% The judge has ruled , in a devastating judgement , that he was `` an active Holocaust denier , anti-Semitic and racist and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism '' . #% That is not his Finnish style . #% Independent polls give him around 55 % support . #% This aspect is not well understood . #% And only states legitimately have security policies and military capabilities . #% We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report should be implemented . #% The Pomerol is sadly lacking in information . #% I have to say with great respect that I do not think I can support Amendments Nos 1 or 2 which he has withdrawn . #% People see us as being protectionist . #% Mr President , in this legislation I detect a worrying and sinister extension of the scope of Community power . #% In small businesses , for example , workers are 50 % more likely to suffer from an accident at work . #% The comments from some US officials , including Mr Aldonas , that somehow protectionism is warranted to correct wider macroeconomic factors is potentially even worse . #% It is fairly obvious : the error rate did not improve ; EUR 4.5 billion lost , unaccounted for , mismanaged ; we do not give discharge . #% This resolution again recalls the situation in East Timor , where appalling crimes have been committed . #% while we strongly support a ban on the horrendous exploitation and abuse of children as child soldiers in countries such as Uganda and Sierra Leone we can not support a ban on the recruitment of soldiers under 18 in our own countries ; #% Secondly , the question of the disciplinary procedure . #% May I , once again , welcome the Minister back to this House . #% However , while supporting this resolution , let us recall previous statements in the Maastricht Treaty , in Horizon 2000 and then in Agenda 2000 , all of which included fine statements of goodwill on development policy . #% Yesterday , President Santer asked for a de-escalation of the British policy of non-cooperation with Europe . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for the way in which he has worked so cooperatively with the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs on this . #% I hope that both the Council and Commission will agree with Parliament on this , because in order to secure the long-term viability of the trans-European networks , it is imperative that we first ensure a commitment to act , as well as the sound management and financial probity of suitable projects . #% I believe that the Adriatic coastline there offers great opportunities . #% If , however , the waivers were agreed , would it really be compatible with the principles of the WTO for the European Union to accept the idea of withholding public support for investments in Cuba and discouraging companies from investing ? #% I think of the Israeli mother who would not let her small children travel on the same school bus in case they should all be lost . #% If you can not even get 32 signatures to support a position then it is not worth wasting the time of plenary voting on that position . #% Mr President , as I and many colleagues have argued for some time , the monetary union project is profoundly dangerous . #% The way forward is for both sides to get together around a table . #% My concern is that the money will not be spent in this way and that the increase in the ivory trade will stimulate poaching everywhere , with catastrophic results . #% There will be some dissension among the various political parties in this House but many people are concerned about what this is actually leading to . #% Firstly , I would like to thank Mr Liikanen and through him his colleague Mr Mingasson for the way in which we have moved to harmonize the regulations . #% Of course , analysts in the market are well able to read across from stress tests and other information and make an estimate as to what is going on in the banking books . #% It is a club that will take away your very rights to govern yourselves and , sadly , is increasingly beginning to resemble the very political system from which you have just escaped . #% Firstly , a commitment to sit down at the earliest opportunity with members of the committee to devise a new social action programme to cover the term of office of the new Commission , which will recognise the realities of the new world brought by the euro and the new possibilities arising from Amsterdam to promote employment and opportunity and to combat insecurity and exclusion . #% We can argue for financial stimulants . #% We do not want to see our development objectives and priorities subsumed by foreign policy strategies , interests and priorities . #% The role is complementary because national parliaments have a role in their national capitals in controlling , scrutinizing and monitoring the activities of the ministers who represent their country at Council meetings in Brussels . #% The other issue we should concentrate on are the many women 's health issues that have to be addressed and which are not given the time and energy that they should be . #% This is a scandalous state of affairs . #% He should be speaking on paragraph 5 , indent 2 , which is the wording in Polish of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum . #% Will we be watching every arbitrator and regulator to make sure that Community law is correctly applied ? #% 
Natura 2000 is a case in point . #% I appeal to you to have some respect , not just for the present environment that we live in , not just for public health , but for the old environment , the built environment , the one we are trying to preserve . #% I do not think you read the question - it said what action will be taken ? #% At Westminster , the Speaker 's job is to protect the rights of backbenchers . #% This instability may also now cause NATO to reconsider its own enlargement policy , Albania having joined the alliance less than two years ago . #% Anything else will be a travesty of justice . #% The other issue in this report is environmental . #% I ask the Commission and the Council to respond to Mrs Kinnock 's points about clear benchmarks for this transition process . #% I tabled a number of amendments , a lot of them with the PPE-DE Group , and some of my own . #% I should like to say to Commissioner Dimas that I really do believe that our proposals are supplementing due diligence : they are making it more effective , they are making it operational and there is no problem at all with WTO rules . #% Unlike Mrs McNally I see no harm in adopting measures that are in place in the United States . #% I speak not only on behalf of this report but also , I am sure , of other reports that need to go through the same system . #% However , he knows back home that the majority loathes this House and all it stands for and wants us to leave . #% Abolishing duty-free will not contribute to that one iota . #% One should recall the research from both Sweden and the Netherlands . #% The EU has for too long collapsed rural policy into agricultural policy . #% Like Mr Simpson , I speak for the north-west of England , where the nuclear industry is of huge significance - in Springfield , where the rods are manufactured , Sellafield , where they are changed back into something more useful , and Warrington , the headquarters of British Nuclear Fuels . #% Mr President , I start by congratulating Mr Garriga Polledo on the very comprehensive and technical report before us today . #% So I am afraid the fact that you drew attention to this concern has not allayed our fears and we will continue to insist that it is we , the elected Members of this House , who represent the interests of society at large and you should not set up groups meeting directly with the Commission , evolving policy and then handing it down to us to rubber-stamp . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur and Mrs Fontaine in particular for their hard work in concluding this difficult negotiation , and also my colleagues on the Conciliation Committee , who adopted a very pragmatic approach . #% The task now is to help the people to enjoy their freedom and to entrench it constitutionally and politically for future generations . #% If Robert Mugabe is metamorphosed into the coach of the Zimbabwean bobsleigh team , he should not be allowed to travel to Turin . #% MEPs are agreed , including , I am glad to say , Mr Gaubert for the PPE-DE Group , in demanding that action . #% I also urge the Commission to reconsider how more political support for the relatively stable , prosperous and democratic breakaway former British territory of Somaliland could help to tackle the threat of piracy in the region . #% Crime is important to our citizens and we need more Member States to actually ratify that . #% Eight amendments have been tabled to correct these errors . #% Let us not forget that there are hundreds of thousands of traditional barometers hanging on people 's walls all over Europe . #% I would like to advise the Commissioner that the Kangaroo Group working party on energy liberalisation is presently discussing the next steps we need to take in order to address the shortcomings not fully addressed in the current proposals . #% However it is important to clarify that the military wing of Hezbollah is already listed as a terrorist organisation by the United Kingdom , whereas the political wing is under constant review . #% That seems to be the problem . #% The customs union with Turkey shows that agreements with regimes which abuse their own citizens does not lead to improvements in human rights . #% That rule states that the Commission shall present its Annual Legislative Programme in October . #% We still have reservations about this Commission and we will be looking to call it to account in the future . #% I would like to support that and I hope that the Council , which , under the Finnish presidency , has professed to be as open , transparent and communicative as possible with the Parliament , takes up this suggestion . #% I strongly support the committee amendments and would only advocate a couple of fairly technical changes . #% However , what this tool was never intended for was to investigate and punish petty crimes such as the theft of a pig , stealing a chocolate bar or exceeding a bank overdraft limit . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Verde i Aldea for his studious and thorough work . #% Some Member States will want to send the same minister to each for various internal reasons . #% Without health you can not create wealth and without wealth you can not prevent and cure disease . #% Madam President , it should be said at this particular stage that it was the British Conservatives , the EPP , who asked for this item to be put on the agenda on Friday simply because , as Mr Watson has said , the Commission will only be ready on Friday morning . #% Perhaps the President-in-Office could comment on these remarks from the deputy chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland printed in The Irish Times . #% More relaxed arrangements apply to a whole range of occupations and activities and the reference periods are generous . #% This report is a package which has been agreed amongst the groups . #% I hope that we can continue to work in that manner . #% Today we wait for the outcome of the Lockerbie trial from a Scottish court in the Netherlands , but I understand it is the intention of the British to foster , in future , better diplomatic and other relations with , for example , Libya . #% The net result of this regulation will be , when we bring it in , that the vast majority of food in the supermarket will be exactly as it is now - unlabelled - because the vast majority of food may contain a small amount of GM , below the limit . #% Leaving the scourge of piracy unchecked will multiply the EU 's security concerns in the long term . #% This is a genuine risk given Macedonia 's domestic political fragility and its imminent elections . #% My report is therefore very optimistic . #% We accept this for the individual hunter consuming or passing on the game he has shot or caught . #% In the area of users ' rights it has been important to strike the right balance between a text that will be agreed centrally at European Union level and detailed work that should be done in the Member States . #% Also , while we are at it , why not have a geo-satellite positioning system so we always know exactly where we are on the roadmap and can better plan the journeys we want to take together by the most efficient and comfortable route ? #% That leads me to insist that the chief obstacle to Turkey ' s accession is not prejudice or discrimination . #% It is extremely helpful when he does so , because this is an issue where a number of us have constituents who are very anxious to find out what is going on , and it is extremely helpful if he can reply in English if at all possible . #% We also had the extraordinary situation , when we got to the codecision meeting , where four civil servants delivered speeches that really should have been made by ministers . #% For small shareholders , it will take more than the proposals in this document to protect their rights against those of large shareholders whose legal position can require them to seek maximum return within a short-term perspective . #% There are three reasons for that . #% I was responsible for drafting the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee , which concentrated on two aspects : the position of lawyers and the process regarding , in particular , the review under the second directive . #% Despite the presence in the seas off the Horn of Africa of the US-led Combined Task Force 151 and a NATO Maritime Group , it was decided to concoct yet another fleet and a further command chain . #% This is not just a question of funds , this is a specific practical area where the Commission has a key role to play and needs even more focus . #% He was arrested in October 1998 . #% It has been a triumph for euronationalism and that is exactly what it is : a form of nationalism that never takes ` no ' for an answer . #% When he put his hands down he saw that he was dead . #% Nothing new will come out . #% I would simply underline that there are those who will criticise the Commission when there is any doubt about our conforming as far as Union law is concerned . #% I do not think it is possible to have a statement of assurance unless the Member States sign up to their responsibilities under the budget for the funds that they pay , which amount to 75 or 80 % of the budget . #% 
It could and should have done a lot more to replace enormously powerful greenhouse gases with environmentally less harmful alternatives . #% A start would be a list of who is responsible for what in which budget lines of each committee . #% I can only admire the opportunistic hypocrisy of my Tory colleagues . #% I wish to reassure the President that , in my view , my first duty is to Parliament and to my constituents and I shall carry on doing that to the best of my ability . #% The single most visible demonstration of the EU 's usefulness to my London constituents that I have experienced came last summer . #% This represents some 100,000 people per year including their dependants coming into my country . #% Fourthly , non-governmental organizations with expertise in supporting women and combatting violence should have the opportunity to share ideas and exchange good practice . #% It was predictable that in the first year of the structural fund programmes rates of implementation would be very low . #% We in the Committee on Development and Cooperation , and the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly , would like reassurance that we can expect the same level of commitment from the new Commission as we have from the current Commission . #% The oceans cover some two thirds of the earth 's surface and European fleets cover most of that area at some point . #% I ask Commissioner Patten in closing the debate , first to assure us that the facility will be utilised in response to crises world-wide in support of the EU 's development goals and not just in Europe 's own backyard . #% I invite the honourable Member either to write directly to me on the subject - and I will certainly see it gets to the right quarters - or to take it up directly either in the committee of which he is a member or specifically with one of my fellow Commissioners . #% Mr President , I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 130 , 152 or 166 with regard to the delay which is being caused today by the debate . #% The recent murder of three members of the Calderón family and the serious wounding of another exemplify the uncivilized savagery which has become a familiar feature of life in Colombia today . #% Four hundred cases have so far been examined , all will be examined . #% Is there going to be an answer from this House ? #% We , as a committee , fully endorse the approach adopted by the Committee on Budgets in all areas but in particular would highlight their efforts to increase the payment appropriations under the structural funds . #% Finally , Commissioner , let me remind you that it was not you , not your predecessor but the predecessor of your predecessor who put in place anti-dumping legislation on fertiliser . #% However , the idea of striking a balance between them on a case-by-case basis whenever a name is mentioned misrepresents the nature both of dealing with openness in the public sector and the right to privacy . #% Also , to qualify for debt relief , each country has to complete a long and often contradictory ` HIPC ' process , and only 5 countries have so far managed to go through the hoops that they are being asked to go through . #% Naturally I value the work and the words of Mrs Pack and particularly the force and clarity with which she put a very convincing argument . #% Could I ask this august House whether our two Commissioners look like bullies ? #% This has never gone through any committee . #% However , I am informed -- and perhaps Mr Kallas could confirm this -- that five Member States have said that they will not comply with what has been agreed in the interinstitutional agreement . #% Amendment No 43 : people have talked already about the burden of proof . #% Looking at just those two simple items , success could still be within their grasp . #% These are three of the main issues which the round will have to deal with . #% However , we believe that now is the time to up the pace for change . #% With all due caution , it is legitimate to draw attention within each Member State to the fact that their national decision on ratification has implications for everyone else in Europe as well . #% We also have in Great Britain a Children 's Select Committee able to investigate child abuses and to interrogate expert witnesses . #% I wonder whether you could justify why you have decided to ignore the clock ? #% Now is not the time to ask for more money from Member States when the public perceives the EU budget as a ` black hole ' . #% Linked to that we have to ensure that if there is to be a pact for growth and stability , like Mr Caudron said , it must be a balanced pact containing elements for stability but , more important , elements for growth . #% It is unacceptable that the chickens we eat are effectively subject to torture for the whole of their brief lives . #% Are there any lessons for the CFP there ? #% Without one , we will find it much more difficult to do what the President of Parliament urged us to do yesterday : involve EU citizens in the creation of a Europe fit for its future . #% Until that happens there will be extremely low turn-outs at all future European elections . #% in writing . - I supported the Beer report on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , including Amendments 5 and 8 that called for Europe to become a nuclear weapons free zone , because I am in favour of nuclear disarmament . #% Even Trade Commissioner Mr De Gucht in the debate admits ' ... they do support a whole range of EU policy objectives including trade , and allow us to remain relevant as foreign policy actors ' . #% Therefore it is time to suspend this agreement , because of not only the human rights abuses associated with the settlements but also those associated with the new apartheid wall , which has nothing to do with security and everything to do with an illegal land grab . #% In other words , women are reverting to their traditional subordinate role of being the property of the male . #% Mr President , a letter was sent from Commissioner Patten to the President of Parliament yesterday asking Parliament to adopt , as quickly as possible , Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 in order to allow the budgetisation of the EUR 70 million for Afghanistan . #% I will never forget the representative for SmithKline Beecham sitting in our EU/ACP Joint Assembly in Brussels , banging the table and saying that they had lowered the prices of essential medicines . #% It is important that we do so , because what political parties offer is choice to the voter , different visions , different programmes , different ideas , different proposals . #% Why are they not included ? #% Finally , we have to accept that European and Member State regional funding is an intervention in the market and if we subscribe fully and completely to market principles , this gap will not be closed . #% We are glad to have support from many of the Liberal Democrats , as well as from other political groups . #% Mr President , I rise to request that you write to the Indian authorities again about the case of Ian Stillman , the British deaf charity worker who was imprisoned in India , convicted of drug smuggling . #% Still , even for those such as myself who were not able to follow every twist and turn , my group is certainly extremely pleased with the outcome and looks forward to supporting the rapporteur in the vote tomorrow . #% The Commissioner will probably recollect that with the previous voice telephony report , which was the first one to go into the post-Maastricht conciliation procedure , it was on the question of both the independence and the resources available to those regulatory authorities that the negotiations between Parliament and Council foundered . #% Finally , regarding the European Institute of Technology , I welcome the Commission 's determination to achieve its Lisbon goals and I admire its vision and initiative . #% However , Manica Hauptman , who took it over , has devoted a great deal of time and attention to addressing the very deep concerns and the details . #% The interesting point raised by Mrs Fraisse about the activity of SNCF permits me to underline a distinction that we still , unfortunately , have to draw about the legal nature , status and powers of the European institutions as employer organisations . #% Can you give the same guarantee in relation to the proposed tax on aircraft fuel , which was discussed in ECOFIN this week , and can you give the same guarantee in relation to corporation tax in the European Union ? #% The area around the back , including the bridges across to the lifts should be seen as part of the Chamber , and not accessible to the public . #% No , it is obvious for us insiders that it means equivalence with the Council . #% Could the Commissioner confirm that this will not be subject to any further delays for competition purposes or , if that disposal or sale is to be referred to him , that he will speed up the procedure as much as possible , so that the employees and that very important division with a long-term future are not affected by any more uncertainty ? #% Mr President , speaking as the coordinator for the Socialist Group , I want to address my remarks to three of the reports before us today . #% Appropriate product safety warnings and the licensing of suitable establishments would enable the usage of mercury to be controlled and monitored and people could continue to use their barometers , as they have for centuries , without a threat to the environment or to health . #% After the six months ' farce of the Belgian Presidency , it is nice to see an elected Prime Minister from a proper country . #% That is something the President might want to look at . #% I hope the Commission can give us assurances on this . #% Britain , may I remind you , is an island with over 100 commercial ports and the biggest , Southampton , is in my constituency . #% One of my fellow MEPs , Sir James Goldsmith , was in my constituency in the UK earlier this week putting forward various views about the fishing industry . #% But with emissions of greenhouse gases continuing to increase in most developed countries , we hope that this scheme can make a very significant difference . #% I appeal therefore to those moderate Members of the Conservative/Christian Democrat Group to join the majority in this Parliament in strengthening the guarantees in the asylum procedure , because investment in high quality initial decisions including such matters as assistance with interpretation , legal advice , proper interviews and reasonable time limits , is a good bargain . #% 
You proved from this work programme that you have learned nothing and that you simply do not get it . #% Having a consistent , pragmatic , secure system of recognition of signatures on electronic commerce is important . #% The European public fully accepts that security comes first and that their cherished freedoms , including privacy , will be curtailed in this fight . #% Madam President , the Committee on Budgets decided that it would be wise to draw up a report on this subject . #% Twenty years after you won back your ability to govern yourselves democratically , you are now part of a new political union that increasingly shows similarities with that old Soviet Union . #% It is excellent not only because it is good of itself but reflects what over recent years in the Committee on Budgets has become a seamless continuum of budgetary approach to our own Parliament . #% It is simply disgraceful that the system is not yet computerized . #% Sweden , as Mrs Paulsen has said , has led the way but there they have looked at , for example , heat treatment of feed rather than just looking at the blunt tool of slaughter of flocks . #% Cement is a major cause of eczema for all workers in occupations involving the regular use of cement . #% In addition to relying upon those casual professional relationships , I am sure that the Commission will want to ensure that there is continuity and access provided for those new incoming Member States not only in areas like those that he has mentioned - veterinary and plant health - but in many other areas where the smoothest possible integration of efforts is a matter of crucial and mutual importance . #% Mr President , I would like to make three remarks about the hearings , their results and the elements that still remain to be put in place between the incoming Commission and Parliament . #% The onus is now on Montenegro to meet the EU 's expectations . #% She said that Parliament ' s own audiovisual services had a negative perception of the quality and usefulness of the paid services provided by the observatory . #% However , as John Redwood said this morning on the programme , if Mr Blair is serious about reform and deregulation he will have had a team in place for months working out detailed plans . #% That will give a passport not just to 15 Member States but to 25 and a market of more than 400 million people . #% We remember seeing those Trabants and Wartburgs coming across East Berlin ; these types of two-stroke engines are dirtier but , in the case of chainsaws , there is no alternative . #% It seems to me that this directive is too important for that . #% Mr President , I thank the Commissioner . #% Earlier this week , despite restraint shown by troops , tension in Dili was heightened by reports of a shooting of a civilian elsewhere . #% Unfortunately , many Members have succumbed to the bullying of the Commission and therefore did not back the motion , which is to their shame . #% The second issue -- which he did not touch on -- was the ability of governments to try and include public interest and consumer protection issues to prevent gambling operators from setting up in their jurisdiction while , at the same time , actively promoting their own state lotteries and gambling businesses . #% At the time Batom 's whereabouts were unknown , but a released detainee has confirmed on Tuesday of this week that Batom is held in the Delta Rubber Plantation and , after suffering torture including daily beatings , is in deep fear of his life . #% They are permitted three telephone calls and one shower a week . #% I can promise you , and it gives me no pleasure , that I will speak in this House on every appropriate occasion until every woman and every health professional in Europe is aware of this disease , its symptoms , its effects and the treatment options . #% But we do not agree that it is acceptable for this House to take that as a reason to demand a bigger budget . #% Could the President-in-Office be more specific on the question of economic sanctions . #% Therefore , how will he police the new rules in this House ? #% The case of the Cairo 52 in Egypt is still unresolved after more than 18 months , and again more people have been arrested for alleged homosexuality . #% This is not about information , this is about propaganda . #% In this Parliament we surely are going to condemn that out of hand and condemn all those who support it . #% Mr President , I can assure the last speaker that we are neither lifeless nor anaemic in the work that we undertake in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly . #% When interviewed , a young man said he was not queuing up because he was impressed with Western democracy or the Western lifestyle , he was queuing up because he was hungry . #% But in an amendment that we tabled from the United Kingdom delegation , we are asking for a further , similar reduction . #% Otherwise , Islamic fundamentalists throughout the world will use this conflict to galvanise the Islamic world against the West , using it as a pretext to justify worldwide terrorist attacks . #% There is real concern about the final salary pension schemes of those workers . #% In conclusion , this is a worthwhile enhancement of the European Union 's information society capabilities in a very fast-evolving world . #% It is an amendment to the CAD I directive . #% Why do they not know ? #% Even more worrying , therefore , is the evidence of an Al-Qaida-Taliban resurgence in border areas with Pakistan , regrouping in camps on both sides of the border in alliance with local mujahedin . #% We must be absolutely clear on that . #% That is why we have decided to abstain on this report . #% Mr bin Laden has a London bank account . #% This is a very sensitive area of policy . #% Finally , the principles of partnership are at the heart of the Cotonou Agreement . #% He has rightly warned that this undermines NATO -- and it is NATO that has kept the peace in Europe since 1949 , not the European Union . #% We have to demand the highest standards of ourselves . #% In the interests of the solidarity of our group , I abstained . #% We are not taking this threat seriously enough and all Member States could do more . #% Only recently , several members of ETA were arrested on the basis of a joint operation between French and Spanish authorities . #% Mr President , I wish to support Commissioner Lamy on the far-sighted and important programme he is pursuing . #% I wonder if four questions could be transmitted to the Swedish Presidency . #% I certainly hope the Commission will consider bringing forward detailed proposals for a card for the over-60s in the foreseeable future , even given the difficulties . #% Can we not accept that the Lisbon Strategy has sunk , just like the Stability Pact has sunk , which is most unfortunate because that is what underpins the euro currency ? #% Three points - firstly , the whole issue of a level playing field . #% It is an international and inter-generational concept . #% To use government funding on one side of the debate would be an interference in this democratic process . #% But recently I was staggered when the Commission - just as Mrs Doyle has said - reported it had not finally decided on the precise terminology ! #% However , it is important to add that , in delivering the sort of benefits that Mr Miller was talking about , we need to reflect the fact that a lot of other improvements to the infrastructure associated with public transport will also be needed . #% This was a gross discourtesy to the Prime Minister of Finland , and I felt the discourtesy was exacerbated by the fact that the Member then proceeded to answer the phone and continue with the conversation . #% We must have legislation coming forward very urgently on that issue as well . #% We welcome the inclusion of the clause and would like it extended to sectoral trade agreements as well . #% However , the EU will benefit by distorting the marketplace in the minds of citizens . #% Will the Commissioner rename the sixth European industrial initiative simply the ` nuclear energy initiative ' ? #% This report criticises the fact that the clause does not exist in three big areas , namely agriculture , fisheries and textiles . #% Would they rather see the poorest people have no access to water ? #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the new post of President of Council , with which everyone seems to be fairly obsessed , is an appointment for two and a half years only and has very few defined powers . #% 
We applaud moves from direct aid to aid linked to environmental objectives , but we know very well that many environmental directives are not being complied with . #% Possibly we could have a vote on it now . #% God help us if the socialists had run Europe during the cold war . #% Furthermore , we would be gratified to see an end to the conflict by an honourable settlement . #% In these circumstances it is essential for the Union to develop a coherent , over-arching strategy which will better define its strategic priorities in the 21st century for the world outside , and that must begin with this budget . #% Let us not be over-prescriptive in directing how Member States get there . #% Liz has mentioned the trauma that people affected by needle-stick injuries face . #% Business awareness is a problem for the reasons I have outlined and its effects on economic performance . #% A decision has not yet been taken concerning the particular areas that will qualify for Objective 1 under the new tranche from the year 2000-2006 . #% Genocide now concerns the marsh Arabs : over half a million people destroyed in the last few years . #% Spinelli patiently built up a compromise that was supported in the end by 88 % of Parliament when it was adopted . #% This would mean deleting programmes if they no longer produce value for money and creating programmes that are more relevant to a changing global environment . #% Or would they ? #% One reason was that the resolution purported to give authority to the European Union and its functionaries to speak and act on behalf of Member States . #% I commend Mrs Roth-Behrendt for the attempt she made at a late hour to bring in compromises . #% The overall message that we are giving to the IGC is that this Parliament wants the IGC to be ambitious , to think long term and not short term and to address all the issues that need to be addressed if a Union of nearly 30 Member States is to be able to function effectively . #% But why not take advantage of that straight away ? #% It would also restrict the political and economic decisions of the United Kingdom and would dilute its influence and priorities . #% Madam President , I refer to Amendment No 49 on the McCarthy report . #% Indeed , local operators who have knowledge of local conditions are best placed to devise any necessary changes that local economies might need to make . #% I had in mind the arrest of Mr Zakayev , the Chechen representative . #% I recognise that the rapporteur has moved and I welcome that . #% We are still awaiting the return of that report to the Committee . #% I am not quite sure what was meant by helping to build a people 's Europe - that seemed to be a vogue phrase of a few years ago . #% The suggested European Indicator of Competence has its focus only on EU languages . #% When are we going to stop frisking free citizens at our frontiers ? #% I and my British Conservative colleagues have always been and remain strong supporters of the enlargement of the European Union . #% I regret , however , that the ECB does not follow the high standards of transparency , accountability and openness set by the Bank of England . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner how long it took him to decide to ban chicken from coming into the European Union ? #% Tonight , we stand with you and we will continue to do so until your demands are justly met . #% Mr President , I am delighted that we are having a debate on this vitally important subject . #% We must accept the consequences of our support for a comprehensive trade round . #% I can take the Commissioner to many farms in the UK where there are over 90 cattle being raised on an extensive-type regime and to smaller farms where cattle are intensively produced . #% The second point I would like to make is on the issue of governance . #% The question is , why is this being done ? #% Accordingly , I urge colleagues to support Amendments Nos 72 and 74 which should overcome this problem . #% I think that we have to be sure that what we do to the directive on this occasion is a positive and sensible thing and we do not , for example , try to table ego-amendments rather than eco-amendments . #% While I know that his name was among those raised in the dialogue , I think that one of the problems that we find in this House is in relation to the dialogue . #% Since I became a Member in 1989 we seem to have had endless institutional debate . #% I hope the Council is listening carefully to this . #% That is surely more hazardous than allowing them to continue production in carefully controlled and licensed circumstances . #% In my view , and in that of many in the maritime sector , the reluctance to accept the value of voyage data recorders and take positive measures to fit them in merchant vessels is a factor which makes safety in the maritime sector less satisfactory . #% Firstly , we should pause once the ten countries have come in and once we are completing the negotiations for Romania and Bulgaria . #% Let me stress that we , too , want to see greater cooperation in the quest to find solutions , and to have solidarity on immigration and in fighting corruption and exchanging information , but this should not necessarily be at the cost of national sovereignty , nor should it be overly prescriptive . #% If the delay was on the part of the Commission , we should ask why there was a delay . #% It will sour the political atmosphere and wound the democratic legitimacy of the Union . #% Mr President , I just am registering that I abstained on the Thorning-Schmidt report . #% They are expected to grow to more than EUR 7 000 billion by 2010 . #% Member States must keep all poultry farmers fully informed of contingency plans which , again , was not the case with foot-and-mouth disease . #% I hope you will take this in the spirit in which it is intended and reflect on different ways of achieving the objective that we share : maintaining security of supply for energy in Europe . #% That is why there was concern on the south coast of England and on the Isle of Wight when the French Minister for the Environment not only ordered the suspension of sailing and swimming in the vicinity of Cap de la Hague but subsequent to the July check ordered a close-down in the cleaning process . #% I thank you also for reminding us that this is an issue about diet , physical activity and health . #% In Turkey itself , as I have said , recent months have seen a decline in standards . #% This is the kind of loophole that allowed the previous Conservative government to exempt the privatised water companies . #% Lastly Russia must observe its binding OSCE/Council of Europe commitments to upholding human rights , democracy and the rule of law . #% So in the matter of this legal framework I would urge the Commission to think again , if thinking again is ever actually a possibility for a flawed institution in a flawed system of governing . #% So the no-fly zones are vital in avoiding humanitarian disaster . #% However ISAF , the International Security Assistance Force , still has its work cut out . #% When we are looking at public services in the developing world , we must also focus on the eradication of poverty as a top priority of our reform of public services and state enterprises . #% Mr President , I just wanted to protest at the decision of a majority of the Conference of Presidents not to send a delegation from the European Parliament to the first hearing of the trial of Leyla Zana , who is of course a Sakharov Prize laureate . #% Opinions can differ about whether the US and Israel did the right thing in staying away . #% I am glad to see that there are improvements mentioned about the Commission 's performance but the word ` improvement ' is not yet used often enough . #% This is a continued gross abuse of human rights and , as my own UK ambassador has said , in these troubled times the guerrillas and the paramilitaries are both terrorist groups and should be combated through all means as part of the current anti-terrorist programme . #% I would simply remark here that in trying to peg what is said in this report to previous pronouncements from the Commission , we are not trying to hold to a nebulous and rather nervous definition , but rather to seek an indication from Commissioner Bangemann and his colleagues of when a proper and acceptable definition of universal service will come forward . #% The more money the prisoner was able to offer , the more ear the surgeon permitted to remain intact . #% We must focus on the points that remain . #% 
. Thank you , Mr President ! #% Compare the EU to the IMF , to the World Bank , to the WTO or to any other international structure : none of them have or will have this degree of parliamentary input and of parliamentary scrutiny . #% During the course of it you said that if there were requests from national authorities for extensions , then you would be amenable to considering those requests . #% Therefore , if we ask for a code of conduct we will have to apply it ourselves in the future to retain credibility . #% But , in my own view , we need to look seriously at the methods we employ to keep fishing within the limits that are set by those TACs , to determine amongst other things , just how far there is an interconnection between the establishment of quotas and the problem of discards , particularly where mixed fisheries are concerned . #% That balance now is in many ways an uncertain one , because we are in such a volatile area of transition at the moment , not only with the explosion of digital content and digital distribution , and new forms of access to customers , but also with new creative works that are available for exploitation in the digital media world . #% Commissioner Mandelson , you said that we were to create a stage . #% This time there is none of the spiteful criticism that was directed at Mr Medina 's earlier report . #% In relation to the main issues , we do not need a prescriptive envelope . #% I would also like to say a very great thank you to Commissioner Špidla . #% The Council could say that is sufficient , but to get an average of 1 % over those years means we have to spend above 1 % in certain years . #% While that is a very desirable aim , we should not allow the best to become the enemy of the good . #% Why on earth are such high tariffs being put on shoes from China ? #% For us to succeed , we need to put aside our petty squabbles and the interinstitutional rivalries . #% The Committee on Budgetary Control is not trying at all to usurp the role of the Committee on Development and Cooperation . #% Mr President , I want to concentrate on the Commission proposals for raw tobacco and welcome those sections concerning diversification and withdrawal of quotas as growers move out of this sector . #% We pointed out that Mr Juncker was under the impression that he could revise in just six months arrangements that had taken five years to negotiate . #% It represents a single , simple , safe , harmonized regime that all sides of this House can support . #% We will be asking the social partners - who will play a key role in all this - to negotiate , in particular in economic sectors undergoing major structural change , agreements on work organization and flexible working arrangements . #% It is only justified under the general product safety directive if there is ` immediate and serious risk ' . #% The immediate need now is for the rapid deployment of a peacekeeping force and the delivery of humanitarian aid . #% I have two daughters , one five and one nine years old . #% Surely it can see that will probably happen if there is any more violence and it will just be isolated even further . #% There has to be a long-term plan but I would remind the Council that the stability pact was something Parliament called for two years ago . #% Let us see if we can improve them . #% I would like to ask the Commission what they intend to say in the ASEAN Conference next week in Jakarta , where they will be present . #% Mr President , may I congratulate Mr Purvis on his report on the future of the biotechnology industry . #% I certainly support her final tweaks of the text in the three amendments that she has put forward . #% It is not about stripping power from people , ignoring their views and giving it to a political class that believes it knows best . #% Mr Chichester 's amendment seeks to alter paragraph 25 , which was my original amendment in committee , calling upon Parliament in essence to carry out its own economic impact assessments . #% The key phrase here is ` pending legal personality for the Union ' . #% Yes , we could go there - we should be trying to go there , but I do not think we should be starting there . #% In the new economy we want to give those people the opportunities to start businesses themselves ; to go and work for the new growing businesses ; to have more control over their working lives ; to truly achieve their potential . #% Having said that , I accepted the wisdom of my wiser colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , to which I am only a very occasional visitor , who told me in the debate ahead of the second reading that this was a good package to settle with . #% But I do not want the Council to see it as a threat . #% The PPE-DE Group believes that if the Verts/ALE Group wants to play its role in a democratic and fair way it has to play the game . #% We must make sure for the credibility of this House that we do not fall into the same trap . #% We should also note that the chief inspector and the Commission made very clear to the industry committee that there were no safety implications at any of the Sellafield installations . #% I too very much hope that Mr Goebbels is going to withdraw Amendment No 4 . #% The Commission must therefore be much more ambitious as regards the limit values it has proposed and , indeed , the sea areas to be covered by such limit values . #% That is still some way off , given the enlargement fatigue that has now set in and the fear of some Member States of offending Russia . #% I therefore fully support the recommendation in the reports we are debating that this authority should report to both the Council and Parliament and should be available for questioning before the relevant committee , which would be the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs . #% Whilst accepting that good work is being carried out by the Daphne programme , the British Conservatives are opposed to the principles of the report , for the reasons outlined . #% Julius Nyrere , one of Africa ' s most famous teachers , in those post-independence , optimistic days , said education is not a way of escaping poverty , it is a way of fighting it . #% This report is a triumph for Parliament and I am delighted that we have come up with a compromise package . #% Mr President , this is an excellent report from an excellent rapporteur . #% This was just the most notorious of the many deportations which continued until 1951 . #% While these techniques will not solve our energy problems , they can make a small but significant contribution . #% I would ask the President-in-Office to assure us that the Council , bearing in mind what was agreed in a new article in the Treaty of Amsterdam on respect for animal welfare , will make clear that if minority groups expect that we should respect their religious rights - and , of course , we should - then the views of those who hold that deliberate cruelty to animals is morally offensive and unacceptable will also be respected . #% For example , the communication presents a good analysis of the changes being brought about by the increasing feminisation of society and the impact of an ageing population , but then proposes virtually nothing by way of action . #% I would appeal to the right of the Parliament , the Group of the European People 's Party , to join us in supporting the amendment but I look in vain for its presence here tonight and for its contribution to this debate . #% Safety issues simply can not be allowed to degenerate into shabby national politics at the will of any Member State . #% It is a reminder in each of our countries that excessive regulation , which may well have been intended to provide greater social protection , can often destroy what it wishes to promote . #% The first concerns the amounts necessary to meet the aspirations of everyone who wants to see a successful Europe in the future -- whether that ceiling should be 1 % of GNI , or 1.24 % , or somewhere in between -- and to remind everyone that today is the start of what will probably be a 12-month process . #% Mr President , we must not lose sight of the fact that we are not just debating Kosovo here , because , of course , Milosevic has been using these hostilities as an opportunity to tighten his grip at home and to withdraw freedoms from the Serbian people . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner . #% There is no room for the policies we have seen of late . #% I fear a great deal of disappointment lies ahead for them . #% A lot of those were going to Australia and New Zealand where the working practices were better . #% Therefore the solutions that we seek to the problems have to be realistic and acceptable to the people of Europe . #% Perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves that this treaty that gives this Commission these powers does not have democratic legitimacy in the European Union at all . #% My view - and my hope - is that prohibition will one day be replaced by government regulation ; but I do not say that this is a policy which should be imposed on every nation . #% This democratic accountability is vital , especially at a time when Member States are themselves making severe cuts to their national expenditures . #% Despite what the Commissioner said about the possibility of political progress between COPs , I should like to encourage the idea of a structural review of the whole process of the Conference of the Parties . #% We look to the Council of Health Ministers on 30 April . #% I also commend the work of the rapporteur , whose commitment reflects the strength of feeling within our committee to tackling this particular problem and a strong desire amongst parliamentarians of all parties to call a halt to this environmentally disastrous practice . #% 
As regards EPSO , that is Amendment 255 : it is replaced by an amendment to reduce the amounts in reserve to 25 % of the appropriations on the relevant budget lines . #% On many of the issues about former Yugoslavia we have led the Council and the Commission . #% I ask the Commissioner , how will modulation work ? #% We can only hope that the Manila peace plan can be made to work . #% I am voting in favour of this Commission , not because I agree with everything it stands for , but because it is the embodiment of the broad church of European governments . #% I recently visited Elevate , a women 's refuge in London , to talk to victims of domestic violence . #% Some action is desperately needed in that area . #% Finally , may I pay due thanks to the enormous and supportive work which I have been given not only by the secretariats , but by the tabling services . #% We now need to focus on how we can bring help to those people . #% We know that it is perfectly possible for the Commission to make many proposals , as it has done in the past , without making very much progress . #% More significantly , under Amendment No 1 , the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1 ( b ) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective . #% In terms of liability in the case of failure , consumers should be protected . #% Mr President , this is a question about the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol dealing with the reduction of CO2 emissions . #% The chief obstacle to Turkey ' s entry is its inability to meet the political criteria laid down at Copenhagen , especially regarding democracy , human rights and the rights of minorities , especially the Kurdish people . #% The Financial Times yesterday reported on the labour market problems in Germany , describing how reform is being resisted and vested interests are being protected , all under the guise of promoting social justice . #% I should like them to count how many times the word ` integration ' appears in the text . #% This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming . #% The technical work would thus be out of the way before we move on to the political work . #% For example , the number of children who suffer from thyroid cancer has increased fivefold . #% I am not one of those who automatically congratulates every rapporteur , especially , dare I say , if they come from the PSE Group , but on this occasion I am delighted to give my unqualified congratulation and support to this rapporteur for an excellent piece of work . #% It is a challenge which can and must be met in the forthcoming mid-term review . #% Far be it from me to defend the Commissioner - I am sure he will respond to these points . #% Firstly , we need to ensure that CCAMLR increases its powers of enforcement and observation . #% Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy . #% Lastly we can not support QMV in the CFSP . #% Because it is going to sound very lame . #% A merger between the ERG and the IRG is desirable . #% We can understand that in each Member State the same conditions apply and the same safeguards apply . #% There has never been a fatality in the transportation of nuclear materials and , if the industry has its way , there never will be . #% It is also alleged that Abdul Aziz , the cleric leading the Red Mosque militants , had family links to the ISI . #% We should avoid becoming obsessed with the question of subsidiarity . #% The whole point of the Laeken declaration in 2001 was that the EU needed to find ways of getting closer to its citizens and making the institutions more transparent and accountable . #% Mr President , I am sorry to interrupt this debate , but I am somewhat confused . #% If the honourable Member can provide references to justify the assertion made in her question the Commission will of course investigate the matter further despite the fact that , as the honourable Member knows , compensation arrangements are entirely within national law and procedures and consequently not a matter covered by the legal authority of the Commission . #% Easily visible signs and markings everywhere will also be characteristic of the building . #% First of all , may I also commend Mr Wuori for his wide-ranging report and Mr Cornillet for his boldness and his vision in trying to fashion a new procedure for the annual report on Fundamental Rights in the EU , linked to the Charter . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , it is a fairly typical morning in Euroland : everybody is busy slapping themselves on the back and saying what a fantastic success the last 50 years have been . #% There is a great deal of work to be done , it can be done and , indeed , it must be done . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for a comprehensive and wide-ranging answer . #% London 's air today is still very polluted and is amongst the worst of any city in Europe . #% Does he think it is an efficient way of dealing with this issue and can he forecast the Council 's likely attitude to it ? #% My last point is that on development risk we suffer from the fact that this is an emergency measure that we have brought in with great speed . #% As a consequence , it omits to highlight the need for active measures , including the judicious use of monetary policy to prompt recovery of business and consumer confidence . #% Mr President , we agreed that we would take the debate on Buitenweg , not that we would spend one hour on it . #% The advent of the euro will be a tremendous supply-side fillip to that market , and to tourism in particular . #% Our main education programme , Socrates , and the programmes of Youth and Culture have been mauled by the Council of Ministers . #% I did not support the call for an immediate suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement as I felt this move to be too punitive and selective at this juncture . #% My own constituency of Yorkshire and Humber has benefited immensely from the European structural funds . #% That needs to be asked if they are now at this stage expressing their concern . #% Mr President , the Commission and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs considered the question of the legal basis extremely carefully . #% What we are looking at here is extending the IDA successes in cross-border cooperation and communication between public administrations . #% I have no doubt that we will , in practice , be able to resolve these questions as we consider the legislation further . #% On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay , conditions , staff representation rights and so on , but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters . #% But there is also an issue about the reception and procedures directives and the quality of their implementation . #% British Government ministers and staff have been making constant efforts to draw the attention of the Burmese authorities to his plight , but with no success . #% We call on the Council and the Commission to show their readiness , in collaboration with the United States , to help facilitate the national reconciliation process in Burma . #% Millions of refugees . #% This report is important because it identifies the basic needs in the region and specifies in clear terms the policies which the European Union should now pursue . #% However , rather than criticise the Commission more than the rapporteur has already done , rather even than refer just to the four committees involved in this particular issue , I should like to highlight one issue the rapporteur also raised , which is that it is really entirely up to us , as Members of this House , to ensure that legislation is better in the first place . #% This will give Parliament not only power over the budget , but power over control of expenditure once it has been allocated to the separate agencies . #% I believe he will know that Parliament has gone on record against the Helms-Burton legislation on a number of occasions , once in a report which I introduced here . #% Given the serious nature of the questions hanging over the Energy Community Treaty , it would be deeply regrettable if Parliament were sidelined . #% Mr President , I should like to thank all those who have contributed . #% It is very appropriate that we are discussing this question to the Commission this morning , which is essentially to ask for an update on the progress in transposing the revised directive that my committee worked on back in 2004-2005 , and on how that is actually being implemented by the Member States . #% The main objectives which the Commission tried to attain in the implementation of its White Paper seemed laudable : developing employability and boosting knowledge potential . #% This morning Mr Poos gave an extensive report on the activities of the Luxembourg presidency . #% 
It is dear to our hearts that we uphold high welfare standards in animal transport , in particular in the acceding countries , where there is no tradition of high welfare standards for animals . #% Mr Barzanti told us that in his ten years here he has concentrated on European culture and protecting it . #% It is utterly hypocritical for parties that favour political repression in Europe to point the finger at states such as Cuba that share their repressive and anti-democratic opinions and activities . #% The same is true of the Green and Liberal Groups who to begin with also voted against the report being prepared . #% For example , in the area of my particular interest , employment and social affairs , I waited in vain for the Commission to act as a college and for Mr Prodi to highlight the way that certain social directives were hampering competitiveness and holding back employment . #% The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place . #% In Israel , the investigations into targets and tactics used during Operation Cast Lead have been carried out by army commanders or military police , severely compromising the independence of the findings , and from the Hamas side there is still a failure to address adequately the firing of rockets into southern Israel . #% One of the major banks in the Czech Republic - IPB - was forced into administration and this was done to the benefit of another bank - CSOB . #% We need to respond to that in terms of both research and the action resulting from that research . #% That is a reasonable remark . #% The second issue is transparency . #% The issue was last discussed in the Council by the Luxembourg Presidency , prior to the British Presidency , which British ministers would presumably have attended . #% We as a parliament for many years interpreted the situation to be such that if Parliament were to refuse discharge , then the Commission concerned , if it was still in office , should take the necessary consequences and resign - it should have to go . #% Of course each candidate country should be judged on its own progress towards accession , without any hidden political barriers and without having to follow the course of any other candidate country . #% Nine thousand troops are deployed there and the people are very badly repressed . #% I will ensure that we give very serious reflection to the specific ideas that have been put forward and I am sure that we can find ways to deepen our dialogue . #% But I can not accept that we continue to allow babies to have their throats cut while we sit around having ever more byzantine arguments about legal bases . #% It is urgent that those countries which aspire to join the European Union should be perfectly clear about the changing nature of the acquis communautaire and the regulations that they will have to follow . #% That promise was betrayed by Member States in failing to accept the Commission 's 2004 proposal for a reasonably wide framework decision on procedural rights , and now a piecemeal approach is the best we can get . #% To have extracted a commitment that the Commission will take particular care to set up a clearly identified structure , with sufficient staff to ensure application of the decision , is a major achievement of negotiation by all three institutions . #% The United Kingdom requested the Commission to submit an appropriate proposal in the light of that report and the United Kingdom made initial approaches to the Danish government to encourage their support for the initiative . #% Unlike Baroness Ludford , I welcome tomorrow 's state visit by President Bush to the United Kingdom , and his commitment to hand over power to a democratically elected Iraqi Government by the end of next year . #% To my mind , it is already a year late . #% On all levels it is something which we would welcome . #% Carriers should , of course , report the matter to the police or other appropriate authorities , who would then take the necessary steps . #% It used to be ad hoc , now it is really one of the core elements . #% We must re-energise economies , cut the cost of the state , cut superfluous regulations , complete the single market , and encourage innovation to revive the manufacturing sector in particular . #% I have been approached by many expats , all of whom did everything they could to establish a proper , legal and sustainable life in Spain . #% In London - my constituency - textbooks at a Saudi-funded school were found to contain hate-filled passages about Christians and Jews . #% We need to look at Objectives 5 ( a ) and 5 ( b ) . #% I congratulate Mr Schwab on bringing the implementation of these forward by a year , because they will be of major advantage in terms of safety . #% I feel sure the whole House would wish Lady Plumb a speedy recovery . #% Two thirds of the whole of the industrial sector maritime industry wiped out . #% What we believe in , firstly , is that the funds remaining from those ECSC reserves when the Treaty expires in 2002 should be put into such an agency because they are the Union 's own resources . #% A main objective was to restore or increase the budgets of the agencies on which we rely to carry out statutory and other tasks set by Parliament , namely those of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency , the European Environment Agency and the fledgling European Food Safety Authority . #% I remember well the problems caused in some languages by that definition . #% In this instance , the main burden will fall on police forces whose duties also extend to dealing with a wide range of criminal matters outside the scope of this regulation and the scope of Community law . #% It is time for the killing to stop . #% However , I do say to our colleagues , particularly our absent colleagues from this side of the House , that if we care about employment , as we do ; if we care about unemployment , as we do ; if we care about the social injustice that flows from unemployment , as we do ; then we must be prepared to make this area a priority . #% We must do everything we can to reduce the cost of that treatment and to make it available to all . #% Part of the issue is that people are seen primarily as economic individuals rather than as citizens who have the right to free movement . #% Whilst the EU is always very generous in terms of the aid we offer to those countries in need , our pockets are not bottomless . #% One point we have to stress is that we need to get over to the Council and , indeed , the wider community why this measure is so important . #% They also talk about convergence of content which I will discuss a little later . #% Mr President , before I thank Commissioner Mandelson and he falls off his chair at the thought of my thanking him , I should like to make a criticism of the way that Parliament was involved there . #% I want to ask Commissioner Papoutsis , who I guess is responding on behalf of the Commission , to answer a series of specific questions , and I hope he answers them very clearly . #% If so , may I call on you , Madam President , to ask the Council or Mr Solana to issue a statement making it absolutely clear that this was an exception and that the visa ban and the common position are still in place . #% We face the prospect of cancellation of the direct flights from London Gatwick to Strasbourg from next month by the Air France subsidiary Britair . #% However , the EU should continue to insist that it will support and engage with these now-independent countries such as Ukraine , and make sure that the door is left open to them in terms of Euro-Atlantic aspirations . #% Meeting the Copenhagen criteria is not a static process - it is a dynamic process . #% Despite the short timetable for the consideration of this matter , it has been dealt with very fully in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs and there has been every opportunity for amendments to be tabled . #% On the definition of family that EU citizens can take with them when they move , this must at least respect the law in the country of original residence . #% Commissioner , I am sure that Parliament wishes to strengthen your arm in terms of taking further action on the basis of the report which , under the Action Plan , was to be submitted by 2004 . #% The Commission must get tough in this respect , hence our suggestion of a service-level agreement with each clearing-house . #% Any imposition of these powers should be debated at national parliament level and then addressed in the context of EU cooperation on policing and crime-fighting , including guarantees for citizens ' rights . #% We need to change those percentages and increase that of those at the bottom . #% I was giving evidence recently to one of the subcommittees of the Convention , chaired by Mr Amato , on simplification . #% We try to get you to make political decisions , we put forward all our arguments and spend hours doing it ( we have a very nice lunch in the meantime ) and we get absolutely nowhere . #% I am chairman of the C.N. Group , which owns several newspapers . #% Let us have a new treaty . #% They may be guilty at most of a misdemeanour . #% There are some people in this House who seem to think that the requirements are somehow a pushover . #% The truth is that drugs can bring pleasure but also the truth is that they can damage health . #% However , we have yet to see if they command majority support . #% Mr President , like most of the other speakers here , I see absolutely no reason at all for any kind of immediate suspension , or urgent suspension , of the hushkit regulations . #% We are willing to cooperate with other Member States ' authorities , but we will not go down the path of harmonised maximum penalties . #% 
It will enable the bathing water directive to be better focused , with clearer and more demanding rules , and I underline that it is ambitious . #% That was in front of our Members very recently . #% I urge the Commissioner to bring that provision forward as a matter of urgency . #% On the other hand , European political parties simply do not exist in any coherent form except in the minds of enthusiastic integrationists . #% I accept that this a matter for Member States , but I ask the Commissioner whether there is there anything he or we can do about it . #% National programmes in this regard should be the primary means of countering this important social problem as national governments and parliaments and local agencies are best placed to have knowledge and understanding of the issues at stake . #% I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks . #% I should also like to apply some common sense to those two principles . #% Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently : the Paddington rail crash in London , the terrible rail crash in Norway , the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified . #% In conclusion , I believe that Libya 's suspension from the Human Rights Council creates a historic precedent for respect for human rights in the UN system , which , in these dark days , shines a light on the silver thread . #% Mr President , we are regularly reassured that the measures being put in place under the common European security and defence policy are intended to strengthen NATO . #% author . - Mr President , I think the importance of the question that we are addressing tonight is the fact that this committee continues to be extremely vigilant about issues related to the safety of toys , as indeed it does on the whole gamut of consumer goods . #% They have struck a right balance between both extremes and I would advocate - to use Mr Swoboda 's term - that `` third way '' should be applied to the railways in Europe . #% I have to say that until about 5.25 this afternoon I was also extremely angry with the Council because Parliament had been very critical - the delegation had been very critical not only of the Commission , but also of the Council for its failure to coordinate on the spot in Bosnia , for its insistence on lunatically complicated tendering arrangements . #% They see this as part of the natural process of adopting the acquis . #% It is an excellent amendment , which I hope will be supported by the House . #% One of the important things provided by this update , for the simplification and modernisation of the Regulation as a whole -- which we have already taken on board at first reading -- is the set of definitions relating to special non-contributory cash benefits . #% But remember this : if the airlines do not cancel or overbook , if they run the services they advertise on time and stick to their contract with the travelling public , then this proposal will not cost them one euro . #% The interesting issue is to look at why that fall has happened . #% If you think about it , the big difference at the moment between European and national elections is that , when we vote in national elections , we go out to vote for or against a government , not for a parliament in isolation . #% Madam President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Aparicio Sánchez for a well-written report on the protection of tourists . #% How embarrassing for the Tories that the FT reveals another instance of British red tape snagging investors financing small businesses . #% As the Managing Director of the IMF , Michel Camdessus , put it : ` At times one has the impression that markets do not differentiate properly the good players . ' #% We have to look to ourselves if we are really to take a major role in the developing foreign and security policy . #% None of us know how and in what ways that technology is going to develop . #% Protectionism was the fuel behind this short-sighted , sticking-plaster measure . #% Such an underlying budget balance would allow better between-years monitoring of the fiscal position , underpinning the discipline of the Stability and Growth Pact and reassuring the financial markets that the fiscal stance is not being eased , even if the nominal deficits are inevitably somewhat larger . #% It is a step forward that 44 new substances recognised as CMRs have been added to the list of banned substances and are going to be removed from products and other uses within the Union . #% Of course , there are still dissident elements within Turkey that pursue separatist ambitions or wish to reorient Turkey away from westernisation . #% Gordon Brown , MP , meanwhile , has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour ' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel . #% They would reduce Parliament to giving just an opinion on the financial perspectives and they would also place limits on the other aspects of our budgetary powers . #% A number of the national action plans were criticised for not taking on board the particular position of women , as Mrs Swiebel has been pointing out , in terms of social exclusion . #% You make reference to statements made by your colleague , the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom , Mr Clarke . #% Do you not agree , Mr President , that it would be better for the success of the European Union if we were to go back to presentation of the proposals of the legislative programme in October ? #% That means that a zinc coffin is required , at enormous expense . #% We think that by and large the amendments are sensible additions to the text . #% Would the Commission therefore undertake to look at the report that is due in the middle of this year from the international chocolate manufacturers , commend them on the work that they have been doing and encourage them to continue to develop their certification programme ? #% Mr President , I would like to draw attention to the complete disarray regarding free movement of citizens from the new Member States . #% It will be many more if there is any slippage in that timetable , because any country that has not signed its accession treaty by the beginning of 2004 , but comes in during the next Parliament , will have its MEPs added on top of the 732 . #% I would like to make two particular points which arise from this . #% There is a strong sense that we are all being driven too fast by narrow commercial interests , mainly concentrated in the United States . #% Frankly , your words about support for the UN Office would be a little better received if , during one of your press conferences in Colombia , you had not said that you believed that the Convivir could be steadied and that they could continue to exist on some terms . #% Fourthly , if the total votes recorded in the south were overwhelmingly for opposition candidates as alleged , how can the overall vote have been calculated as it was ? #% That was perhaps a mistake , because there is no need whatsoever to harmonise policies in this respect . #% As you will recall from our previous debates , this reform of the staff regulations brings in the major revisions and restructuring of the employment conditions and career development for staff throughout the European institutions . #% It is strange then , in my view , that until recently only one Member State used this opt-out : the others were managing just fine and would still be managing in their health-care sectors if not for the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments . #% It is absolutely pointless to exclude the European Parliament from that discussion . #% Multiply that by all the diseases and disorders , physical and mental , add the impact of ending the communist system in Eastern Europe and the two-way cross-border movement of health problems , from environmental pollution to sexual and drug-related diseases , and the economic impact of health problems is colossal . #% Up to now it has been done indirectly via the political groups in the European Parliament , henceforth it will be done directly according to clear criteria and clear procedures set out in this legislation . #% And very importantly , the vile racist and anti-Semitic ideas , media and actions of modern-day fascists and neoNazis in Europe need to be combated and suppressed by all necessary means . #% It may seem a long time ago since we saw the pictures of the burning pyres on the front pages of newspapers in all those Member States affected . #% The programme has much to offer . #% Every state will , of course , have to make a sacrifice following enlargement , but a minimum number will be guaranteed , with digressive proportionality thereafter . #% Bayern Munich is for it ; English clubs are against it , yet a UK Sports Minister , Richard Caborn , is here to lobby for the Germans . #% I very much welcome what the Commission has brought forward on HIV/AIDS , malaria and TB . #% Mr President , I am very pleased to add my support and my group ' s support to this report . #% I wonder if the Commissioner agrees with me on this ? #% I call on this House to reject the proposal in its entirety and send a simple message to the Commission : ` no ' means ` no ' in whatever language one speaks , except ` Euro-ese ' where it appears to mean exactly the opposite . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that my Group supports much of what is in Mr Turco 's report and is certainly wholeheartedly behind the general thrust of the report . #% Everywhere one looks in the energy-rich world we inhabit in Europe , and the USA in particular , one can see examples of energy extravagance , even profligacy . #% Otherwise - and I will end on this proposal : we must start cutting programmes if we do not have the proper staff resources available to run them , because ultimately we must make sure that these processes are accountable and we must make sure that we get value for money in the system . #% This Code is not published and , in any case , seems less than adequate . #% If they did so there would not be the big stick that might ultimately be needed in any negotiations with Iran . #% We know the inspectors have only been allowed in because of military pressure , we know that Saddam Hussein is making concessions in order to drag the process out until the summer when war is impossible . #% Bearing in mind that the euro is rapidly establishing itself as the world 's strongest currency and has now displaced the US dollar as the main denomination for world trade , accounting for 45 % of the global market compared to 37 % for the dollar , it is becoming increasingly clear that for the UK , staying out means missing out . #% Would you also ask the Nobel Institute to urge the military junta in Rangoon , Burma , to give Aung San Suu Kyi her freedom forthwith . #% 
We have a window of opportunity to enlarge . #% In these circumstances you , Commissioner , are now facing for the first time on the human front what you have faced three or four times in terms of animal diseases . #% So , Commissioner , I very much hope , although I do not expect an answer now , that you will look seriously at that request and that we will see you in Wales before too long . #% There was a genuine , technical error by the services . #% On the one hand , there is the pessimism of the most enthusiastic Europeans , who sometimes speak as if the European Union were in terminal crisis ; as if very little has been achieved over the last 50 years ; as if it is just a free-trade area and that we still need to build a political Europe , as if what we have is somehow not political . #% These amendments would significantly have extended the material scope of the Regulation : this should not be the role of miscellaneous amendments . #% First of all , Mr Virrankoski who has done a thorough job . #% This proposal will inevitably be bad news for cowboy operators , but as well as being bad news for them , it is going to be good news for all other road users , particularly the vast majority of lorry drivers , owners and operators who are conscientious about the quality , safety and environmental standards of their vehicles . #% I am not sure that he and I would agree on what that problem is . #% The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless . #% I can not therefore understand the statements from the Turkish Government . #% The new activity-based management system , that the President just mentioned , will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time . #% I would say to Mrs Dührkhop that we can always find ways of spending money on bureaucracies , jurors , and administrative procedures . #% Mr President , I speak as the PPE-DE Group spokesman on Islamic affairs and as a longstanding member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy . #% In the meantime , I hope that the EU , as the only entity with diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea , Japan , the US and with the DPRK , will help to initiate such a dialogue , if possible in concert with the other key actor in the region - China . #% I would argue that if you now speak to small and medium-sized businesses -- not just in Britain , but right across the European Union -- the trouble is that the legislation , the , the body of law , has gone too far already . #% Both of the Presidents have a crucial responsibility to the global economy over the next six months . #% It is time to listen to the scientists and not the scaremongers . #% I fear we have made progress in the direction of the Council of Ministers and in the direction of national governments , not in the direction of this House and the people we represent . #% The existence of this separate ESDP has undoubtedly been a factor in weakening the coherence of the NATO alliance , contributing to the recent very damaging disagreements . #% In particular , we are concerned that the proposals could allow a regressive government to cut its maternity provision so that the lowest paid working women could actually lose out over the period of their maternity leave . #% This report is negative as regards future enlargement , and in particular Turkey 's possible membership of the EU . #% Yet , as Eurobarometer studies show , Austria is the Member State where opposition to the Constitution is the highest , at around 80 % . #% This Parliament deals with laws ; the people who elected us - certainly in the United Kingdom - are waiting to see the law enforced and have been waiting since October . #% What is this idea that it is a stitch-up , that groups come together to reach a compromise that ill serves the civil liberties of ordinary men and women ? #% This brings me to the amendments . #% It is within our power to restore the marshes of Iraq . #% Mr President , I think most of our speakers would like Mr Mandelson to be here when they are speaking . #% Madam President , I should like to start where the rapporteur has left off . #% Or will we , as the United States suspects , not be willing to take the actions that will give reality to our ambitions ? #% Everyone here must condemn the perpetuation of indiscriminate attacks against the new sovereign government of Dr Allawi and the multinational peacekeeping forces and the barbaric kidnapping and murdering of hostages , solely on the basis of being non-Muslim , or cooperating in rebuilding the country , such as the Italian aid workers . #% The four freedoms are still unliberated and we are the losers for it . #% If you ask industry what economic conditions it needs in order to take on another worker , it will say that , firstly , it wants low interest rates so that it can borrow to invest . #% We face an identical problem with respect to maritime policy . #% I hope that fellow Europeans will see this as a contribution to the good governance of Europe that even British Members can support . #% This is why we can not support this measure . #% That has to be recognized and congratulations should go to those people who hitherto have found it difficult to talk to each other . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the report which has been a difficult one in terms of reaching a balance between the interests of what is clearly the very important - and very immediate - issue of fire safety and the more difficult , but more long-term problem of future harm to public health and the environment . #% In particular , I would draw Parliament 's attention to the case of Ron Arad , an Israeli air force officer who , in 1986 , was captured by a Shi'ite militia group in Lebanon . #% A lot has been done , but there is a lot to do . #% Finally , I would like to mention the amendment that I have moved with Mrs Jackson and a number of other Members right across the spectrum of Parliament . #% The European Union has already repeatedly called for the release of all Albanian Kosovar prisoners . #% I am afraid that there seems to be a misunderstanding of exactly what we are here for . #% Equally , this is not the time to permit cloned human embryos or hybrid human animal embryos to have their cells and tissues used for transplants . #% It is a very detailed dossier , a heavily lobbied dossier , as I know to my cost . #% Mr President , Mr Whitehead spoke of the Additives Survivors ' Network . #% Foot-and-mouth is certainly raging in the Member State I come from and in the region that I represent . #% In the interests of public health , public safety and the protection of endangered species , we will be supporting the demands for the EU to use both carrot and stick to encourage conservation of these endangered species in their indigenous habitats , to enable local communities to find alternative food sources and to prevent the illegal importation of bushmeat into the EU . #% The Union is at last facing up to challenges to security in Europe . #% They frankly require the assurance of our settled intentions concerning our future partnership with Turkey and I know that the presidency will do all that it can to achieve this great breakthrough that is in its grasp . #% Turning to Turkey , the EU is a secular group of institutions and therefore religion is no barrier to membership . #% Concerning big hydro and nuclear projects , it seems disappointing if we wanted the allowances for such projects excluded permanently from the scheme , but in reality Parliament has been able to ensure that the projects and the take-up within the European scheme are at least in line with Kyoto and the World Commission on Dams and the Marrakech Accords . #% They may find that their Islamist extremists are able to exploit the EU 's non-discrimination , equality and human rights legislation to their advantage . #% The only risk to safety we can see comes from an attempt to dilute the proposals in favour of the airline companies . #% These are the only mechanisms we can use to guarantee effectiveness and transparency in such difficult areas before future candidates join the Union . #% Firstly , Member States can simply decide to accelerate the timetable for reaching the 0.7 % GDP target and indeed go beyond it . #% I would like to contribute a few thoughts at this stage . #% Now it is just the political class of these new countries that want to join this new prison of nations , the European Union . #% The problem with your strategy is not that we are short of new ideas or new initiatives , but we are actually short of real delivery of the policies that are going to create the jobs and growth of which you are so fond . #% There is no way Albania can even begin to enact the reforms necessary to regain the EU 's confidence in the current political environment of instability . #% South Yorkshire has had the highest level of targeting -- ` Objective One ' . #% We are encouraged by the prospect of reform in the common agricultural and fisheries policies , but concerned this may result in more bureaucracy rather than a fair solution for our farmers and fishermen . #% British Conservatives are strong supporters of genuine human rights and , accordingly , have voted in overall support of the Wuori resolution . #% Only by improving the legal protection of accident victims can our citizens take full advantage of driving across the EU and make the most of freedom of movement . #% As Mrs Wallis knows only too well I have not agreed with a number of things that she has said during the time she has been rapporteur for this important report but I would like to put on record my appreciation for the very considerable work and effort she has put into what she has done for this Parliament . #% Paragraph 4 of the resolution tabled by four political groups makes it clear that Parliament is no longer prepared to continue with the piecemeal amendments and technical updates - of which my report is the latest and , we believe the last example . #% 
I have no problem with responsible gamblers participating in online gaming activity offered by responsible operators . #% The first is that , at Maastricht , the European Council , in its wisdom , instructed the Court of Auditors to produce this certificate of assurance - the DAS . #% But I have to say that I disagree and I think the majority of the Members of this Parliament will disagree when it is said that disability is not a high priority for development cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries . #% I would plead for the internal territorial interests of Member States to be overcome on this particular point . #% The charter primarily concerns the competences of the European Union and the powers of the Union authorities . #% Up to now we have had two categories of former Member : simple former Members and honorary Members . #% However , unfortunately , we are forced to do that by the constraints of the timetable . #% The necessary signatures were undertaken yesterday for us to proceed to the purchase of the Leopold building complex . #% Secondly , I want to highlight issues around the international framework , the repeal of the EU directives and their incorporation into national legislation . #% . Mr President , I wish to make three comments . #% We have to be sure that we are not being taken for a ride by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen , whose supporters have been largely responsible for the recent violence and political instability . #% Just as I do not think that it is useful to be theological about voluntary agreements or legislation , nor do I think that it is useful to be theological about a particular kind of test , but there are no different standards at the moment . #% I commend the report to you . #% In order to defeat terrorists , it is essential that government should be unambiguous in the message that it sends out and that public opinion should be kept resolute . #% We are not being totally honest with the European public because unemployment in the European Union has not been reduced by anywhere near that amount . #% We need to show the accession states that we can do better than that and help them to do the same . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I wish to express my concern that we have been prevented from debating the Brok amendment on implementation of the Members ' Statute . #% But the references in the report to targeting the democratic process and to the relationship between fundamentalism and terrorism go too near , we contend , to equating Islam and the Muslim peoples of this world with terrorism . #% I think the reform of the CAP in this regard has often been underestimated in the debate . #% When the MFA is withdrawn , some of the poorest countries will face major problems . #% It is all too apparent that we can not rely on the Sri Lankan government to give independent access to politicians or journalists to the war zones , nor for impartial evidence on what is really happening regarding human rights abuses and allegations of torture and similar practices by , or with the tacit approval of , the Sri Lankan government . #% For me , the 2 % increase is also a step in giving milk producers the option to produce more and thereby helping the transition to greater market orientation . #% Mr President , Belarus is the last surviving European bastion of neo-soviet ideology . #% Safety must be a priority and we all understand that if we are to have equal precautions throughout the Member States , we need a variety of measures in place which have not so far been instituted . #% Instead , tens of thousands fled as refugees . #% It has called for an end to that violence and for all elements of the global political agreement to be implemented . #% Policy reform will be given practical effect by its connection with the issues of the EU 's competences , the instruments , the powers and procedures . #% I therefore recognise the need for the research executive agencies ; but again , I express my anxiety at the proliferation of agencies which , I have to say , historically have not been renowned for their effective delivery of value for money . #% If so , the scene today is just as promising . #% I and the UK Independence Party , which I represent , do not want an EU foreign policy or an EU foreign minister - currently in the form of Baroness Ashton . #% Perhaps , more significantly , the USA reached current EU levels for per capita research and development investment in 1978 . #% In particular we must remember that Europe today is a multicultural society . #% The US would not waste valuable public resources detaining those who pose no security risk . #% Then , and only then , will our greenbelt land be given the protection and respect it deserves . #% There needs to be a great deal more caution than perhaps the rapporteur 's explanatory statement would suggest in introducing a change from national emergency numbers to the 112 number . #% In the past , certainly in the UK , it was a very common , cheap but delicious and healthy part of the diet of many less well-off families . #% What tools , what mechanisms , do we have to ensure that Member States actually deliver on the pledges the prime ministers will agree this Friday ? #% Yet I confess I voted against placing this issue on the agenda . #% We asked for special services to be taken out of the directive . #% In this respect I deplore the leader in Monday 's Times which in its habitual ignorance scorned the coming importance of the EB in effecting democratic accountability . #% He had absolutely nothing to do with that . #% It should be generally welcomed . #% Secondly , the obligation to inform is inherent in the Commission ' s responsibility to implement the Community budget . #% Because of this autonomy from the normal management framework of the Commission , the choice of director , I believe , is a crucially important one . #% I want to conclude by referring to the politics of the current situation going forward . #% Finally , it is advisable to offer individual consumers a means of redress , not only for blatant and serious breaches of provisions - as the Commission suggests - but also whenever direct and certain damage arising from unfair commercial behaviour has been established . #% Mr President , the Socialist Group welcomes the statement from the Commission . #% Commissioner , at the very least we need your assurance today that no money to benefit Iran is diverted from these countries , where human lives are just as much at risk . #% I would reiterate the points made by James Elles as regards the Kashmiri people being involved in this dialogue at the earliest possible convenience and as regards ensuring that the European Union continues to offer its services as an honest broker , as agreed under the common foreign and security policy - if , that is , both India and Pakistan feel it necessary to take advantage of that offer . #% We should be clear that it is Russia and France that armed him . #% The Cuban economy is bankrupt , not because of American sanctions , but because of communism . #% Opening your cheque book and asking how much is not my idea of negotiation . #% To offset that danger , the rapporteur and the Commission have agreed to a special committee , which will examine the confidentiality and security implications of the micro-chip . #% Her personal endeavour and commitment has made it a very enjoyable report to work on . #% By their big brother extension of powers for police and security services to monitor people 's email , Internet and telephone records they menace individual privacy . #% Everybody supports this matter . #% That is the result that we would all have liked . #% Not only must those 6 - and 12-mile limits be there , but they must be managed at a local level and properly devolved from Brussels , not just some token gesture . #% Now , as some sceptical voices brand EMU responsible for job losses , it is time to spit out some home truths from abroad about EMU . #% We should maintain the full list and I hope the PPE-DE Group will rethink its position and vote accordingly . #% I know that pushes the Commission further than in an ideal world it would like to go . #% In recent weeks the international community has called upon Hamas to change and now , as it gradually begins to do so , we should recognise that fact , give credit for that fact and alter our own political response accordingly . #% Mr President , during the vote one of my Dutch colleagues remarked that part of the report did not make sense in Dutch . #% Madam President , before my election as an MEP I was a postal worker and an elected lay local official of the postal workers union , the Communication Workers Union , with which I am still strongly connected . #% We see the scale of the problem when we understand that the writ of President Karzai does not extend far beyond Kabul and a few other towns , and his personal security remains largely in foreign hands . #% Why should , for example , freedom of religion be criticised in Laos , Vietnam and Pakistan , but not in Turkmenistan or Saudi Arabia ? #% 
In this case it would be much better if it did not go up in the first place . #% We will not give up pursuing this matter . #% So we consider it despicable that such crimes are also being committed by those sent to protect an already traumatised population . #% Ideas like allowing asylum applications to be lodged in the home region , and then to have protected entry or resettlement schemes , are useful to pursue , but these must be complementary to the individual right to seek asylum , not replace it . #% The numbers of such workers are increasing in those countries , but as far as I am aware they have no existing protection for temporary agency workers . #% The extra expenditure is not justified overall and these amendments go against the whole thrust of the CAP reforms agreed in Berlin . #% We should not try to harmonize things for the sake of harmonization . #% I had never heard of you ; nobody in Europe had ever heard of you . #% Some countries like Belgium have successfully removed batteries from the waste stream . #% We must also make it clear that the European Union has to change . #% We need to know what progress has been made on noise emissions , gaseous emissions , and indeed on fuel economy . #% British Conservatives acknowledge that the EU has made a significant contribution to peace among the nations of our Continent . #% For example , I have been told that I will be speaking just after an hour into the debate , so I guess the Buitenweg debate will take probably an hour and a half at least . #% We ourselves have to be careful , when we urge greater pluralism and respect for democratic norms around the world , that we do not undermine governments which , however imperfect , are moving in that direction . #% It is important , not just for social reasons , but for access to employment for disabled users . #% I am pleased to hear that the Commission will support that . #% However , quite recently we successfully negotiated a longer deadline in the context of the Lamfalussy report . #% The first is striking a proper balance between a quest for harmonisation and respect for the subsidiarity principle . #% Improved selection at the moment seems to be fairly random and we need some clear guidelines for the operation of the management teams and , of course , the implementation of recommendations which , at the moment , are too little and too late . #% In addition every effort is being made to carry out a selected cull among the dairy herds that have suffered from BSE . #% As Mr Bolkestein stated in his introduction , he does not have concerns about the role of the regulators ' committee . #% I would be grateful to know what response you made to the letter you received from President Mandela of South Africa in March on behalf of a number of organizations broadly representing a coalition whose aim is to kick polio out of Africa . #% My house has wooden windows and we have to paint those every three years , so there are risks even with wood , and of course some companies marketing alternative products will play up the risks . #% I am sorry that as rapporteur Mrs Klaß used her time as speaker to endorse amendments that she knew the committee had rejected . #% I would agree with that . #% What I should particularly like to know from the Commission is how an enforcement system will be successfully implemented for the public good . #% The issue of gender equality should be dealt with in the framework of the global approach to fundamental rights . #% No codecision that gets to that stage is ever entirely straightforward . #% It will undermine aid operations throughout the world and especially in Afghanistan . #% Would the Commissioner like to take this opportunity to condemn the ageism which is widespread throughout the European Union and is still a major problem ? #% As these amendments were not adopted we have abstained on this report . #% It has also unilaterally renounced its nuclear arsenal , as well as much of its conventional weaponry . #% We have specific concerns relating to the European Social Fund under the competitiveness objective . #% Mr President , I would like to thank you for your own chairmanship of this evening 's sitting , but also to say how lamentable it is that a subject of this importance should have been taken so late at night when neither the press nor the public will ever hear what was said . #% And why is the Agency expected to use two-thirds of its ten-year budget in only two years of the next decade ? #% I do not very often agree with Mr Rosado Fernandes in this House but I agree with him wholeheartedly that taste , flavour and nutritional value are the real benchmarks of food quality . #% We remember with pleasure those Ugandan members taking the seats specially reserved for them in the Ugandan Parliament for people with disabilities . #% Last Tuesday was a fairly typical day at the Gaza crossings . #% Mr President , I would like to counsel , if I may , Mr Solana and my very good friend Commissioner Patten to exercise caution in relation to the Middle East at this present time . #% So in legal , procedural and employment policy terms , the use of the panel system for promotion and appointment purposes was not required by the existing law in the case of appointments of that kind . #% They are mostly coming into the Union as refugees . #% The aim of the report is admirable and supports the principle of equal treatment for self-employed women and men workers and their spouses . #% Despite these concerns , where we have differences in Europe , most notably recently over Iraq , these concern how best to uphold the authority of the UN . #% They suffer from pains in the stomach , headaches , anaemia and gynaecological problems because they have no alternative but to drink from those wells . #% I understand from speaking to legal experts , however , that it is very difficult to codify that in an agreement . #% The Commission takes the view that the Canadian NAFO inspectors in question acted in breach of the NAFO scheme by taking away documents from the vessel without the permission of the master and by continuing to stay on board the vessel . #% This is not the night to rehearse arguments on the literal ills of smoking . #% If we do that , then we simply end up exporting animal welfare outside the European Union where we have no control over it . #% This point has already been picked up by Mrs Thyssen and Mr Radwan from two other committees . #% Some standard features of terrestrial banking , like applying the money-laundering provisions by looking your depositor in the eye to ask where her or his money came from , require fresh thought in an e-depositing world . #% So at least for Václav Klaus we thank you very much for the last six months . #% Nobody sensible would indulge in it . #% This means that we must look , for instance , at the structural funds and the way in which we monitor the amount of money that is spent on cultural activities . #% We also believe it is important that Turkey , as with all other candidate countries , must fulfil the Copenhagen criteria . #% We all have very different situations and , in their own ways , these are very difficult to monitor and manage . #% It is time to get away from the humdrum bulk-carrier idea ; something rather more visionary , I suspect , would be required at this stage . #% Because the dates are crucial . #% We need to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals and the country strategy papers are adequate in themselves and adequately followed . #% I would have thought that in a continent at war the least courtesy the presidency could have shown us would be to stay here until the end of the debate . #% It is not just a problem for the UK , it is a problem for Denmark , Sweden , the Netherlands and various other Member States . #% So this report will make no difference whatsoever to anything and the comments made by the committee and the Parliament will be ignored by the Commission . #% And more than this - and this is more prosaic , Madam President , it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive , that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require . #% I am confident that tomorrow Parliament will endorse it by an overwhelming majority . #% It may be that he has chosen not to answer , but maybe he forgot . #% We also welcome the fact that the gender dimension is now recognised in this report . #% Intercommunity relations will be devastated . #% 
On this occasion we are using it for two programmes , as has been said by speakers before me . #% Two years ago I looked at an internet-based travel agency , a travel website , for a ticket from London to San Francisco . #% Will he take steps to initiate a review and public consultation aimed at sweeping aside the backward-looking approach of the Council Secretariat and providing the public with a first-class source of honest , factual and accurate information ? #% SWIFT has been a valuable tool in achieving this . #% Last and not least is the question of successful implementation of the Commission reforms . #% During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands . #% He rightly talks about better regulation , but the priority must be less regulation and , crucially , that legislation must be subject to full impact assessment . #% We look forward to our first reading next month when the Council will get a pretty good idea of our opinion of its draft budget . #% in writing . - I welcome Parliament 's commitment to this cause . #% Together with the rest of the proposed changes in the Staff Regulations , we will submit a proposal to this House and the Council in spring of next year . #% Was qualified majority voting agreed for foreign and security policy , as the presidency proposed ? #% Rights and dignity must be the future of European mental health policy . #% I suggest that he did possibly feel compromised . #% There is a reason for this rebate existing , and it is as strong as it was in 1984 . #% I know that the Presidency shares my concern about animal welfare but I recognize its dilemma which is that it operates as the Council while the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties . #% With that abstention , we intend to indicate the following . #% We can be pleased that individual consumers can expect to return their waste appliances free of charge , and that the primary responsibility for collection and disposal of waste electrical and electronic goods will be with the producer . #% I ask the Israeli Government to end the solitary confinement and to arrange for an early release of this long-serving prisoner . #% They should have been , and an undertaking was given that they would be before a tender was awarded , but they were not consulted . #% Mr President , when I spoke on the Commission 's policy strategy at the end of last year , I commented on the fact that we had no sense whatsoever of priorities in that strategy . #% The Socialist Group condemns absolutely the hysteria which is being whipped up against Italy by sections of Turkish society over the Ocalan affair . #% Frankly , I think we should trust the viewers , and remember viewers are voters . #% That has meant a 15 % year-on-year increase in water rates and I do not think people will be prepared to pay a lot more for a much more demanding directive . #% Madam President , I thank the rapporteur . #% In concluding , it seems to me that we need a long-term European strategy to know what we want before we can shape a transatlantic strategy and think on similar terms with the Americans . #% The common position , as it has come back to us , is not a bad common position . #% I wholeheartedly welcome the Council and Commission statements on plans to be discussed at the Stockholm Summit on 23/24 March . #% We must ensure that more is done to secure research and innovation , giving as many people as possible access to the best in cancer prevention and treatment . #% Having said all that , representing I suspect a minority view on the Environment Committee , I greatly admire the work that the rapporteur has done . #% Puzzlingly , British courts seem shy of invoking this clause to block surrender . #% Clearly it would undermine the democratic legitimacy of the European Union if the ordinary voter began to get the impression that the people who most benefited from the freedom of movement in the single market are the murderers , the blackmailers , the criminals , the junkies , the paedophiles . #% The proposed Constitution has done us a great service : it has crystallised the threat . #% I wish to talk particularly about Mr van Velzen 's report and his ideas on carrier pre-selection . #% Every single political group at that time had a majority supporting it . #% The human rights of disabled people deserve the same level of protection as those of other disadvantaged or vulnerable people such as women , children and ethnic minorities . #% Too often in the past they have been told that changes in Europe are technical . #% I thank the honourable Member for his interest in this matter . #% Secondly , it should seek to reform the European social model . #% It would have been very helpful if we could have had the text in advance , but I understand and hope it will be available very quickly . #% At any rate , as part of a restructuring process , we would like to see those people employed in making trains for the United Kingdom market . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , the Commission and the presidency on producing a package of compromises . #% I would like to reflect many of my constituents ' worries about the European budget . #% If necessary -- heaven forbid that it should be necessary -- we can vote them out of office . #% It is going to be difficult though because , as I have said , it touches matters of public policy within our various countries . #% A United Nations force must be deployed as quickly as possible , with a stronger mandate than it has now , and it must be capable of protecting the vulnerable and traumatised people of Darfur who are currently under such terrible threat . #% However , the thrust of the report should remain clear : the challenges of an ageing population , with more people living much longer , with more older people who are inactive and need the support of others , and more older people who are active and need to support themselves , are not just problems for the elderly , but for society as a whole . #% However , those consular services are not available to Muslims from other EU Member States who would be there under the same terms and conditions operated by the Saudi authorities as UK Muslims . #% In the circumstances , therefore , there are a number of amendments tabled by a variety of Members in the United Kingdom which I would commend in this debate . #% I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika . #% That anniversary is a stark reminder of our commitment to the principle of ` never again ! ' , which was the founding principle of the European Union . #% Fears for the future trouble our societies , inequalities of all kinds have widened and some of our Member States are in desperate need of EU-wide solidarity and protection , having become the targets of ruthless and uncontrolled speculation . #% They simply do not understand that allowing countries the freedom to choose how much revenue to raise and how to raise it is a fundamental responsibility of our elected national governments . #% However , we do not accept one key conclusion about the single currency , where it is stated to be fact that the implementation of economic and monetary union creates a good climate for new jobs . #% In fact the whole project looks like madness . #% I have written to Mr Blair asking one very clear question . #% Mr President , we are used to having the Minutes in two parts . #% Or perhaps I should say fiddling while the Treaty of Rome burns . #% I fully accept compromise Amendment No 15 relating to transitional provisions to exempt existing brokers and also compromise Amendment No 7 for a regular review of registration as opposed to my original proposal for a three-yearly review . #% Allow me to try to cool matters down a little bit . #% It is good to get all the work through so rapidly , and I thank him for the way he did that . #% Too many people are living in fuel poverty , struggling to keep warm in houses that are not properly insulated . #% I have sat in this House now for three years through innumerable discussions on this issue and we seem to move no further forward . #% The guilty of Bosnia - and I mean all the guilty , not just the Serbs - must be arrested and brought to account , not just for the sake of the dead and the dispossessed , but also for the sake of the future of civilization . #% Are those of us who oppose universal standards correct in saying that river-basin management or local management of the groundwater directive would mean that you do not need universal standards ? #% The European economy is still in deep crisis , and only consistent action will change that situation . #% As a former Japanese civil servant , and as a member of the Japanese delegation for the last 15 years , I wish to put on our record , however , our concern for the victims of this accident in Japan . #% 
In yesterday 's Minutes , apparently , we approved a report on telematics in transport - which is all part of the transit system - going to the Committee on Transport and Tourism . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , we have been through these arguments on a number of occasions so I shall keep my argument as brief as possible . #% That is the idea behind the opinion of the Committee on Budgets . #% The Commissioner offers his sympathy , but we do not need sympathy . #% Mr President , it would seem logical just to vote on this amendment . #% Third , the whole issue of cabin safety needs to be addressed , particularly the number of emergency exits , the amount of cabin baggage -- try getting on the Air France flight today from Paris , for example ! -- and the use of sky marshals . #% It is a doctrine of internal security services that any population is only three days away from riots and civil unrest when the food supplies run out . #% He has also had to face the obfuscation and delays brought about by the Council . #% We are anxious to go through with it and we will be supporting the vast majority of the amendments and following the rapporteur tomorrow . #% Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation , and clearly that is a major concern . #% I am rather disappointed that the Minister was unable to tell us more . #% On the WEU : clearly , we still have to work on that relationship . #% The biggest disappointment is the failure to address the proliferation of nuclear weapons . #% Now , while it is for national parliaments themselves to determine their own agendas , I as a Member of the British second Chamber as well as a Member of this House feel that the formal structuring of the way that the European Parliament scrutinises what the Commission is doing may well be a very useful template for scrutiny by national parliaments and at the same time for disseminating accurate facts about what is going on at European level , to the benefit of all our citizens . #% The explanatory statement very clearly sets out the reasons for so doing . #% Are we prepared for this , I ask ? #% However , I abstained in the resolution , as a whole , against Cuba . #% We should not make this an obsession , but we must draw conclusions and look to the future . #% Certainly calling it a takeover directive is a misnomer and would probably be a breach of the United Kingdom 's Trades Descriptions Act . #% I share the Commissioner 's concern over the need for security of supply for oil and gas in Europe , but we might have different ideas as to how we can achieve it - in particular , not by interventionism in the markets . #% I look forward to similar schemes being introduced with other modes , particularly ferries and so-called high-speed ships . #% I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on his robust answers to Mrs Banotti and to Mr Truscott . #% This is in the particular context of the Commission . #% Certainly , building a multi-polar world with China and the EU as a counterweight to the US should play no part in this issue . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , this year , we celebrate 30 years since your country , Greece , became a member of the EU . #% Although there is work simultaneously in other Committees , we have to make certain that we can stand up to be counted , so that our view may prevail in these meetings and so that we can drive change . #% Madam President , it seems like only yesterday that the Commissioner and I were talking about other issues regarding the safety of some of these foodstuffs . #% Mr President , when we , in the PPE-DE Group , tabled Amendment No 4 we added the words : ' ... expects the legislative procedure to be concluded by the end of June 2003 at the latest ' . #% It is true that these two proposals are key building blocks in meeting that target and I want to say that the Socialist Members of this House will be supporting both these reports . #% Yet the drop of stock levels over past decades seems to be outside the normal range of variation . #% The European Parliament has pressed persistently throughout those years for changes to take place , and that possibility now exists . #% Specific tasks are already being assigned to it via other legislation . #% The EU could offer significant trade and aid benefits to Syria to bring it back to the negotiating table with Israel . #% We have seen already other pieces of legislation come before this House , for one of which I was the rapporteur , which were part of the jigsaw creating the total picture of control over genetically modified organisms . #% Since I joined the Parliament in 1999 , I have had the pleasure of working with Mr Rothley on this subject in which I have taken a particular interest . #% The British delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support . #% However , I hope that you were also glad that I was there for some of the time as rapporteur on the White Paper . #% President , I would just like to say to the Commissioner , if I may , that I liked his summing up much more than his statement at the beginning . #% Mr President , it is now two years since Parliament 's delegation visited Phnom Penh during a rare period of political stability in Cambodia . #% That should be our main focus in the next parliament . #% I fear that the Commission could not care less whether Euronews fails . #% We urgently need to find the means and the resources to fund it , to address the basic imbalance between the representation of the EU side , reflecting Parliament 's political make-up and spectrum of political views , and a system of representation of the ACP states based on one country , one vote , which prevents different political views being expressed . #% Those amendments apply also to the excellent reports by Professors Cabrol and Trakatellis respectively and I do not intend to duplicate the comments on the budgets hereafter . #% Madam President , like Mr Wiebenga , I am amazed that the Christian Democrat/Conservative Group thinks that euthanasia laws in Member States are an appropriate matter to raise at European level . #% However , I ask whether the Council agrees that the principle that it should legislate in public should logically be applied to all legislation and not just to codecision legislation ? #% Better labelling would have been sufficient to provide such protection as is needed , but perhaps that would not have been enough to satisfy the big drug companies , which are seeking to control a lucrative market . #% There should not be attempts to create a European armed police force behind the cloak of the common European security and defence policy . #% One simple example which I can give the House of the internal games which were played by the heads of cabinets - not the Commissioners - on one particular staffing matter goes to show how these things were handled . #% I think that remains at the heart of what you are discussing today . #% It will not necessarily make companies perform better or more profitably , and it will not necessarily cut out criminal or unethical behaviour , but it will set down a series of criteria for corporate behaviour that are likely to enhance transparency , accountability and systems of business conduct , which in turn give the wider world , shareholders , stakeholders and others an idea of what is going on . #% As you know , I am vice-chairman of the JPC with Slovenia . #% It remains a sovereign right of each Member State to determine how powers , including self-governance , should be devolved internally on an ethnic , religious , linguistic , or territorial basis . #% I would also ask the Member States involved to be more open to what other institutions , elected authorities and civil society can contribute , because , while this is about cooperation between Member States , it is not entirely intergovernmental . #% We have made enormous progress in CAP reform , but a lot more is needed . #% In particular I would appeal to Mr Ford to withdraw his Amendment No 1 even if I have sympathy with it since it would be a pity if a motion on these very important European and world conferences were derailed over Austria . #% You run out of noughts to get to the 0.1 decimal percentage point to work out how much goes on young people , 40 % of the population of Europe . #% Member States have an obligation to have it under the 2002 directive , but many of them do not . #% Madam President , can the Commission confirm that it has accepted Amendment No 1 by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy ? #% Some people are saying the projected underspend this year will pay for it . #% There was a misunderstanding here , I feel , because what we are talking about here ... #% The Commission should not fight shy of offending some of our governments that have sought refuge in plebiscites but are failing to show any signs of wanting to make an effort to win them . #% We want SMEs to really buy into e-commerce , into the new possibilities afforded to them by enhanced electronic communications . #% Is not the real problem of the implementation of the directive on occupational pension schemes that there is no political will for its implementation ? #% I am inclined to think , in view of the uncertainty , that it may well be worth sticking to the common position on that particular issue , because of the potential threat that it might pose to the mortgage bond market . #% Many of them face devastation as a result of increasing volumes of cheap Chinese exports . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , it gives me very great pleasure to be able to welcome the excellent reports from the three rapporteurs , and indeed to thank all the Members - not just those on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , but also those on the many other committees represented here , who have joined us in what has been a great enterprise . #% 
Finally , we do not accept the provision in Article 26 ( 2 ) which would prevent Member States from expelling permanent residents in exceptional circumstances . #% We know that there are serious problems Romania has to address . #% Mr President , I rise on a point of order as the chairman of the committee which is bringing this report to Parliament , and particularly on behalf of the rapporteur . #% Getting back to the matter at hand , Mrs Jackson has essentially asked all the right questions in the right order . #% Transporters will have to pay for very stringent checks carried out by Ministry-appointed vets . #% I checked with the Court of Auditors and they confirmed that the error rate was the same or marginally worse . #% From the point of view of a finance minister , there is surely no sense in reintroducing a tax break for the alcohol and tobacco industries : a tax break which curiously is available only to people travelling internationally , usually a group of people who are , on average , better off than the ordinary citizen . #% New investment of over EUR 400 million by the management of my local ports of Felixstowe and Harwich may be jeopardised if they have to open the services to other companies . #% But those six directives , when they became law in the United Kingdom , were extended to apply to the self-employed . #% However , I regret that we have not found priority in tonight 's resolution to incorporate two of my other amendments to support specific programmes for women , including reproductive rights , and to reassert our commitment to ILO Convention 169 and to combat the flagrant abuse of the rights of indigenous populations which continue to occur in nearly every country in the region . #% Let us hope that free and fair elections can be held with EU encouragement next May or November . #% I hope we continue in this way . #% As a result we have seen increasing interference in our educational establishments . #% However , this time I sense something more than an attempt to grab cheap tabloid headlines , something more ideologically driven . #% These reservations are expressed by the ACP themselves . #% On Mrs Fraga ' s report , although I welcome the general thrust of the report , there are a couple of problems . #% The report also wants it both ways . #% We must ensure that the Commission 's first annual report , which is foreseen for later this year , is on time and on schedule . #% I am proud of what we have done , I am proud of the collaboration and I now wait to hear from my co-rapporteurs . #% All of these efforts will not be assisted by the dangerous misinformation pedalled by the Roman Catholic Church with its pseudo-scientific pronouncements about the spermatozoa passing through the net formed by a condom . #% They fish mainly from my constituency and they are under very strict control . #% But I must say to the Commissioner that such a policy should not just apply to us ; it should apply to everyone in authority and especially to those in public service . #% Like others , I also believe that this is an initiative which is wrong in pragmatic terms , being part of a piecemeal approach to creating a common immigration policy , which we have seen far too much of in this House already . #% At that time the Socialists were the largest group ; happily that state of affairs no longer applies and hopefully will continue to no longer apply long into the future . #% On my last visit to Beijing , all the people with whom I had contact were subsequently arrested , imprisoned and , in some cases , tortured . #% We have waited five years ; we have waited 1,825 days since this measure should have been brought in . #% Clearly , Israeli intelligence underestimated Hizbollah 's training and equipment , in particular high-tech Russian anti-tank and anti-ship weapons . #% We must ensure that we are working on the basis of scientific fact and that is why it is not appropriate to call for a moratorium at the moment , when there is no scientific link between the two . #% But we should also reward good practice by reducing the number of inspections where leakage is not occurring , as well as stepping up the number of inspections where we have leaks . #% In this oral question and in this debate we are not talking about prostitution where the prostitutes know what they are doing . #% That is why clear and decisive prioritisation of future programmes will be essential , matched by a clear and certain simplified budgetary procedure . #% Others have been disappointed with the Treaty of Nice , because it did not go far enough and because of some of the questionable compromises it contains , such as the voting system in the Council and the extra seats in the European Parliament . #% But people who have MS clearly must be encouraged to play a full part in the community and such discrimination as exists within the community can not be allowed to stand . #% This is a highly dangerous way of proceeding and , after giving them nine months to consider the matter , it is now high time to put these reports on Parliament 's agenda , if not today , then later in the week . #% Mr President , on this very day the Phillips inquiry into BSE and its relation with CJD opens in London , in my country . #% The EU is increasingly in danger of being left out . #% It was not done with EU schemes : this all began before the UK joined the then EC . #% I simply want to say to the rapporteur that the way in which he did this job , both on the temporary committee and subsequently , is a template for the way in which this work should be done . #% I could not disagree more with Mrs Guinebertière . #% I note that if Amendments Nos 100 and 101 were both to be adopted , it would come to exactly the same text as this compromise amendment , except for the problematic word `` more '' . #% Over the past several years , they have begun to integrate themselves into the global economic community . #% In response to a specific issue raised by the honourable Member 's question , I have to point out that the produce of new plantings would not give entitlement to aid . #% Circumstances and conditions in those countries that will shortly be members of the European Union will dictate that we take a different approach to some of the legislation . #% In order to create those rules it needs an institutional framework . #% Clearly we need closer cooperation , although that cooperation has to be within an international framework . #% It was agreed that high standards of animal welfare and husbandry are essential to eliminate any need for such prophylactic use of antibiotics . #% I trust , therefore , that the European Council this week will confirm its commitment to the accession date of 1 January 2007 for those countries . #% That is what we said was necessary when we debated distance-selling in this House a year ago . #% Our Deputy Foreign Minister praised the shared values of the UK and Saudi Arabia . #% In the meantime Morocco has continued its repression , including the recent alarming allegations of arbitrary arrests , ill treatment of prisoners in custody and even allegations of torture . #% The original draft was a little too open-ended . #% Madam President , I very much welcome the report and thank Mr Blokland for the work he has done . #% It is quite wrong that the Commission Decision of 18 May 2000 , which defines the composition of standing committees , specifically exempts consumer groups from representation on these committees . #% Importantly , the principle of subsidiarity has been promoted in terms of defining the port-related areas to which the directive will apply . #% I hope that ` Harry Pottering ' will sort out his Group -- wave his magic wand , perhaps -- and ask those Members who apparently want to belong to his very federalist group in the European Parliament to draw the consequences of that . #% Nobody in my Group supports the ideology or the practice of the Vlaams Blok , but in a democracy that is not the point . #% That is the scene confronting us . #% Perhaps we should have been more worried about the bizarre comments by the President of the Commission and tabled an amendment about that . #% The idea that politicians in Brussels or Strasbourg should determine how many hours different people work across Europe is , we believe , fundamentally daft . #% There is a vast grey economy and there is high unemployment , features not entirely unknown in some of the countries that are already European Union Member States . #% The promise of a Green Paper in the middle of this year is not an adequate response to the anguish that those workers , their families and entire communities have felt . #% I am very grateful to the Commissioner and the Commission for accepting those amendments too . #% It is only a small step in the peace and rebuilding programme . #% I would hope that the actions by the United States in pursuit of `` pork barrel '' politics , because of the elections in November , are not going to encourage those Members of the EU who are opposed to further reform . #% He must make sure that from now on that a central objective is to help the internal market to move forward . #% Forgive me for being passionate about this , but if you can stop accidents in the workplace , I say you are doing a favour for the workers in the enterprise and for the businesses themselves . #% 
It is perhaps inevitable as we are discussing the ending of the Portuguese Presidency that , with the recent speeches in Berlin , the memory is going to focus more on the second half of the IGC than the first , but I would like at this stage to record my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency for their assiduousness in consulting the Parliament both here in the plenary and in the Constitutional Affairs Committee . #% So let us have some joined-up thinking here in the European Parliament . #% On the issue of Bulgaria and Romania we need a target date , a focus . #% Madam President , I refer to page 8 of the Minutes for yesterday where it says : ' The President closed the debate ' . #% For this reason , the revival of the inter-services consultation group is particularly welcome . #% One aspect will be that we ensure proper trials for those guilty of genocide . #% Mr President , there are two aspects to this issue : firstly , the problem of excluding unwanted migrants from the European Union - or at least controlling their access ; and , secondly , the reasons for migration . #% Mr President , I would like to point out that on page 11 of the Minutes , there is a reference to my opposition to the urgency that came through yesterday . #% Why have they had the need ? #% The profession needs to be independent , but its protectionism should only serve the public interest . #% A thousand , very sadly , die each year , with the consequent effects on administration , the burden to businesses of finding replacements , of training , finding the costs for compensating the relatives . #% There are two other important issues which I want to bring to the attention of the Commission . #% We welcome the assumption of access and hope it proves just that . #% I can understand the relief of delegates there of it not being a defeat , but it was hardly a triumph . #% That is the way to involve national parliaments , not by creating some new institution which would duplicate the Council , some sort of third chamber . #% This is the opening gambit and not the end game . #% The essentially corrupt and uncontrolled system is the problem . #% He also addressed the question of non-EU NATO members . #% My Czech colleagues tell me that this has been very good for the quails , but disastrous for the human beings who live and work there ! #% This situation can only worsen with an increase in the violent storms caused by global warming . #% This UN Conference therefore has to be about a new deal for LDCs ; one that promotes pro-poor economic growth , poverty reduction and sustainable development . #% Batteries have made a contribution to safety . #% Mr President , it may be worthwhile just to reflect for one moment on why it was thought necessary to introduce legislation to make compensation a legal right for those air passengers who face cancellation and delay through no fault of their own . #% Only by getting people back to work , getting people to pay taxes , reducing social security spending as a whole , will we actually get to meet those debt and deficit criteria and see jobs and the single currency at the same time . #% But it is interesting to note that that case was actually launched thirteen years ago and relates to a directive which dates back even further . #% We were challenged by the Commission and by the Council to get this directive through as quickly as possible . #% Perhaps today , most of all , we should listen to the local man who told me that to speak out for the community , for the environment or for human rights is suicide . #% However , what we are getting is a process of salami slicing , where each new proposal removes a little more protection against invasions of privacy . #% I hope all colleagues will support me in saying we should seriously get a grip on how business in this chamber is run . #% This building is full of dead spaces and blank walls which are extremely tedious and unfriendly and inhuman . #% As the rapporteur says : ' social protection systems help to establish social consensus which is an important precondition for sustainable economic development ' . #% 2004 offers us opportunities to improve what our President of the Council refers to as the existing European constitution , the Treaties . #% Therefore , Commissioner , we really would like a statement of intent on whether the four-year transition period is achievable . #% Mr President , a very important event in EU-Turkey relations is occurring at this very moment . #% Some of us have reservations , perhaps , about the extension of these provisions , as they stand , to products of plant origin . #% My colleague , Mrs Guy-Quint , is going to cover all the detailed budgetary questions with her considerable expertise in that subject , but I would just like to mention two final elements of our questions , to set them in context . #% Nevertheless , the 27 governments in Council concluded , perhaps surprisingly , that Bulgaria fulfilled the conditions for Schengen , a system which is itself under question at the moment . #% May I suggest , if you really want tax harmonisation , that the Commission and the bureaucracy pay the same taxes as the electorate , that they bear the same burden of tax as the rest of us , before the electorate storm this building and hang us from the rafters , as they have every right to do . #% Mr President , I would like to refer to my question which is now number 52 on the question paper , which I tabled within due time specifically addressed to Mr. Liikanen , on the subject of regulatory impact assessment . #% But we have to look at the root causes of terrorism . #% It is vital in our view for strategic industrial reasons , strategic employment reasons and to ensure and enhance the competitiveness of the European Union . #% As a former lecturer myself , I would have welcomed a clear idea of how British teaching and educational standards compared to those of other European countries . #% I am glad that Mr Olsson accepts that there is an equality of effectiveness between the way the UK takes out animals at 30 months and the slaughter of affected herds and testing of individual animals before they enter the food chain in other European countries . #% One particular success is on the issue of the budget line associated with the approval of orphan drugs by the medicines agency . #% In other words , there is considerable sympathy in Parliament for much of what the Commission intends to achieve in its White Paper but genuine concern about what might be the real effects of some of the proposals therein . #% I am sad to say that we understand only too well that the scourge of drug addiction is big business too . #% The EPLP believes that the EU must look at all methods of attracting investment and is not convinced that a harmonised tax base will attract further foreign investment . #% Finally , specifically on corporate social responsibility , I welcome the Commission 's new commitment to promote and enact the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprise in its White Paper this week and I repeat - as we do in paragraph 15 - the ultimate aim is a binding EU code of conduct for multinational enterprise . #% On the other aspects , there are many positive areas in the CFSP : the Petersberg tasks , the new arrangements for the Troika , the policy and planning unit - all provide us with an opportunity for greater coherence . #% I am not seeking to hold up the Nassauer report but I would ask for the matter to be referred , in future cases , to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs because this is a very important precedent . #% They are everything to do with the rapporteur jumping to conclusions that are not supported by specific scientific evidence . #% The gracious and enthusiastic way she has produced this report has made it very interesting . #% We should always remember that in the modern circumstances criminality does not stand still either . #% When you discard it , you discard your civilised rights . #% Usually , these have been armed rebel groups in developing countries which are supplied by non-Western countries . #% The Commission has a crucial role in this . #% At times it has not been easy . #% Postponing the argument achieves nothing whatsoever . #% Unless that happens I warn the Council that whether it be the Italian presidency winding up to their presidency in July or Mr Spring or Mr Bruton presenting the programme of the Irish presidency , this Parliament will roundly reject the conclusions of Florence , unless the Council gives a real commitment to bringing unemployment down , getting growth back to Europe and ensuring that the EMU project can continue on a path that will mean something to the citizens rather than simply being something which is pursued by central bankers . #% Important though these aspects are , the prime reason why the citizens of Europe will recommend the Murphy report is the emphasis it rightly places on safety and accessibility for everyone . #% However , I equally reject the concept of a fortress Europe . #% Mr President , I do not feel that I will need the full five minutes , hopefully this will allow you to speed up proceedings tonight . #% There are 26 major water projects under way in the Islamic Republic of Iran to try and provide the local population with water . #% I do not know the quid pro quo envisaged by the British Government to tempt the Balkan countries into having these refugee camps , but I would like to suggest one topic that requires active and early consideration with the Balkan countries and that is a review of visa policies . #% What we now know is that if you have a new-born hearing screening programme , you can give new hope to those children , real potential for them and my plea is that the Commissioner finds a slot within the seventh programme to develop that knowledge further . #% The Commission should not be attempting to make it . #% 
The thought , the idea or the concept that United Kingdom energy could possibly be controlled by some sort of arrangement with a gangster like Putin is absolutely ludicrous ! #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the Commission is quite correct to say that the service ought to combine all the instruments and assets that are required for the conduct of an active foreign policy across the globe . #% His office is the smallest ombudsman 's office of any in Europe , save Malta . #% Madam President , in the context of agriculture and the environmental impact in different terrain , I have to say that all the arguments put by Mr Santini apply equally to less-favoured areas . #% What can he do to reinforce it ? #% We know the Commission is discussing them . #% The House should throw it out . #% Mr President , I see from my order paper that the vote on the situation in Iraq has been withdrawn . #% We do not need a directive to do that . #% Mr President , the bombings at the Gateway of India and the Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai on 25 August 2003 killed and injured scores of innocent civilians . #% Trade in its parts must be curtailed . #% We need to be aware of the implications for the whole operation of the European Union of the fact that Schengen will contain two non-EU Member States when Icelandic and Norwegian participation is confirmed . #% We should throw ourselves behind the process of regime change which is taking place in Turkey . #% The results show clearly that trained cabin crew make the difference . #% That is why our resolution requests from the Council and the Commission that plans be made that go beyond the PCA formulation towards a free trade and visa-free travel area , particularly if Ukraine can shortly join the WTO . #% If we could move forward on those two points , I feel both the accountability and legitimacy of the European Union ' s negotiating position in the Millennium Round will have been significantly strengthened . #% The content and organisation of national education systems is an area in which the EU , in theory , has no jurisdiction , and this report highlights why . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for her hard work and willingness to reach an agreement , difficult though that path has been and will be . #% Eight thousand British jobs are being put at risk as a result of this state of affairs , including in my own area of the east of England . #% But one issue leaves us divided : should regions be able to appeal to the Court of Justice against acts which they dislike , notably because they feel they violate their own responsibilities or the principle of subsidiarity ? #% There is no real answer . #% However , although I am sympathetic to a number of the points she raises , in certain respects I suggest that her proposals go too far . #% What I would like the Commission to do , if it intends to reply today , is to say what it means to propose in terms of intervening in this global crisis ; not just about the Russian crisis , which is partly institutional and political and partially due to the immaturity of Russia 's market economy , but about the global operation of the world 's economy . #% This legal action against those who are trying to restrict an open European energy market will be welcomed by all those of us who believe in free markets and the completion of the single market . #% Finally , I should like to congratulate you , Mr President , on your election . #% I therefore urge the European Union , as a party to the Kimberley Process , to raise this scandal at the highest level and insist on the restoration of consensus-based decision making in the Kimberley Process . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Commission on its synthesis report and on keeping up the pressure on the Council and this House to deliver the promises made in the Lisbon process . #% I also welcome recent calls by President Medvedev for the Libyan tyrant , Muammar Gaddafi , to leave power . #% We should also do our best to give as much autonomy as we can to schools and colleges . #% This is a scandal . #% Now we seem to be supporting the ban rather than being an interested , neutral observer . #% That is the only way in the long run that we can really feel satisfied we are making a real contribution to end this appalling horror . #% There seems to be no mechanism within the existing rules and obligations where a company like Telefónica itself can be subject to some sort of punitive measures . #% I very much urge the House to approve this measure . #% That is something to celebrate . #% Let us get some credit for our support and if , in the process of attracting publicity , we also subject the workings of the fund and its governing body to more scrutiny then so much the better for transparency . #% To what extent is the Commission evaluating the success of the aid it has given to returnee refugees and how does it intend developing those programmes in future ? #% On democratic accountability we heard from Mr Duisenberg his views on how we will deal with the European Central Bank in the future . #% At this stage I do not think that we should seek to impede the EU-Mexico agreement of December 1997 which includes the issue of human rights since the Mexican Government is taking action on the issues of this massacre . #% In order for this universal service to be provided , it is necessary to reserve enough of the profitable postal services of the post office so that the post offices can also finance their unprofitable services . #% We have Mr Byrne responsible for some issues and Mrs Wallström responsible for others , particularly as regards GMOs . #% The pre-conciliation process - if I can call it that - that we have been going through is an example of how to take measures through Parliament and the institutions . #% This will inevitably mean a loss of talent from London to countries outside the EU . #% I want to make one other brief point , because this dispute highlights the need for earlier and more forthright discussions about the many issues over which there are disagreements . #% Altogether this is an ill-conceived , irrational and ultimately unnecessary piece of legislation . #% Nevertheless , I engage constructively with the EU reality , and I recognise the positive role Javier Solana has played , through the Quartet in the Middle East , in promoting long-term peace between Israel and Palestine . #% Instead , the report quite correctly identifies as a potential model , the Chilean deposit system , which introduces an incentive for investors to invest long-term in an emerging market rather than going for short term paper because that involves a longer-term investment for depositors . #% Europol is totally unnecessary from any objective point of view , but the EU 's subjective point of view is that it is essential to have another of those attributes of a political state : its own police force . #% That deal with the Council and with the Portuguese Presidency said that we would agree in this Parliament this week prior to the Council of Ministers ' meeting in June . #% That is why we welcome it . #% Unless we extend qualified majority voting in the new Treaty throughout the whole realm of Community legislation at the very least , then there will be no point in discussing the best ways to carry out national or European parliamentary scrutiny . #% I would underline what Mr Böge said to the Council . #% Madam President , for many Liberal Democrats the opt-out represents an important principle of subsidiarity . #% At the moment , Romania has a unique opportunity , unequalled in modern times , to make very swift progress . #% These are questions asked by consumers , which you would indeed ask of anything you took - even a wine gum . #% Perhaps you could address that , and take it up with the services , so that in future we may be given more knowledge about these instances . #% Madam President , I welcome the joint resolution supported by my group which is before the House today . #% WTO rules must also be reformed to allow governments to make the vital distinctions that need to be made between products on the basis of the way in which they have been produced . #% What progress is being made to ensure that accounting procedures are standardised and sufficiently transparent to capture off-balance-sheet activity and any other innovative practices ? #% Its priority is your priority : to make Europe more competitive and prosperous . #% It will not be insignificant either if our Parliament endorses that Constitution in December by an overwhelming majority . #% However , when an amendment passed which specifically condemned the decision to take military action which has already started , and which involves some of our own countries , I found it impossible to give my support . #% Moves by Israel now to comply with international law would be a tremendous confidence-building measure and an important step on the road to stability in the Middle East . #% The European Commission has taken no effective action on fraud and maladministration beyond persecuting the journalist who exposed the whole affair and the whistleblowers . #% Why , when the magistrate said yesterday that there was no real evidence against them , are they still being held ? #% My abiding memory was of the sense of exclusion felt by developing countries . #% 
I am afraid the spammers who are already breaking the law are going to carry on breaking the law . #% Our challenge is to ensure that Member States carry on with their own provision , but with coordination and cooperation and the sharing of best practice throughout the European Union . #% I fear that if Parliament simply agrees the line proposed by the PPE-DE and PSE Groups , we will be signing up to the same paralysis that exists within the Council . #% Finally , I would like to congratulate Mr Deva on his report , thank him for his kind words in his speech and endorse what he says . #% He said that in city like Cracow you can see , touch , feel history and culture all around . #% What we are seeing is an attempt to manipulate the trade policy of the European Union - which , unfortunately , the UK is bound by for the moment - in order to implement by stealth a largely Socialist agenda that has been consistently rejected . #% I will give you another example . #% in writing . - British Conservatives abstained on this report since , whilst we disagree with its contents , the proposal acknowledges that the United Kingdom is exempt from the provisions . #% We must have military thinking which reflects the new realities , as has happened in the United Kingdom with the defence review . #% Over the coming months , we need to see dramatic results as well as further steps to improve the effectiveness and resources of the police , investigative and judicial services . #% We felt it was also important to support the position of Mr Deprez , as the need for this proposal itself is more the result of bureaucratic delay than decision-making . #% How else can we move towards more sustainable production and consumption practices ? #% These are people with haemophilia , primary immune deficiency , albumen tetanus needs , acquired deficiencies , auto-immune diseases and Rhesus negative pregnant women . #% I am delighted that this research is happening in my constituency , but unless such research and development happens in Africa too , the immense potential of photovoltaics to deliver megawatts of electricity across Africa will never be realised . #% A number of other colleagues have told me that they had had similar , though not such severe , symptoms . #% The statement about getting the secretaries-general to look at how the institutions can work together is all very well but there is a much greater issue . #% Why are we paying all this money to a group of countries that sell us far more than we sell them ? #% In my own country , mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges . #% Mr President , on behalf of my Group , I would also like to congratulate the Irish presidency on its approach and on the method it is taking , which I believe is the right one . #% We must have a concerted , organised and united approach to prevent illegal imports . #% First of all this should ensure that roads are kept open during national disputes so that trade between European countries can continue to take place and foreign drivers are not affected , and then , if that fails , there is a code of practice which makes sure that financial compensation is always paid by the Member State concerned , and that compensation is paid quickly . #% The problem in eastern England , the region I represent , is that we have neither decent roads nor decent railways . #% We have to stop that drain . #% I sometimes say that , in the Committee on Petitions , ` all human life is there ' . #% Nevertheless , I am pleased to see that the Committee on Budgets has supported the view of Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy in restoring some of the budget lines which we are particularly concerned with , at least to the level of the PDB . #% I hope the Commissioner can correct that impression . #% It is both a consumer-friendly proposal and also an important plank of the single market . #% Other disabilities arise out of malnutrition , for example blindness , and vitamin deficiency . #% As the IGC takes place there are two aspects , therefore , that we in the European Parliament should remember . #% This Summit is incredibly important to our citizens and we have to set out what Stockholm means for them . #% The regional CBI claimed in the evidence that they gave to the inquiry conducted in the United Kingdom , that they were not listened to , that they were not involved properly in the procedures , and that for a government that is committed to the business community , large sums of money were given to the privatized utilities in the United Kingdom , rather than to small or medium-sized enterprises . #% It is absurd for the representatives of the people of Europe to travel halfway round the world only to be spectators at a conference where the people negotiating on their behalf are not directly elected on a European mandate . #% Europe 's engineers want to work on a mutual recognition platform , but they do not want one imposed by this Parliament working in one particular direction . #% I say to the Commissioner this morning and to this Parliament that we are relying on this being implemented this year within the budget and we will , as we say in this resolution , be looking to build on it next year . #% We feel strongly , therefore , that without those kinds of provisions in the next round of negotiations , it will simply become politically unsellable and unsustainable within Europe . #% All this gives the impression that economic and commercial pressures were put before consideration of public health and protection of the environment . #% Tunisia 's Constitution provides for freedom of association , but within certain defined limits . #% The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes . #% This is an attempt to make the reform a success and to ensure that the Commission has the right people to do the jobs that we expect it to do . #% There is no doubt in my mind that in most cases the operators are best qualified to organise training . #% As we remember from the post-election protests in December last year , Lukashenko is intolerant of dissent and seems to take pleasure in using violence and intimidation against pro-democracy activists . #% I am sure the Council will appreciate the anguish of the family of this murdered man . #% It also anticipates ratification of the Constitution , which is unlawful . #% To satisfy the greed of large companies in Europe , this place turns a blind eye to a humanitarian disaster . #% But the Kyoto process is going to be very much harder . #% This must , in my view , be accompanied by a reduction in the length of drug patents in poor countries . #% Why is there not mutual recognition of the same facts between a civil and a criminal case ? #% Followers of all faiths , save its own peculiar form of Islam , face persecution and where torture and mutilation are rife . #% What I saw was that , despite the commitments of the government , the discrimination continues , partly because it seems to be ingrained in the society and almost institutionalised . #% Many people in poorer countries have said to me they are sick and tired of not having a choice , of having to go to a state monopoly that performs badly or to a private monopoly that they all know has links to the ruling elite . #% Any committee of inquiry must get to grips with this central question about the efficiency of infringement proceedings . #% This is the kind of exercise which , if the EU can not hang together , with its candidate and aspirant states , makes people despair of a common foreign and security policy . #% The weakness of your Commission , Mr Frattini , was brought out in your remarks . #% But we still see the agriculture and industry directorate taking the predominant role . #% My group , the ECR , wants the euro area to succeed for those who choose to be its members . #% The international community , including the EU , has a responsibility now to address the collapse of world coffee prices and to alleviate that terrible suffering which Mr Wijkman talked about - 25 million coffee-dependent poor farmers and the communities in which they live . #% But I would urge that the real route to economic prosperity in Europe is , as Mr Karas eloquently stated , structural and economic reform which will lead to sustainable prosperity , an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment . #% I am pleased that the previous speaker had information given to him . #% Would the Commissioner comment on whether he feels such a proposal is timely and whether he would be interested in participating in such a meeting ? #% The changes that we have particularly focused on at second reading concern some further important enhancements to the provision for disabled users . #% We are sure that the Commission is doing its very best to ensure that it is put to good use , but we are part of the budgetary authority . #% We are actually killing hundreds and hundreds of local fishermen every year and what we are doing to the seas off Africa is the environmental equivalent to setting fire to the Serengeti . #% Despite six years of negotiation , it now appears that the new US Administration is backing off and is unwilling to support the terms that have been negotiated to date , including by its own predecessors . #% There appears to have been some use of state aids to support the position of the CSOB in order to support the position of a private sector rival to the IPB . #% But , if anyone were to read that Regulation , he would see that the infringement proceedings are a particular exception under Article 4 . #% Mr President , can I start by congratulating the rapporteurs Arroni , Torres Marques and Wolf on three excellent reports dealing in great detail with the euro . #% 
Now the EU wants a common energy policy so it can get its hands on what remains of Britain 's gas and oil reserves . #% We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in `` high quality '' , which means it must use good , Scottish peat water . #% I proposed to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that a driver should receive prior notice of commencement of a period of availability 24 hours in advance . #% HMS Tireless is safe in British territory and the repairs will be carried out to the highest safety standards . #% We are looking here at a downward spiral of social and environmental standards ; certainly minimum international standards might help stem that downward spiral . #% Sadly , as so often in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee , it now embodies amendments that are less sensitive and certainly less sensible . #% One in three flights in Europe is delayed . #% As soon as this round of enlargement is over , we must reconsider our policies to other countries in Europe . #% At present it is not clear whether and to what extent Islamic extremists from outside the region have incited or financed the incursions . #% There were some signs under the previous Presidency but not I am afraid under this one , that they did actually care about European citizens . #% One of his lasting legacies is an understanding of the continuing need of the strength of the three political institutions of the EU and for mutual respect between them . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , it is a pleasure to welcome Commissioner Kuneva to the House once again . #% Madam President , history does not always repeat itself but often we can see eerie similarities . #% There is simply no alternative to collective action on this issue . #% So why does gold plating affect the UK more than any other Member State ? #% Whilst the proposal , from my point of view , does not go far enough , it signals the end of the existing battery cage system of production . #% On all these issues there is consensus . #% We need the assurance that care will be integrated into Natura 2000 via the structural funds . #% Something still has to be done and more has to be done to meet the needs of these children . #% Recently , though , I have been able to assure people that the policy is undergoing significant change . #% They will speak in more detail now . #% I welcome Mrs Flemming 's question and would also suggest to the Commissioner that there is a way through . #% Firstly , we need to ensure radioactive material must only be carried in containers meeting the latest , International Atomic Energy Agency requirements . #% We have been here all morning dealing with some very trivial amendments . #% Let me spend a moment to share with you a case I had in private practice as a lawyer before I was elected to this Parliament . #% I shall concentrate on the broad economic guidelines . #% Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives . #% Neighbouring ASEAN countries need to do more to bring about change in Burma . #% These demonstrate an unchecked rise of religious fanaticism in that country , despite President Musharraf 's rhetoric . #% We have to fight terrible wars against terrible people . #% Article 152 requires respect for the autonomy of social partners , not this type of interference , and Article 153 expressly excludes EU action in the field of play . #% When , Mr President , will the Commission go further on spatial planning and submit new proposals to develop the decision taken at the informal Council meetings , notably at Potsdam and Tampere ? #% As the Commissioner knows , she has made me a very happy man today , but hopefully she has made a lot of other people very happy too ! #% We know that quite a lot has moved forward . #% As most of the items in the Commission 's programme appear also in my draft for a federal Union it is clear that I sha n't be your fiercest critic and , while I commend the firm rejection of an idea of a Super-President of the Council , I do have concerns and reservations about the proposal for an executive Presidency of the Council . #% Let me also point out for those who can not witness it , the sadness that the Council is not here to attach the due importance to this extremely important report . #% Finally , reflecting on his point about United Commissions or United Nations , how far will the Member States go along with this . #% The rule talks about Parliament having a right to give a view on a proposal , but it seems that you have merely an opinion , not a proposal . #% We are glad that after eight days of sitting under tarpaulins in the hot sun and inside containers , the Afghan refugees are now at least in reasonable conditions on board the ship on a long voyage to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea . #% All I can say from my experience is that somebody must be picking on Manchester very badly because I have not yet flown with Sabena from Brussels to Manchester when we have ever got anywhere near a 20-minute delay . #% The House is committed , but that is not enough . #% Nevertheless , can I ask you to confirm that it is quite inappropriate for Members of this House - Liberals or otherwise - to seek to persuade you to hear them . #% Mr President , nearly ten years ago , in the early 1990s , I travelled through the Khyber Pass , a trip I can strongly recommend to all colleagues - though perhaps not at this moment . #% The industry says that it will cost GBP 1 billion a year and cause a shortfall of 65 000 drivers , ramping up prices and knocking UK trade . #% So what now ? #% There is no chance for the European Parliament to propose amendments to it through our normal procedures . #% But when safety measures are in place and appear to be working , they should also be acknowledged . #% For example , that communication starts by saying that the growth of the air transport industry is , and I quote , `` unsustainable and must be reversed because of its impact on climate and on the quality of life and health of European citizens '' and it goes on to say very clearly that ` business as usual ' is not an option . #% With respect , we are still not very clear whether the Commission intends share fishermen to be included in this article or not . #% On tackling and identifying hazardous substances in construction products , we managed to broker a compromise ensuring no conflict with existing REACH regulations . #% The success of Lisbon rests with you , Mr Barroso . #% So let us back the proposal that this fish be cited on Appendix I. Let us just remember it is time we tried to control mankind 's greed ; it is time we tried to give a bit of thought to the future of our seas . #% It relates to the whole issue of whether Parliament should be handling technical directives . #% They hunted as a pack , they stood together and we were unable to prise them apart or to check facts because they had come to admit nothing and to concede nothing . #% The moral of this story is , of course , that to compete in the mainstream market , eco-products must give a performance close to their alternatives . #% Mr President , I rise on a point of order under Rule 166 . #% Current sanctions against the Burmese regime are due to expire on 29 April . #% We need to demand much more of Member States . #% But when we are discussing tobacco we are talking about a product which is harmful to health wherever you happen to live , and that is the main argument . #% Of course , the EU 's relationship with the House of Saud is based on regional stability and on important commercial ties , in particular oil and arms trading . #% Can I , however , make the plea that the Council 's annual consolidated report on the code is published , so strengthening transparency and giving the European Parliament an opportunity to debate and comment on the code 's implementation . #% This may be the political equivalent of a cheque in the post , but I understand that the Council and Commission are committed to pursing a robust discussion on democracy and human rights issues under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement . #% With consensus seemingly breaking out between Parliament and Council , I was pleased to be able to support the Council 's text and the agreed amendments , even if the latter were , in the end , not adopted . #% Everything that has happened since has vindicated the strong support which Parliament gave to this programme . #% This requires changes not only in the European Commission with which we are all familiar , but also changes in the European Parliament itself . #% We need to be certain that throughout the Community the same measures are in effect , the same points of contact are available and information is wisely considered , assessed and shared . #% 
Commissioner , as you know , organised crime is growing very strongly . #% It is perhaps Parliament ' s role to ask for more . #% Pakistan has had USD 10 billion dollars of aid from the USA in about the last five or six years , mostly for anti-terrorism measures , and not for the maintenance and development of education . #% Mr Rocard , your amendments really focus on little more than programs on personal computers rather than the vast array of important technology that depends on computer-implemented inventions . #% It is impossible to separate the question of China ' s accession to the WTO from our wider consideration of the EU ' s position in Seattle . #% Naturally we sympathise with that objective and we are therefore contacting relevant Member States with a view to securing faster compliance with Community law and reducing Member States own handling times , particularly by greater use of the computerised system . #% Firstly , I should like to give the strongest support to action to halt the scourge of late payments which threaten so many of our small businesses . #% These measures therefore also close the loop-hole which currently prevents Member States from investigating accidents involving their own citizens . #% Paying respect to this particular report is easy because it looks at the differing forms of economic units as well - the mutual societies , the cooperatives , the SMUs - and this is all essential if we are to have the kind of success which we know is relevant for the progress of this report . #% Ministers are going to the Council of Ministers , signing their names to documents agreed after co-decision and then simply not keeping their word . #% I was fascinated by Mr Rübig 's question , particularly as it refers to the Committee of Inquiry that I chaired . #% However , when it comes to the inspection of the premises where foodstuffs are being prepared , there must be independent examination . #% Mr President , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy effectively does not have much supervision over large parts of the budget . #% Those who deferred our hopes should listen now . #% They are there , threatening campesinos that they must plant coca or they will die . #% They either have to change or die . #% Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are . #% He made a very strong point that part of the problem with the internal market is actually not the lack of legislation , but the consistent enforcement and effectiveness of the existing instruments that we have in place to create the internal market . #% From the outset it is noticeable that the annual policy strategy treats the budget year of 2007 as one of a continuing series in the life of the Commission to implement the well-established priorities of prosperity , solidarity , security and Europe as a global partner . #% Secondly , on religion and identity , there is an assertion that there is no exclusivity . #% That has been postponed . #% For them it has not produced extra choice , but rather the loss of life savings with no redress mechanisms available . #% In the European Commission , were that situation ever to arise , the President of the Commission does not have the possibility of asking that member to resign or leave the Commission . #% Looking back on the events of the last year , does the Commissioner now accept that the Commission has a lot to learn in its handling of internal disputes between high-ranking members of staff ? #% The same is true of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly . #% Furthermore , your meeting on 2 May at the EU/US Summit to update the New Transatlantic Agenda to meet new challenges must ensure that the political communities are properly involved . #% Mr President , I too want to speak about Mrs Haug ' s report on own resources . #% However , it is relevant to note that in this case the master of the vessel and the Portuguese authorities did not oppose the prolonged stay of the Canadian inspectors on the vessel and the fishing activities of the Santa Mafalda were not obstructed . #% That is not the right attitude , nor is it the way to get the European public on side . #% There is no point in one institution or another raising its game if the other institutions do not reciprocate . #% The likelihood is that the applicant states in eastern and central Europe will want to be like us as soon as possible - heaven help them . #% Mr President , may I too offer my congratulations to you on your election as first Vice-President . #% If we are to have a common asylum policy , we have also to deal with these additional needs and it makes sense to deal with them together . #% But many Member States do not have technical screening facilities or trained nurses in place . #% Well , that is one way of driving the indigenous population away , and all for useless turbines producing insignificant amounts of power at unpredictable times , located on remote islands so as to ensure that much of their pitiful output is lost in transmission . #% Can I urge you , please , to make sure that there is no third repeat of this . #% Mr President , as a representative for Cumbria - the area most affected by this disease in Europe - to think back 20 months is to remember the distress of farmers who , in many cases , saw their animals being slaughtered - although there was no evidence that they were infected - and , in particular , the distress of those who made their living from tourism in the Lake District . #% I am thinking in particular of things such as the withholding tax , which it would have been quite unacceptable to have subjected to a QMV regime . #% I congratulate Mr Andersson on his report . #% Thirty years of murderous assault and still he goes after the remnants of those unfortunate people . #% If the Commission can assure us and explain how the regulation respected the directive , that is an answer we can give to the petitioners . #% Our citizens must be very puzzled . #% In her spending commitments for the Palestine Authority , could the Commissioner envisage funding a new chamber for the Palestine Council ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I hope that I am proved to be wrong , but it looks to me increasingly unlikely that the talks begun and continued at Copenhagen will , in fact , lead to a legally binding treaty committing all of the major emitters in the world to large emission cuts . #% It is not really surprising ; it has been a long-standing policy commitment of the Labour Party , and was in Labour 's manifesto when it won power last year , so it is not surprising that this has come through . #% Coming from one of the more remote parts of Europe , namely Scotland , it is so important for us to be connected with the centre . #% The resolution also outlines the energy savings potential that SMEs have - currently only 24 % of SMEs are engaged in actions to reduce their environmental impact-energy efficiency ; if SMEs applied cost-effective energy efficiency measures , they could reduce their energy bills and increase reinvestment . #% Listening to the debate I feel that our group 's views are very much the centre of gravity of Parliament as a whole on this question . #% Amendment No 5 , from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , seeks an early revision of the regulation in order to include these workers . #% Let us not allow dangerous goods , which would pollute and damage health , to be carried in vehicles which are not up to what the Commission regards , and what we regard , as the highest possible standards . #% There we saw young animals being raised in pens , not in individual crates . #% The Schörling report , which we voted on a few months ago , called on the Commission to produce a definition of the substitution policy principle , so we can hardly deal with it now as though it really is in existence . #% My Group also aims to further strengthen the provisions on family unity . #% I will mention just one place : the equatorial region of the Democratic Republic of Congo , where the population is suffering a catastrophic death rate , not because of famine or even because of ongoing violence and insecurity , as is the case in the east of Congo , but simply because medical facilities are non-existent in that beautiful but inaccessible forest area . #% Chapter VII of the UN Charter authorises the use of force in the event of the arms embargo not being respected . #% The reason , as I mentioned before the Lisbon Summit , relates to those who are in the gallery with us today - the citizens of Europe . #% I believe in Parliament , and I believe in Europe , and future historians will understand that the spirit of Europe lives here . #% Some - and ` some ' is too many - kill themselves rather than face the consequences of their diagnosis . #% What we need , of course , is the Lisbon Agenda , not the Lisbon Treaty . #% Whilst I acknowledge the hard work of the rapporteurs , and no doubt their noble intentions , by trying to include everything in the 27-page text , the motion is confused and , in my view , a lot less valuable than the Stockholm Agenda and the Swedish Presidency deserve . #% Will the Commission be able to support the amendment that I plan to table in the Environment Committee which would allow the UK to prohibit the export of horses and ponies from the UK for slaughter or further fattening ? #% However , it is vital that Parliament , which has played such a crucial part in the IGC so far , does not fade at the final phase . #% These countries have signed up to the acquis communautaire and we expect them to satisfy its requirements before they enter the Union . #% The British Government is under an obligation to spend taxpayers ' money wisely and yet it goes on tamely writing the cheques to the European Union . #% Britain 's rule will end . #% Mr President , I simply wanted to say that if Mrs Lienemann was so worried it is a pity she did not take part in the debate and make her points to the Commissioner during the debate . #% 
World Health Day is a good moment for taking stock . #% They should not have been in Rome . #% There will be one or two small technical points that I would like to bring up tomorrow as oral amendments , just to clarify the text and for the sake of linguistic consistency . #% So it shows , as I said , that we are moving forward with all these projects . #% Mr President , I warmly support my good friend and colleague , our rapporteur , Mrs Jöns , in her work to strengthen this funding proposal . #% So we have promised something to our citizens we can not deliver . #% I have not spoken about the religious aspects of Sunday . #% Given the expectations now raised with Ukraine 's people , unless the EU accepts that Ukraine can have some kind of long-term aspiration of EU membership , it will be difficult for President Yushchenko to implement the much-needed political and economic reforms and win the parliamentary elections of 2006 . #% The Bonn Agreement merely states : ` The members of the Interim Administration shall abide by a Code of Conduct elaborated in accordance with international standards . ' #% I support some of the amendments . #% I would like to inform Commissioner Patten that it was not the intention of the House this evening to reject the association agreement but to defer it . #% As I said , my aim was to produce something that would not only lead to safety , but would also be workable and sets workable standards . #% My central objection is that the directive is economically illiterate . #% It is the inability of a train to cross borders without changing locomotives , changing drivers or even changing bogeys that is the problem for our railways . #% in writing . - Along with the majority of my group , I supported both parts of this amendment . #% It has to be shown that such an exception is necessary and the disclosure would cause harm . #% For the past few weeks , I , as chairman of the Committee on Budgets , have led the trialogue delegation seeking to alleviate the damage caused by Annex XV . #% Madam President , according to the Rules of Procedure , which we must respect , you need not consult the House . #% When formulating policy regarding poverty and social inclusion , we must listen to people at the sharp end - in other words , those who are experiencing poverty and homelessness themselves . #% There is a place for organic farming , but we must accept that if the whole world was to embrace organic farming , we would starve . #% Mr President , in welcoming this report I should like to highlight the purpose of my own amendments to the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation . #% There is no real danger of that . #% In 1998 my own government appointed a child rights expert from Save The Children to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to develop strategies and practical projects in relation to children 's rights . #% We know that Turkey 's problem is that the government is weak and the state is strong . #% There is no dignity in dying of motor neurone disease and there is precious little dignity in suffering from Parkinson 's either . #% That was before the last European elections . #% I feel that , very often , that economic role is ignored , and we do not talk about it ; we do not even think about it , and we relegate culture to second-class status . #% I would like the Council to pay due attention to those two conditions . #% It has also allowed restrictions on freedom of movement , as my Hungarian colleague has said . #% These are the exciting urban regeneration initiatives that we should be supporting . #% That is how we sustain our considerable lead in world markets . #% The finance available for measures to reduce CO2 emissions in poorer countries will be greatly reduced without US participation . #% Syria must play a more responsible role in apprehending terrorists crossing from its territory into Iraq . #% But what about People First and other self-advocacy organisations ? #% That was in October 2003 , long before all of the action plan had even been implemented . #% Mr Mandelson , these countries are our natural allies , but unless we really prove that we have in place a Doha development mandate , and that we are honouring that mandate , then I believe that in the months ahead we will not be able to rely on our ACP colleagues . #% We demand the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi , as well as the release of all political prisoners and the lifting of restrictions against the NLD , universities and other institutions . #% Mr Rasmussen , Mr Watson and Mr Haarder have been very liberal in saying that once the political criteria have been met we can give a date for Turkey . #% It is time for it to end . #% Either way , it is clear that security forces in some Member States are working outside the reach of proper and effective governmental control and scrutiny . #% In the United Kingdom there are currently nine environmental directives which should already have been transposed since the Commissioner came to office , not one of which has yet been put into practice . #% Secondly , we concede that there might be more than a single competent authority in some Member States and we permit the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market not only to give a reasoned opinion upon the matter of competence but also to prepare an indicative non-definitive list of such authorities . #% All the more reason to do it for products which , as I fully accept , contribute to human happiness and wellbeing . #% Similarly , the proposal that financial assistance could be given only where objectives had been met purely by a reduction in capacity seemed unfair to those fleets where capacity and activity reductions had been combined . #% I would also like to welcome the decisions taken by the Council and the Commission . #% Mr President , it has been an interesting debate and I should just like perhaps to add a note of realism . #% With the Services Directive in place , thanks to our efforts , more of those minds can be unleashed on delivery of services . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I want to congratulate the European Ombudsman , Mr Södermann , on his excellent annual report for 1996 . #% My view is that the Olympics should be transferred forthwith to Athens and remain there forever . #% In other words , refusal of discharge was tantamount in itself to a sort of motion of censure on the Commission . #% So I am pleased to hear about the expert teams , but the Commission should not underestimate how many of them will be needed in many parts of the Union . #% Nevertheless , I will also be visiting that country soon to make up my own mind and have an independent assessment . #% I appreciate the support of the British taxpayer who funds my vaccines and I am frustrated that the EU needs to be involved at all . #% What we need in the loading and unloading of cargo is a dedicated , trained , experienced set of people , not an onboard workforce which would be exposed to the dangers of hurriedly loading and unloading cargo . #% For the future , the way to ensure that responses are maximised is to continue working through these agencies , ensuring that resources are used wisely and efficiently . #% Madam President , for centuries British fishermen looked after their fishing grounds -- the waters up to 200 miles off the coast . #% I say to this Parliament that after the events of September 11 , we took a view in the civilised world that terrorism was indivisible . #% After the vote , when I returned to my office I found a fax from my Coventry office . #% I support the idea that Bulgaria should be able to join the EU , but I do not believe at this point in time either that they are really ready for membership or that the Union is ready to receive them . #% There are dangers lurking . #% Today 's report seeks to agree a legal base for decentralized cooperation for the budget heading specifically created by Parliament as far back as 1992 . #% Bearing in mind that over the past decade we have lost some 12 , 000 lives at sea throughout the world - and , indeed , continue to lose more than 200 ships a year throughout the world , we in the European Union need to be constantly on guard to enhance and improve the standards of safety at sea . #% Mr President , I would like to begin by apologising to the Presidency . #% To secure our European future , like the British , most people in Europe want to be in Europe but not run by Europe . #% Glyn Ford raised an important issue about the way in which we use human rights clauses . #% This puts the whole visit in an entirely different context . #% 
It demonstrates what tenacity can achieve . #% Having said that , I am and have always been in favour of an intelligent and flexible interpretation . #% If you can not fit solar panels and can not repair your energy systems , you are not going to meet your climate change targets . #% Others gave background support . #% We call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to take charge of the small patch of the marshlands still undrained that remains within its country . #% If we are to support this resolution then Iraq must most definitely honour its obligations under all the United Nations resolutions . #% This has caused a certain amount of concern and distress in political circles in the UK , because as , I am sure you know , the protocol of such meetings is that they are private and should not be commented on . #% It seems to me that racism and hooliganism in football are combining . #% In the case of Syria , there is also the issue of support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah . #% I want to emphasize the point made by Mrs Ewing and contradict the point made by Mr David . #% Already almost 50 % of the British electorate are in favour of withdrawal . #% Madam President , we are constantly told to listen to the people , not least by the Greek President this very morning . #% Mr Miller produced a very interesting report , with much of which I disagreed . #% In my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping . #% We know very well that this is just the first step in the process . #% As regards some of the other points which were raised , it is hoped that improving the quality of the system in certain Member States will be able to increase confidence between Member States and deblock some of the other parts of the asylum system , as well as helping Member States feel that there is support when they are facing particular burdens . #% I am interested that the Commission has put in a sanction to say that there will be no payments through FIFG until this is agreed . #% We welcome the report 's suggestions on maritime governance , on sea basin initiatives and strategies , on maritime spatial planning and surveillance , a maritime research framework and observation and data network , and a fund for maritime infrastructure . #% But that is a false argument and a difficult one . #% This is what happens in practice . #% It emphasises our commitment to protecting our environment and applying equal procedures in each Member State . #% As regards agriculture we can make the points made by our colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture , especially the priorities which they see for agriculture , and we can talk about category 2 and the CFSP . #% Such a Public Prosecutor would be an unacceptable interference in the constitutional responsibility of Member States for their judicial systems . #% Interestingly enough the Treaty has given us the authority to do that without fear of being challenged later on , which can only be to the benefit of lone parents . #% Mr President , I find it slightly bizarre to talk about the precautionary principle in relation to weapons , which are after all designed to be bad for your health . #% Sanctions against the Mugabe regime should continue without interruption and without exemption . #% The Constitution sadly failed those basic tests . #% Normally I say that when we face problems of this nature in the appliance of science , we should turn to the science itself to find a solution . #% First , we in the PSE Group do not want any hint that a bilateral FTA can substitute for a successful completion of the Doha Development Round . #% The plane was half an hour late . #% Could we have two separate votes , please , first on Mr Sonik 's oral amendment , and second on the UEN-Schulz-Poettering package ? #% That is something which the Commission , particularly the internal market Commissioner , Mr Bolkestein , will be pleased to support . #% But when I read the conclusions , it is very clear that we have actually been very positive toward Turkey . #% But having listened closely both to the debate here today , and to the answers we have been given from the Commissioners designate in the Parliamentary Hearings over the past few weeks , I still have a number of grave concerns and reservations . #% Would the Council kindly point out to the United Nations that we need a much quicker response than three and a half weeks if such incidents happen in future , as we fear may happen . #% Will there be the objections we have heard from Member States on the grounds of subsidiarity which means they want to hold on to the money and do not want to let our towns and cities take part ? #% In addition , attempts by myself and others to ensure that the focus of the label remained on heritage , and not on political integration , were rejected . #% With reference to Dublin II , we are also aware that the fear of consequences makes some states reluctant to act and assume responsibility because they feel they are on their own . #% He will be aware that I and others were somewhat concerned that in the Green Paper there was very little , if any , reference to the issue of conflict prevention . #% Let us look at the politics . #% I am glad it has been rejected . #% We hope you , Commissioner , will continue to act to ensure that this vital link in the single market is restored . #% Amendments Nos 4 , 7 , 8 and 9 are intended to maintain the status quo in relation to both these requests . #% I am pleased to say that the route we are now taking , which has been agreed by most of the main players , is likely to lead to success . #% For Parliament not to be consulted or not to have any appropriate say at the next stage of proceedings would be a total absurdity and I hope that this will be taken into account when you consider the rulings you are giving tomorrow and when the Commission reflects on what it said in removing almost all of these amendments from the book . #% It would be nice to have answers to those questions , because one of the problems is that , given the current base for EHLASS has already ended , neither the injury prevention scheme nor the legal framework for consumer policy , on which I would like to see this based , will actually begin until 1999 . #% Mr President , I welcome the Finnish Presidency , which I assume will be carried out with the usual Finnish efficiency and professionalism . #% However , we can not support the growing trend for harmonisation of criminal law within the EU and can not therefore support this report . #% On behalf of the Socialist Group today , I would like to say that we need to meet with Wim Duisenberg before the summer recess of this Parliament to flesh out and spell out in detail the way in which the European Parliament will in future deal with the European Central Bank . #% Commissioner Michel , I would urge you -- perhaps in your reply -- just to confirm that the Commission , you and your colleagues will be working extremely closely with the British Presidency to ensure the successful initiation and implementation of the Baltic Sea strategy , which will be seen as a natural extension -- a complement -- to the work of the Northern Dimension . #% What , for example , is the cost of a long-hours culture in terms of damage to family life , damage to children and marital dysfunction ? #% You are not listening but never mind , I shall carry on . #% I believe this is a similar mistake that will lessen the attention that must be paid to extreme right-wing organisations and parties in the Union , particularly within some of the new Member States . #% I also welcome the move to delay the entry into force of this legislation until 31 December 2003 : airlines need time to carry out the necessary retraining and to purchase additional equipment . #% Another is the process of actually having a genuine single market - which we still do not yet have - and skills training that will be the key to delivering that innovative and knowledge-driven society . #% That is not the same as an immigration policy , and people really should recognise the difference . #% Why is there this fear , this wish to keep secret a document that is already half-known ? #% Our insistence on an inclusive approach should include a fair result by the 15th anniversary of the Dayton Agreement . #% That is not in anybody 's interests . #% Likewise , David Blunkett said that many regulations were being passed which were impossible to implement . #% What we need is the political will to achieve it . #% So , as you say , it is in the Treaty but it is up to Member State governments to change that . #% Indeed , the claim has been made that not one person has yet received clean drinking water under the ACP-EU initiative . #% I very much hope that the Council and the Commission , in whatever dealings that they have with these countries , will raise the issue on every possible occasion . #% These two amendments are reasonable and I hope colleagues will support them . #% When you yourself , Mr Van Rompuy , say that the euro has brought us stability , I suppose I could applaud you for having a sense of humour . #% 
In a 1997 report the Parliamentary Research Service noted that the only examples of successful management systems were to be found in the Falkland Islands , Iceland , Namibia and New Zealand , where fisheries fall within a single jurisdiction . #% This is why , along with a number of colleagues , I have submitted an amendment which would have the Commission proposal rejected in its entirety . #% One way of achieving this is to make sure the Employment Directive is implemented effectively across all Member States . #% I , like most Members in this House , believe that such Sharia punishments are totally unacceptable at the dawn of the 21st century . #% Make no mistake about it : we will have to decide what to do about the text . #% The new government team , particularly concerning the economy , balances its vitality and enthusiasm with professional competence and a degree of modesty in view of the tasks ahead . #% We have perhaps a once-in-a-generation chance to look in detail at the implementation process of EU law , taking one particular directive as an example . #% It is very important to point out that , as the Commissioner is very well aware , in other regions of Africa , for example West Africa - I was recently in Côte d'Ivoire - and in the Great Lakes area , we are now seeing peace breaking out . #% A concerted time-limited effort is needed , otherwise we are still going to be talking about this in ten years ' time . #% Well , at least I have been elected , Sir , unlike her ! #% We must have a balanced package . #% So , can I ask you to give Mr Liikanen the floor ? #% You said you would reflect on further action you would take . #% We need better and more comprehensive impact assessment and we need to look at whether legislation is really needed at EU level , or best left up to Member States in many instances . #% On the other hand , I want the Tamil Tigers to cease their violence completely , stop using child soldiers and return the child soldiers they are using to their families . #% That way , consumers can buy them with great confidence and we in the farming community can produce them with great confidence . #% It is not , it is chocolate and you had better get used to that fact . #% You have come back to us today and now , with the approval of Mr Sarkozy and Angela Merkel , you are the head of a new economic government for 500 million people and you have launched your 10-year plan - your wish list . #% We learn from the Commission document of poor compliance and in some cases the total lack of compliance by Member States , the widespread flouting of legislation which is the cause , as we all know , of all too many accidents . #% Some countries , such as Greece , Italy and Portugal , currently fail even to record racial attacks . #% Finally , let us not forget consumer rights . #% Regulations on driving time and rest periods are important , because of the number of serious coach and lorry accidents caused by driver fatigue . #% Will you do that next ? #% The Commissioner is asked to maintain her enquiries in this respect and I would be grateful if she could address this point in particular in her reply . #% Mr President , like motherhood and apple pie , no-one could possibly be against safety , especially when it involves aeroplanes . #% President Voronin , whom I met a year ago , in spite of being a Communist and ethnically Russian , is committed to EU and NATO approximation for his country after a row with President Putin , who failed to withdraw Russian troops by 2002 from Transnistria , as agreed . #% I thank Parliament 's staff and , in particular , my assistant , Vikki Phillips , who has made a very considerable contribution to this process over the past year . #% Some Members of this House have a reflex anti-Americanism . #% We shall examine each of these requests in turn . #% Member States lose even more control of their own destinies while having to pay the - as yet unknown - cost for the privilege . #% Mr President-in-Office , thank you for that very wide-ranging answer . #% I am quite sure that my constituent 's E111 was in a better state than this one , which was issued in 1990 . #% I commend the report to Parliament . #% We also saw the destruction of the European Union 's three pillars contrived at the Treaty of Maastricht and our response today requires a fully integrated approach involving trade , finance and security . #% I would like the Commission to take an initiative , along the lines of President Barroso 's commitment , to deal with the problem of racism in football . #% Thanks to increased competition , the level of fares in the EU - on some routes at least - continues to fall and more and more passengers are able to fly . #% Whilst I realise that there are subsidiarity implications for this flexibility it is also true that by having different information and different formats in different Member States this could distort the single market and confuse consumers who wish to buy in different states . #% There is no single argument for this in terms of programme quality ; no single argument for it in terms of the diversity of services . #% It is clear then that action is urgently needed . #% We need to start spelling that out now and working out the method of operation in ensuring democratic accountability . #% We have , however , regularly expressed our concern on two issues . #% Mr President , I totally endorse what the Commissioner said . #% That led to the end of the beef ban in August of this year , but not , apparently , in France . #% As a member of the Delegation for relations with the United States , I will be doing precisely that as soon as possible . #% It should also insist that we have observers on all these vessels to ensure that TACs are observed . #% The governments of developing countries have a responsibility to invest in their own people , but we in the European institutions have a responsibility to make sure that flexible mechanisms for debt relief are available . #% Yet I doubt that it will achieve much practical effect . #% Colleagues , actions speak louder than words . #% I am pleased that the Commissioner made such reference to the support that we give to regulators throughout eastern Europe , because this is the area that gives us the greatest concern . #% Does it want reform because of enlargement or because of the WTO ? #% They are particularly important in terms of socially useful employment and it is an omission that they are missing from the report . #% It represents all that is wrong with the European Union and we believe that it , like the EU , should be abolished with immediate effect - reform is not an option . #% Let us target Mr Mugabe , not the citizens of Zimbabwe , and let us ensure that our actions are effective and not merely international window-dressing . #% I am not proposing to accept any further amendments to the text , even though a number have come in rather late in the day from the Socialist Group . #% If Europe is to deliver for its citizens -- and it has to -- our economy has to be competitive . #% Those were the three points that our committee was concerned about . #% This has been amplified by the report but there is nothing new in it . #% Instead , we must dump a large cold bucket of logic , common sense and international law onto the head of the US Government and bring it to its senses . #% It is the case that we should not underestimate , as Mrs Sandbæk has said , the ACP 's concerns , but it is wrong for Mrs Sandbæk to say that there is no dialogue on budgetisation . #% I thank Mr De Rossa for his assurance that this report does not and can not refer to deer and elk management in Europe . #% I will speak only about Sri Lanka , a country I have visited , and a country many of whose citizens have sought refuge in London and other parts of the European Union . #% These very large increases in total allowable catches raise questions as to how far CCAMLR has just responded to requests from fishing nations for increased quotas and how far it has observed its own criteria for rigorous scientific analysis and control measures before opening up new fisheries . #% However , the agreement arrived at with Senegal obviously undermines to some extent the development objective of poverty alleviation , because the agreement gives the EU fleet and others , I presume , access to demersal species and to pelagic species , which are the principal source of protein not only for Senegalese people but also for those peoples of Africa who live in landlocked countries . #% In fact it is worse than cheating , because it puts the health of the athletes at risk . #% There are newspapers across Europe that are making a living exposing the errors and flaws of the European administration . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur . #% 
Forcing the disconnection of one person 's Internet connection would have an unintended and disproportionate impact on other innocent users of the same connection . #% My group also accepts the various compromises that have been made as regards the detail . #% The facts are clear , based on scientific studies . #% The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading . #% Mr President , would it not be simpler if rather than Members rising to advise you of their presence , that they do as I do and simply hand in a note to the sittings service ? #% Mr President , I wish to begin by dealing with the allegation contained in Mr Perry 's report that directives have not been implemented . #% Not all the amendments came from the Socialists . #% We now have a total reversal of that situation . #% We can leave this until next month . #% Her assiduous work for the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy will be greatly missed in the future . #% He is a perfect example of one of the many talented MEPs who have joined this Parliament following enlargement . #% It is a matter of frustration for many of us that our staff can access the net with their computers , of course , Parliament 's computers , but if we as parliamentarians bring in our own computers , we do not have a place to plug them in and work effectively . #% To scrap these successful schemes now would be to throw away the baby with the bath water . #% On behalf of the Liberal Group , I would also like to extend our thanks and congratulations to the Council and Commission , especially to Commissioner Lamy . #% I want to make the report unambiguously clear so that it can go through and Member States are absolutely clear what is expected of them . #% I think it is up to us in the European Parliament to extend every sympathy to the people of Belarus for the condition in which they find themselves . #% However , we note that the EU 's interpretation of human rights is a flawed one . #% It would not to my mind be the right place to finish , but it certainly would be the right place to start and it is the reason why I was convinced when I was there in the debate in the Industry Committee , as none of my colleagues from the Environment Committee were , that it was the right place to start . #% When they came for the trade unionists , I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist . #% Mr President , on a point of order , history seems to be repeating itself . #% I would also welcome the context change that was strongly put out by the Commission in terms of anti-racism and xenophobia , and would hope that every Member State government would commit itself to those ideals . #% in writing . - According to European law , 12 plenary sessions must take place every year at the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament . #% The report we have before us clearly addresses the issue of taxation . #% As a group of my very wise constituents from Northampton and Daventry said to me during the general election in the UK last year , in England my party -- the Conservatives -- polled more votes than the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrats . #% There are as yet no firm conclusions , but one loophole has been exposed . #% An eight-hour reference period will allow higher levels of exposure over a shorter period like one to two hours , which to my mind is unacceptable . #% With sufficient political will , the right military equipment and more troop numbers on the ground from all the Member States , NATO can defeat the Taliban and , of course , this must be coupled to a hearts-and-minds campaign as well . #% During his time in office , will he build on the already agreed enlargement programme ? #% We trust that the relevant authorities will bear this in mind this year and act on the proposal . #% That it why I support the Council 's common position - its compromise on the flexible use of airspace where civil access is permitted to designated military airspace when it is not in use . #% We have to ensure that consumers can tell from the labelling which products have met those high animal welfare standards in Europe . #% I also welcome the establishment of a new parliamentary body , Euronest , as a forum for MEPs and national parliamentarians to reinforce each others ' democratic mandates through dialogue including , for instance , facilitating Armenia and Azerbaijan to sit down together and discuss the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute , and negotiating free trade agreements and visa facilitation through these new association agreements . #% Given the present situation within the United Kingdom , the difficulties that it has in exporting and the railways there , and looking to the future of the whole transport policy of the European Union , I sincerely hope that as much pressure as possible can be brought to bear from all quarters to get this problem resolved as quickly as possible . #% Mr President , during Commission Question Time at the last part-session 34 questions were tabled by MEPs but only eight received answers , which is a new record . #% Madam President , I would like to endorse the point made by Mrs Lynne . #% I voted to reject the similar bill two years ago and , as a British Member , I am going to do the same again this week . #% This week , we have seen two such attacks , which have killed and injured more people than , for example , the London bombings . #% Will he give some thought to setting up a rapid response team dedicated to planning for the worst in the European Union ? #% Secondly , that when such an agency is set up , it should be looked at very carefully in terms of its transparency and accountability to this Parliament for its budget and structure , and there must be discharge given by the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% Nevertheless I am very proud that the European Parliament has passed amendments ensuring that action is taken against unfair public subsidies , that pilotage is excluded for good safety reasons , and - perhaps most important - that the new providers have to protect workers ' rights properly and work under the EU flag , not one of convenience . #% I am also led to believe that the supreme audit institutions are prepared to play their part in helping us to solve this problem . #% The first relates to the particular problems facing women returning to Rwanda . #% With specific reference to tonight 's proposals , firstly Mr Viceconte has produced a welcome contribution to the growing debate on the needs of people suffering from rare diseases set against the background of other preparations , for example on orphan drugs , plus the development of research principles and priorities . #% Although the Rules of Procedure allow any Group to call for a separate vote on any amendment , we ought to try and flush out which ones they wish to vote truly separately on . #% We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals . #% It plunged to DEM 3.45 against the dollar at the end of February 1985 , which is a third below its current rate of DEM 2.16 to the dollar . #% I believe that we need to be genuinely concerned about the impact of competition from companies based in China -- not just on Europe , but on poorer countries such as the EuroMed countries -- and recognise that until we have a system of managed trade , the winners will always be concentrated in a handful of ever fewer countries and the losers will prove to be the majority . #% The European Union rightly says that his subsequent sentence at a show trial to five years ' hard labour by the same judge who put Saad Ibrahim in jail for three years sent negative signals . #% If it is simply a case of how we upfronted our money , then that clearly is less of a problem . #% We have in the past too often neglected Asia and focused more on other regions of the world , but in fact it contains a majority of the world 's population . #% There are many more examples . #% I believe Thailand should be completely delisted from all poultry meat exports until that country can prove it has the infrastructure and the integrity to apply EU standards all the time . #% My second comment is specifically to the Council . #% I do not know quite whether I am more irritated by the recruiting campaigns of my Liberal Democrat and Scottish Nationalist colleagues , or by the Labour Party 's habit of behaving like a nervous jackal , circling around this issue and frightened to bite in case they damage Tony Blair 's frail reputation for patriotism . #% With the resurgence of nationalism in Russia and the growing social deprivation of the majority of the Russian people , it is both our duty and in our interest for Europe to work with Russia to enhance democracy , security and prosperity for all our citizens . #% It would be outrageous if governments such as the UK Government doing bilateral deals frustrated a Council initiative . #% Because we felt that what came out overall had a sense of balance to it , we are not going to be supporting many of the other amendments seeking to reinstate certain parts of the original text , e.g. Amendment 17 concerning GATS . #% We look forward to it enforcing and moving this out as soon as possible , particularly in the area of net neutrality , your declaration on which is warmly welcomed , because that is something that we fought very strongly for in my committee . #% I believe we are not only looking at a monetary union but we are looking at an economic union and it is right today that we should address the process of establishing a monetary union at the same time as we deal with the Annual Economic Report of the European Union . #% He has now taken the right step at the right time to show his personal commitment to a lasting peace . #% At the same time , we must acknowledge ASEAN 's decision to incorporate Burma , as well as Laos , and eventually Cambodia into the full block . #% But I want to make a particular point in relation to an alarm which has been raised in the United Kingdom by the agricultural sector literally in the last few days . #% Let us be certain as to what happened . #% To correct that we gave a statement in writing to the secretariat asking that it be corrected to show that we had voted for 4c . #% This is just the sort of thing we have to tackle if money laundering is to be challenged properly . #% Mr President , I also wish to endorse and praise the work of Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Böge on this issue and the initial proposals from the Commission . #% 
I am particularly pleased to see that vaccination has been promoted to being a vital tool in the fight against foot and mouth - this shift in emphasis that Commissioner Byrne spoke about . #% Is your announcement of pilot towns and cities mere window-dressing or will it unleash the potential of those towns and cities throughout Europe to contribute to the process of economic development ? #% You need only look at the agenda of the Committee on Petitions . #% The last point that I have time to make is to the producers of quality chocolate by the specialised methods we see in Belgium and some other areas . #% Human rights , if they are to be considered a casus belli as over Kosovo , must be universally and consistently applied . #% Mr President , on a point of order , following Mr Coates ' point , I think I can help the House . #% It is to us extraordinary insensitivity at this particular time , in this current climate , when you have an acting Commission , that someone can , in that particular state of office simply say two days later he wants to go and work for a private company which is one of the major operators in the field for which he is responsible in telecommunications . #% Turning now to the second aspect , which is value for money , this is an innovative concept where what we want to do is to stop throwing good money after bad . #% I feel that we will then have a database of the kind we need for the reporting of home and leisure accidents . #% I know that all parliamentary reports are collective efforts , but this one very much represented a collective effort by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy as a whole , including the shadow spokespeople . #% First , who made the commitment to the Visegrad states that they would be brought into the system ? #% Many in my constituency are now almost destitute . #% None of the potential solutions we currently have on paper are that elegant , but they get us through first reading and I am sure we will be getting back to that at the common position and second reading stages . #% This also means reopening the controversial nuclear power debate , which I support . #% Now those ideas , then so easily dismissed as crazy and impractical , are being given positive form . #% The background to this proposal suggests additional reasons for having this legislation . #% My use of the word ` atrocious ' shows this is patently untrue . #% I can not go back to my region tomorrow and tell my people that they do not need to worry , that we have a plan for 2020 . #% This will devastate those two market towns . #% Let me finally explain why I think issuer choice of regulatory authority is important . #% There was confusion in the markets about what was perceived as an unpredictable decision and the marketplace was clearly not prepared for that decision . #% IDABC is a means to an end , a means to interactive government services at a pan-European level and it is absolutely logical to want to extend this now to businesses and to citizens . #% We prefer generally not to accept amendments concerning the scope of the regulation , the benefits covered , the changes in the competent authority and so on . #% I would ask you to look at this matter urgently . #% We all want to see security and stability in the Caucasus and an end to the spiral of terrorism where we see endemic banditry and distorted nationalisms now fed by Islamic extremism . #% Can the Commissioner say when an opportunity for revising the directive to introduce these exceptions - supposing Parliament would ever agree to them - might arise , and does it feel that such an exception for animal waste and for the burning of empty pesticide containers in on-farm incinerators would in fact be likely to gain acceptance ? #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - It gives me the greatest pleasure , on behalf of the ALDE Group , to welcome both countries into the European Union . #% We have some models of good practice in our own countries to show how public services can be held accountable . #% Mr President , we like to claim that the EU is a Union of values based on democracy and the rule of law . #% We have had endless resolutions , endless debates , all of which have been trying to hide our helplessness in confronting what was going on in Yugoslavia . #% One is that there should be a proper database so that citizens can follow their petitions through the Internet . #% So this may be the last chance I have in plenary to say publicly from our side of the House that I very much enjoyed working with her . #% This is not a particularly controversial issue between the various sides of this House . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the Israeli Labour Party on entering into government . #% We have witnessed the assassination of two ministers and this week a bomb attack , presumably aimed against western forces . #% . -- Mr President , we must congratulate the people of China on the progress they have made since the death of the tyrant Mao Zedong 30 years ago . #% In Bangladesh restrictions on night work and overtime are being lifted . #% Commissioner Byrne , I am not noted usually for complimenting you on your good performance but on this occasion I wish to be fair . #% If you can not buy local , buy regional . #% In most of our countries , perhaps all , a minister who misleads parliament or who fails to take action to deal with grave mismanagement would step down . #% Mr President , I want to focus on one particular issue which I feel has not been fully explored . #% But the reference is to legally recognised organisations , NGOs , with which all of us are familiar . #% So we had this conference and Mrs Theato has produced an excellent report which my group supports as a follow-up to the initiative which you started and the conference we had . #% I speak now as one who has been a Member of the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee since 1994 and who has visited many times , seeing the significant advances , particularly in the fields of freedom of expression , justice , minorities and children . #% While I believe that my personal life has always been , and continues to be , rooted in love , I accept that it may cause genuine offence to my colleagues . #% When UN troops in Liberia stand accused of rape and torture , how can Europe launch its own ESDP mission in Aceh , Indonesia , without any human rights monitoring ? #% I hope , Madam President , you will help us in that endeavour . #% Madam President , I would query your ruling that the two amendments are compatible . #% There is also a need for adequate heavy equipment to deal with situations like this and even picks and shovels seem to be in short supply . #% Our populations need to know that influenza always has been a global disease , and nowadays , of course , there are additional means by which it can be spread . #% I am reassured by the Presidency remarks this morning on the need for equi-distance . #% This will be very welcome to those farmers whose livelihood has been very precarious over the last eight or nine months . #% We must ensure , however , that monitoring and enforcement procedures are included within the Convention . #% Now we are faced not with a health measure but with a single-market measure which threatens to omit 300 items on this list from the ` positive ' list of items available . #% That means only one thing : that China can not be held to be an appropriate host for these Games , especially since nothing has fundamentally changed since 2001 . #% Mrs Morgan , inevitably asks from the wilds of Wales ` Why were there not any Welsh people ? ' #% The boot-shaped country obtained two such appointments - the boot-shaped country obtained 4 A2 promotions in this period and the big island obtained 5 , of which , to the best of my knowledge , none came from Wales . #% If we are to continue to be an effective Budgetary Control Committee , this must continue in an unfettered way . #% Given the momentum of the Cardiff process and the fact that this is all beginning to happen now , it is going to be quite a lengthy process and is not going to happen overnight . #% But he must understand the feelings of this House . #% Our institutional overload , as we all know , is quite dramatic in the Union and with enlargement it will get worse . #% Clearly the British Government is acutely embarrassed and I find it shaming , as an Englishman , that the British Government is being so secretive in this case that it ordered the withdrawal of all British responses from the file the Commission released to Parliament . #% In fact , if you add Romania and Bulgaria , 18 ratifications will be in the bag by the end of next month . #% I say that because the deal was quite unique . #% I also call on the Commonwealth to suspend Zimbabwe from the forthcoming Commonwealth Games on 25 July in Manchester . #% These amendments reflect the old days and not the reality . #% 
Very briefly , the other points I would mention in respect of Russia are the situation in the Russian army , in particular in Chechnya , but also internally because the Russian army is notorious these days for the cruelty which it exerts and in particular the treatment of its young conscript soldiers . #% The main evidence for this is that Community waters did not attract foreign fishermen , while British waters most certainly did . #% BNFL were the ones who told the nuclear installations inspectorate and their customers what had happened . #% That is not to say that we do not understand the issues raised about the applicant countries and about small and medium-sized tobacco producers . #% So I think we should now take some time to cooperate and work together on moving forwards and towards a new long-term agreement as well . #% Attack on a train in Angola #% We do not subscribe to your project . #% I would emphasise also that if the MEP Statute comes in , as mentioned earlier , this would probably be embraced within it . #% You reassured us this morning in the Committee on Budgetary Control that the Commissioners will have responsibility , but there are still unanswered questions . #% It consists of two words from the Commissioner this afternoon : ` We accept . ' #% However , I failed to achieve a consensus amongst the political groups and , therefore , the report stands as it is . #% in writing . - I abstained in the final vote on this report because at a time of austerity across the European Union , it seems ridiculous to support projects such as the European House of History . #% The agreement also has wider implications for the post-Lomé negotiations , where the Commission and Council are strongly in favour of regional free-trade arrangements to replace Lomé-style preferences . #% This is why it was very important for the Purvis compromises to be included in the various articles mentioned during the vote . #% Whilst the ECR Group places great importance on equality between all people , we oppose further legislation at EU level ; we believe the gender equality issue is best driven at national level with the involvement of civil society within local communities . #% At the end of the day I agree with you , Commissioner , that 50 % co-financing between Member States and the Commission must be the way forward . #% That , in turn , implies using simplified procedures for the less important and the less controversial matters . #% It is a cause that my party has long championed and we say unreservedly to those who join us here today : you are most welcome . #% The amount that is being allocated is far too small in my view and does not add up in terms of achieving a doubling . #% In this period of time before Helsinki , it is vital that we look too at the rule of law , human rights , respect for minorities , protection and recognition of their cultural identity and support for measures seeking to abolish capital punishment , one of the amendments that came before our committee to the Morillon report this week . #% We do not know whether this is true . #% There is often no attempt at meaningful information or consultation in good time in avoiding or mitigating job losses . #% It informed us that Mr Barroso had enjoyed a cruise aboard a luxury yacht owned by Spiro Latsis , who has done business with the EU institutions for many years , and whose Lamda shipyards , just one month after this holiday , received the green light from the European Commission for a tenmillioneuro grant . #% India is the country with the second-highest level of infection after South Africa , and the biggest increase in infections is in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . #% At the same time , we ought to be using our influence with other Middle Eastern states , not least Iran and Syria , to get them to use their influence with fundamentalist groups in the Middle East to support the peace process and not undermine it because ultimately the victims of any efforts to undermine the peace process will be the Palestinians . #% It therefore seems very inconsistent to adopt this report , which seeks to pass measures and form opinions which will , to some extent , go against the measures we have already taken on public health grounds . #% Even the Prime Minister was talking about Baroness ` Ashdown ' as opposed to Ashton . #% However , it is a policy that tends to be set at the biannual ministerial meetings . #% Mr President , I welcome the fact that at long last we have resolved this issue of the European Company Statute . #% This means that we have to recognise the importance of funding for cultural activities . #% There is , however , a deficiency . #% Indeed in some places we have reports of ineffectual follow-up , in other words , even where people do report , nothing very much happens . #% That was not an isolated incident , and it is still happening today . #% As we have now gone past that date and there are still one or two Member States , in particular my own , where Parliament and the Commission have different offices and where in terms of financing Parliament 's office well over 70 % of the expenditure goes on bricks and salaries , it does not leave much for communications . #% He said : ` This Parliament brings together representatives of all of Europe 's main political parties . #% My party at home are certainly not racists , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well . #% Speaking personally , in terms of my work on corporate social responsibility in this Parliament - I am also speaking at the umbrella organisation of cooperatives across Europe at a conference in Paris next Monday - it is certainly true to say that cooperatives are leading the way in terms of socially responsible business practice and deserve the credit for doing so . #% Of course , this is not just a problem in Europe . #% All the Member States must go out and help those countries that have avian influenza at the moment , and I know the Commission is doing that . #% The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully . #% That said , in terms of overall content it is a good agreement . #% But it is the second level that interests me : to give information to our citizens on how to pursue cross-border litigation . #% It refers to the new powers of the Community over the last few years : rights of asylum , immigration and general cooperation in civil matters . #% That is why we need a balanced solution to financing agriculture which does not offload the costs onto the weakest . #% What is the Commissioner 's view of this report and the likelihood that a lack of progress could halt talks ? #% In the twelve months since the Prodi Commission adopted the Reform Strategy White Paper we have achieved significant advance in all those areas . #% Madam President , there seems to be a lack of correspondence between the different linguistic versions of Amendment No 118 . #% With these guidelines and with the Amsterdam mandate , we are seeking a coordinated action which is set out in the action plans , so that we can address the evaluation process on an ongoing basis . #% Imagine if each of our national governments had to go through a procedure whereby they had to fill in fifty pages of answers to a questionnaire and were subject to three hours of grilling and questioning in public before the national parliaments took a vote of confidence allowing them to take office . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs , who have done excellent work . #% The same amendment also demanded that the EU anthem be played at these matches . #% Delay in designing a practical strategy and in pursuing necessary modernisation would not have been acceptable to the Commission , to the Council , to this Parliament or to the public , as I am sure the honourable Member understands . #% Turning to other matters , the European Union is very good at giving lessons to others , but often fails to learn lessons itself . #% I think that is quite correct because if the Council - which I see is not yet here this evening - had been seriously interested in playing a part in becoming a party to this framework agreement , it could have done so . #% Unfortunately , the Niebler report fails to meet these criteria . #% In conclusion , we ought to look also at what we do with countries like , for example , Hong Kong - which I only mention because it is fresh in my mind - where the administration argues that money we give for support of human rights is actually political interference and refuses to allow us to spend that money . #% There is another issue that I want to raise . #% We have the right legal framework , but we have to make sure that the regulators do not intervene too soon or too harshly , and that they allow the creativity of the market to work . #% How patronising is that ? #% In fact , they are veritable oxymorons when used in relation to anything to do with the finances of the European Union . #% Such possibilities have arisen in the past , especially in relation to major infrastructure projects . #% I welcome the title of this document : ` boosting trust through action ' . #% Of course I welcome the dialogue between Pakistan and India , but we must not forget that the people of Kashmir are also stakeholders in this process . #% Governments can not micro-manage enterprise . #% There has been an attempt , both this year and in previous years , to include some strategic thinking and we welcome some of the recent innovations , such as the move towards more rigorous impact assessment procedures . #% The EU must continue targeting development aid to the poverty-stricken areas of Cambodia so that young women who escape have an actual alternative and are not lured back into the trade through desperation . #% 
Of course there is a cost to be considered , but I think Parliament believes that we should be working on the strategy with the Commission and the Council now and that , at the very least , we need a stated timetable on when each of the thematic strategies is going to come to us . #% Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular . #% In Britain alone , most of the banks , the insurance companies and even the National Health Service have outsourced . #% I would like to draw the presidency 's attention to the fact that the massacre is particularly serious because it included women and children . #% I am very satisfied that this Agency will do its work in such an objective manner that it will be able to cope with the extra burdens that will be put upon it by dealing with the issues that would otherwise be dealt with by a separate institute . #% We in the PSE felt , as I said earlier , that this was a report on the transportation of radioactive material and had nothing to do with the merits or demerits of the nuclear industry . #% The urgency now is for the European Union to play its part in providing humanitarian aid . #% We have to be careful . #% I sympathise at the loss Russia faces with the ending of the bilateral free trade agreements with the acceding EU states , but overall , the tariffs drop from 9 % to 4 % and Russia can not fail to extend the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements to the Baltic Republics because of disputes over ethnic Russian minority rights there . #% As he knows perfectly well , but is apparently seeking to hide , the Conservative Party 's position on the euro was supported by between 65 % and 70 % of the British people . #% People have spoken about zero tolerance . #% May I thank the President-in-Office in particular ; I have much enjoyed these exchanges over the recent weeks , taking place in a rather empty public library though , sometimes it may seem . #% We have asked for a report from the Commission regarding this which we are awaiting . #% We will immediately carry out thorough consultations with staff and staff representatives on all these documents in the months until mid-July . #% You are quite right to highlight the question about quality control and the whole question of screening . #% 2 ) We supported all reductions in the use of animal testing #% He is absolutely right to argue that the Commission is in a stronger position to take an impartial view which does not bend to accommodate specific national interests and therefore it is arguably more capable of drawing up adequate data-protection safeguards . #% We need a proper resource management discussion in this Parliament , and , particularly , we would like to see a coherent , effective and politically balanced Administration . #% Counterfeiting is a very serious issue for high-value , quality products , and is an issue we must address . #% The amendments that we have proposed fall into four main categories . #% The difference between the cost of the total remuneration of 600 officials before termination of service and the cost of the allowance they will receive afterwards will finance the recruitment of 258 new officials . #% So , for those who believe in multilateral trade rules , as we do , serious reform is not an option but a necessity . #% We have always enjoyed the charm with which he has introduced all his reports , and he has done the same again ! #% They just will not answer . #% The European Commission and Member States have expressed their concerns over these events , and have called upon the Vietnamese Government to resume the dialogue initiated earlier this year between the UBCV and important members of the Vietnamese administration , including the Prime Minister , to restore the hope of a solution acceptable to all parties . #% All of our institutions have a responsibility concerning the monitoring of EU law . #% Like most of that action plan , and based on ordinary single market principles , these directives too are based on the single passport system to enable insurance companies to sell across Europe , so long as they comply with their own home regulations . #% We do not need a supranational bureaucratic dictatorship to tell us how to look after our chickens . #% I want this afternoon to speak for those who can not speak for themselves . #% We have to be honest and realistic . #% We are not at all happy about the co-regulatory approach - whatever that may be - because we see that as a way of moving away from binding legal instruments , which can sideline democratic control . #% Everything we do has a global dimension . #% As we have seen on many other reports in the Fisheries Committee there has not been the political will among Member States to enforce it . #% We need to take this area of law outside the remit of a few specialists who may be able to charge a lot for it . #% Everyone accepts that the LTTE is a player , and yet the EU has effectively washed its hands of negotiations through its proscriptions . #% Britain led the world in the battle to abolish slavery , but the only Charter - actually so called - which we have ever had in Britain was signed at Runnymede by King John in 1215 . #% Another factory I worked in during my 30 years in the industry -- the Oxford plant of what was the British Motor Corporation -- is now one of the most successful car plants in England , which produces the Mini . #% We know of course that both the Belgian and German members of the European Union have at the very least put forward ministers from regional government from within their own country at Council meetings . #% There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile . #% However , I should like to register again my concern that we still need more information . #% And what has been done to resolve the problems of the much-needed EU patent because of the obsession with multilingualism in the institutions ? #% The Commissioner has made some commitment in this regard , but I am disappointed by the reluctance to incorporate much by way of amendment into the regulation itself . #% The European Conference potentially could be a powerful engine for deepening and widening the political dialogue and cooperation throughout the European continent . #% They identify as key factors sustainable development , quality food production , consumer safety , protection of the environment and biodiversity , animal welfare and rural development . #% Firstly , I find the whole anti-road sentiment of this report baffling in the extreme . #% I represent several such companies in my constituency and recognize the value of their work in developing pest resistant crops and seed varieties that are especially suited to particular climates and terrains . #% Therefore , we were prepared to accept , in the trialogue , 30 months after the implementation date as being the period before which tyres not meeting the requirements should be sold off . #% I appreciate that perhaps there has been some confusion about this report , and that it is simply a discussion paper . #% Once democracy is introduced , it is introduced . #% If the Council is not good enough to be here then we should finally reject it now . #% I am grateful for what the Commissioner says in terms of compliance by the British Government . #% We are very concerned about some of its activities and the way in which the Commission is dealing with it . #% According to the FAO , between 1981 and 1990 deforestation there reached an average of 600 , 000 hectares a year - an area larger than Costa Rica or Switzerland - double the rate of the 1970s . #% It does not appear on the Internet version any longer , but it was there on the version that was originally submitted to Parliament . #% I do not see why there is such a drama about this . #% Therefore we have had to abstain in the vote today on this report . #% The Commission will have to ensure that we achieve this and that it is available to everybody , and not just those living in urban areas . #% Parliaments decide legislation : that is a power we have to share with the Council of Ministers and we have no powers of legislative initiative . #% I hope this report will ensure that the European Commission finally starts to do what it can to help . #% These services are designed to help the relays provide their correspondents with quick and up-to-date responses to their questions on EU policies , programmes and funding opportunities . #% Thirdly , on external policies , we would like improved accountability . #% Equally , in terms of the special representatives , where we are recommending that the whole sum be transferred to the EU delegations , the point we are making on first reading is that we want to have , if not special treatment , at least clarity in the way in which these people are appointed . #% Mr President , I would like to contribute to the debate this evening on behalf of my colleague , Lord Inglewood , who is a victim of the famous deer incident which has extensively been referred to already . #% I hope that in amending this regulation Parliament can for once simplify rather than embellish and make the labelling of beef consumer - , butcher - and farmer-friendly . #% I have pointed out to you again and again that you have not been directly elected by the people and you therefore have no real legitimacy . #% In the fight for security from terrorism , we have rightly proclaimed that we are defending fundamental values but , if we compromise individual rights in the pursuit of security , we will have sacrificed some of what we hold so dear . #% 
If he was Italian there would be no dispute at all . #% Madam President , I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Dührkop , on an excellent report on the guidelines . #% The reality is that ferrets seem to have caused no particular problems . #% The whole model is in drastic need of revision . #% I mention his name because he is a very good example of what is happening in Burma . #% They play into Ariel Sharon 's hands . #% Pension funds are the prime source of capital , and I have advocated UK-style self-select pension plans for the self-employed being permitted to make such investments on a pan-European basis , although this was rejected in committee , unfortunately . #% Many of them , as those figures show , are children . #% Finally , since all Member States face the lamentable situation of increasing voter apathy - particularly amongst the young - the call for more young political engagement is most welcome . #% Unfortunately , although the two aims are compatible , there is some tension between them where the details of the regulation are concerned . #% But the Commission wants them to care , so it decides to spend millions of euros on propaganda -- for that is exactly what this is . #% We have had over a third of a million people move into Britain from countries like Poland in the last 20 months , and when Bulgaria and Romania join there will be another flood of migrants into Britain . #% Swiss citizens voted against this because they were not satisfied that choice in that sense would raise standards - it might just prove confusing . #% One example of such activities is a study into Russian institutional and regulatory requirements in combating money-laundering that will be launched later this year . #% Mr President , I also add my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Piecyk , for his excellent work . #% He has the nerve to say that he does not believe it will lead to further terrorist attacks . #% Of course we welcome President Obasanjo 's announcement of an inquiry . #% Promises must be kept and we must develop the early warning systems which , as we now know , are already available in the form of the underground testing systems based in Vienna . #% Therefore , we should not lift the arms embargo and we should continue to recognise Taiwan as an independent democratic State . #% It is in the spirit of that judgment that we must interpret Article 255 of the Treaty . #% When we agreed to the streamlining of the economic and employment guidelines last year , we implicitly agreed not to unpack the guidelines themselves until 2006 -- the mid-point . #% I am glad they were defeated . #% Just how much must Member States do to meet her requirements ? #% In the meantime there is much work for the EU to do to convince both sides of the Arab-Israeli problem that peace is the only real option available in the long term . #% Some of those countries have also embarked on a long-term process of democratic transition , openness and reform . #% One of my particular pleas is that we focus our attention where we really can help , which is on extending and encouraging research and development capability in the developing world . #% I will leave aside the feeding of carrion birds because I wish to look at a different form of carrion , that is the catering waste represented both by the recycled swill in some countries and by recycled cooking oils in others , including my own . #% We are deeply concerned about the economic crisis and its impact on the peoples of Malaysia and all south-east Asia , but we must continue to raise our voice against the flagrant abuse of fundamental political and human rights . #% I agree that it is right that all the institutions of the EU should observe the same standard norms , but I am still less convinced that such legal constraints need to be included in the Convention . #% He also touched on the challenge of terrorism . #% All Members have been presented with a great deal of conflicting factual information which has made reaching a judgement difficult . #% The opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , of which I was the draftsman , was unanimously carried and we are delighted to see that many of our recommendations have been endorsed by the two rapporteurs . #% As I have been war-wounded getting here and fallen over I shall expect a better answer than I got from the Commission yesterday . #% I very much regret this and will not support that amendment . #% A modest amount of promotion of Fair Trade would trigger a substantial growth in the market for Fair Trade goods and significant poverty reduction in producer countries . #% There is much to be welcomed in this report and the messages that it is trying to give and I would join others in congratulating Mr Menrad on the skill with which he has put his report together . #% - Mr President , I am all in favour of the labelling of beef . #% We hope that Parliament will give overwhelming endorsement to the report and we look to speedy progress towards an appropriate outcome . #% Finally , we ought to be able to say to the applicant countries : do as we do and not merely as we say . #% Their crime is that they refused to sign declarations denouncing His Holiness the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist . #% Given that the risk by land and air of infection is now so great , will you at least assure us that you will not rule out preventive vaccination , at least to give additional assistance in the attempt to stop the disease spreading , even if the animals have to be destroyed later ? #% Mr President , this is an important report on the Commission 's Green Paper on the statutory audit , and I wish to thank Mrs Sierra González for the completeness and thoroughness of her report . #% We are united in our view that it would be wrong to set up a pan-European supervisor now or in the medium term . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the Danish Presidency for being able to keep hold of the big picture and not allowing the summit to be side-tracked by arcane details and what are relatively small amounts of money . #% In some quarters a misplaced view has arisen that the WTO is a malign agent for all the negative effects of globalisation . #% The Development Committee is also extremely concerned with the imposition of a III ( a ) committee procedure by the Council . #% According to this report , you left the meeting and then briefed the press on Her Majesty 's political opinions . #% Together we have achieved a great deal . #% We strongly reject the claims concerning breaches of environmental legislation because the Environmental Agency has conducted its assessment and come to the conclusion that there was no environmental harm . #% They might as well all be in the pay of the drug barons , because the effect of their determination to pursue the policies of prohibition will simply be to line the pockets of those same criminals , discarding more intelligent approaches which could reduce the real harm to individuals and to the rest of society . #% Even more significant for European consumers will be the proposed non-discriminatory access to networks for different competitors . #% I agree about the importance of public services and the role that social security has to play within this . #% It is almost impossible to conceive of such a huge figure or to think about the social dislocation and misery that will cause . #% The Bureau , which was unanimous in its view , put forward a very humane request . #% I urge you to ensure that the Council and the Commission take a uniformly tough line on Zimbabwe before it is too late . #% Please do not expect us to approve what you might propose later in the summer without having had a full debate with our political groups . #% It is not her fault , we are delighted she came -- thank you for coming , Minister -- but would you please convey to President Borrell that this is a failure . #% Instead , we are bogged down in this interminable roundabout of discussion on procedure . #% Would the Commission please look into why the regulations on the proper disposal of PCBs and PCDs are not being correctly followed ? #% It appears to me that the US is , in fact , lashing out against everyone and everybody . #% We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call `` hard law '' . #% There has been a lot of comment about the pressure under which this debate is taking place . #% I hope that the Commission and the national governments will take note of the many excellent suggestions in this report and thus give a boost to the future prosperity of farming in the rural areas . #% If I may associate myself with Mrs Larive 's broader points , the Community prospers the greater the more it is a Community of law , rules and of predictability . #% Mr President , having sat through this debate , I have a message for the dockers gathered in Strasbourg . #% The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments . #% 
It has also been discussed recently in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly Social and Environmental Affairs Committee . #% Could I express surprise that the compromise package negotiated by the three largest groups has been rejected by the Council ? #% Mr President , as you will know , Mr van Hulten 's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and , since I want to make a comprehensive reply , particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control , I seek your indulgence . #% We need to get targets down to a level that countries can meet at some point in the future and work out how to get there . #% We therefore strongly support the centre-piece initiative of this Commission : the 2020 strategy . #% There is increasing intimidation and persecution of the press . #% We would certainly urge you to redouble those efforts in the weeks ahead . #% The international fight against terrorism inevitably overlaps with the question of combating weapons of mass destruction . #% But we must not commit a single fighting man until we are sure we have a peace agreement . #% We welcome the fact that in November the Council gave serious consideration to this issue of coffee dependency . #% Second , to adopt targets for renewables which are consistent with a reduction of between 30 to 40 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 . #% That is an extremely regrettable initiative . #% However I would also like to refer to the specific case of a constituent of mine , which provides a good example of the brutality of the present Burmese authorities . #% Commissioner , you talk of a political solution . #% I need only a short answer , just one word will do in any of the official languages . #% As a spokesman for my party and group on human rights issues outside the Union , I can say categorically that the ECR upholds and endorses principles of equality , tolerance and diversity everywhere . #% Here we need a simple procedure . #% Mr President , while my report welcomes the Commission 's communication , it is also constructively critical in a number of important respects . #% Perhaps the Commission would be able to enlighten us at the end of this debate because it would help guide the way in which we would vote . #% Either wages will have to go up sharply to meet the demand for more staff or the scheme will be bedevilled by labour shortages . #% Of course , we need full and independent information from all sides on all aspects , not just the effects on business . #% My first suggestion , addressed to the Commission - and I promise the Commission that this will be my last criticism of it - is that it would be most helpful in future if the Commission could contrive to produce its annual economic report and its broad economic guidelines in sufficient time for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment because these two projects are the joint responsibility of those two committees . #% There are nine other applicant countries - if I leave aside Cyprus and Malta where it is presumably easier to control the borders - so we have ten applicant countries , all with problems like this , without enough money to meet the cost . #% But I do have a definite problem with the process : a qualified majority vote without an indication of votes , no check of votes on the floor and absolutely no scrutiny of the process behind this . #% We do nothing to boost confidence among our electors by having silly stories as we have had in the United Kingdom this week about church organs , and the European Union 's intention under the WEEE Directive to ban church organ repairs and building because of the lead content . #% I do not just refer to the collapse of Barings Bank in London , following dealings on the Singapore market , but also to the consequences which followed lower interest rates in the United States in 1995 . #% European Governments will not accept the community method or qualified majority voting for CFSP , nor a Foreign Minister based wholly within the Commission . #% Therefore I would not like my vote and those of the others in my group who supported that amendment to be misconstrued . #% author . - Madam President , no one can deny the positive impact the European Arrest Warrant has had on cross-border crime . #% We are putting these in as preparatory actions to be approved under the 2007 budget . #% Remember the tsunami ? #% It is one thing talking about the operational standards of safety , the other important aspect is the regulation of the industry . #% What do the Member States themselves say ? #% They also have access to legal redress if appropriate . #% We have equal opportunities for car insurance now due to another lunatic judgment by the European Court , which means that even if young women could get a job , they could not afford to drive to it because they have just had their car insurance doubled . #% You can see this evening that there is opposition from various countries . #% It is essential that we maintain an education programme that will keep people from buying and eating great apes through greater understanding and awareness . #% in writing . - Given the state of the economic crisis which grips the European Union and which has a global reach , it was important for Parliament to find agreement . #% We must do more . #% Mr President , while totally condemning the policies pursued by Saddam Hussein and the appalling violations of human rights , particularly against his own people , can consideration now be given , firstly , at least to easing the embargo in a way that will provide more desperately needed supplies for the Iraqi people , while maintaining total opposition to the dictatorship and efforts of Saddam Hussein to build his military strength , and , secondly , to seek to help end the fratricidal struggle between the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions - the KDP , which has been cooperating with Turkish forces - and the PUK , which has been in league with Iran , which is undoubtedly playing into Saddam Hussein 's hands ? #% Despite all this , I do hope that the Swedish Presidency is able , in the time remaining to it , and indeed at the summit , to focus the attention of all European leaders on the major issues that concern the people - those issues they concentrated upon at the start of their Presidency regarding the economy , Europe and indeed climate change . #% Still unable to grasp the concept of the single market , such national authorities should be put to the test of Commissioner Monti 's single market scoreboard . #% The decision to grant discharge will be taken at a later date , when sufficient information has been provided . #% Yet if there is any reason for these committees , it is surely to have a two-way dialogue about coordination of aid . #% Mr President , on a point of order , firstly as Mr Schulz will well know , as he sees the lively debates in our group which go on in public and in private , we have already attracted one of his members , Mr Balfe , who is a member of our group now . #% British Airways , as I think you will agree , is a benchmark across the globe for high standards of airmanship . #% We do not need programmes on multiculturalism or multilingualism or any other ' - ism ' , that will happen anyway as students from around the world meet and mix on campus . #% These were not indiscriminate massacres : the paramilitaries had lists of names - in particular community activists and leaders - and executed the people on those lists . #% I know we have communications . #% But we need some clarification on some issues . #% I would agree with what Mr Robert Evans has said . #% What I am asking today is for the European Parliament to do what she asks . #% Accelerated environmental degradation over recent years has occurred as a direct result of the increase in resource consumption and economic activity generated under globalisation . #% Ratification and implementation of the relevant Council of Europe Convention is also essential . #% Perhaps the one good thing that could come out of President Bush 's unilateral introduction of tariffs on steel imports would be a much-needed serious debate about the flaws and weaknesses inherent in the free-trade model , because there is growing opposition to the global inequality inherent in its diktat that every country must put international competitiveness above all other domestic concerns . #% Many Members of this House and members of the Committee on Budgets will think that with Parliament 's acceptance of the Kellett-Bowman report on matters relating to satellite agencies , the matter has been done and dusted . #% Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for the statement . #% Presidential elections will be held there on 9 March and time is running out . #% I contend that this Parliament has failed and that it is the leaders of the four big groups who are in fact the guilty parties in this matter . #% Therefore , we must maintain the arms embargo imposed by the EU . #% Coming straight after the report of Mr Hughes , earlier today , suggesting a number of amendments to the proposed extension of the working time directive to mobile workers , one thing is very clear . #% We should be looking to achieve best value for our citizens and a transparent process for those tendering . #% If we are to have some competence , albeit limited , in the criminal field , this must be balanced by measuring that legislation against something fundamental and basic that guarantees our citizens ' human rights . #% It is about adding to European Union competences , taking forward the political ambition of European integration and empowerment . #% I do not think that the discharge report or resolution or debate is the right arena for commenting on the procedures used by the Court in producing this certificate . #% As he said , much of the debate which happens within the Council is filtering out in the form of discussion within the monthly bulletin , but this is not the same as a regular report with a formal framework in which it is discussed . #% 
Presently , we have a precarious situation whereby the EU is reliant on these two countries ' systems which could potentially be called into use for military purposes at any point . #% With regard to the two amendments , my Group , whilst it supports the spirit of what Mr Lannoye proposes in Amendment No 1 , would not go as far as this to write the precautionary principle itself into this particular directive . #% It is good to see Commissioner Andor here this morning , but it is a pity , in a way , that Commissioner Špidla is not here . #% The idea of constructive abstention and more majority voting within commonly agreed strategies is a new way of moving forward . #% Parliament has given a lot in trying to get an agreement at the Convention and the Council also claims that it has done the same . #% I hope Parliament will give its support to the proposals in this report and the compromises agreed between the political parties , and that we play our part in achieving what could be another success story for the European environment . #% If animals are to survive , they do so because we allow them to do so , because there is no economic incentive to kill them or because we actively want them to survive . #% There is no reasonable alternative , and at times it is the only link to the mainland for such essential needs as hospital appointments , education and business . #% I therefore welcome in particular the emphasis which Mr Alyssandrakis has given to this in his report and appreciate the amendments he has tabled to strengthen these aspects still further . #% The multilateral trading system is a most just and effective way of expanding and managing trade and it shields the weak from the use and abuse in the unilateral scramble for trade domination . #% I would urge that the Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Rights Ombudsman be given jurisdiction over their activities . #% In this particular case , quite a lot of important work has been done by the Commission in incorporating and simplifying three texts related to life insurance . #% We are seriously concerned that , for example , the French inquiry report will not be published or made available to the public and indeed , the deliberations of the channel tunnel safety authority will , not necessarily be made fully available , in particular all the background papers that related to the approval of the semiopen wagons which played a key role in causing and spreading the fire . #% Please vote in favour . #% The EU Foreign Ministers must demand that they do this before Burma is allowed to sit down with them in Hanoi . #% This is an important step forward for consumers . #% I wish to start by discussing paragraph 49 on Kashmir . #% The fact that a man who admires General Pinochet , called Mormons scum and filth , promised to shoot criminals and describes himself as a semi-democrat is regarded as a moderate nationalist in the Russian political firmament , shows the worrying drift of politics in Russia . #% I would ask Commissioner Patten , if he is still listening , whether or not he agrees with me that this reinforces the need for an effective European Foreign Security Policy and European Defence Policy where we would be capable of taking autonomous action - not to be independent , but rather to protect our security from being blown around constantly in the winds of US domestic policies and US presidential elections . #% However , it would be wrong to accept this free trade agreement - and we have heard many people speak on it - at face value , and there are areas which need further clarification by the Commission . #% In Sweden , as in any other Member State , or democratic society , caution must be exercised in making a declaration about anyone who has been acquitted of a particular charge that could imply defamation of that person . #% The vote in the Industry Committee was a reasonable and proper one . #% But the truth about numbers can be unpopular , especially here , which is why we hate them . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , Gloria Arroyo 's succession to the Philippines Presidency after former President Estrada 's impeachment trial on corruption charges , and her eventual election in May 2004 , have brought some improvements to the country , particularly in terms of security . #% As a criterion for membership of the Union , is respect for minority languages and cultures being seriously independently monitored and if so by whom and how ? #% His report consisted of voluntary targets for businesses . #% I welcome the emphasis on bolstering research and development in Europe , on developing content industries and on speeding up broad-band networks with all that is involved as part of working towards a knowledge society . #% I know the Council prefers to do things by consensus but in order to achieve something of real substance -- a real change -- should the Presidency not push this to a vote at the next General Affairs Council and name and shame Member States that do not support this position ? #% I support the call from the rapporteur with regard to an economic impact assessment of this legislation before the second reading . #% I ask your support for the amendments I have mentioned . #% They are not represented on the Council or the Commission so how is it that they can be involved and possibly veto any changes ? #% Let us have a peace for all Sri Lankans , based on citizens ' rights , humanity and in which government resources are directed at building communities , not helping to destroy them . #% What he was advocating was an EU-wide fiscal policy , which would result in EU-wide higher taxes . #% I have a document here in front of me stating that the British government admits that it was unable to meet the required deadlines for the slaughter of infected animals . #% I am sure they would not do this very often , but it would allow them now to save face and go home with an acceptable solution . #% From that point of view what we need in the context of the new single currency is an understanding that in activating the pact for stability and growth we do not strangle investment in either the private or public sectors . #% That will enable us to give proper scrutiny and proper control of the budget . #% But I also believe that the European Union needs a dedicated programme of democratic engagement in the region , and I look forward to hearing from the Commissioner what her plans are in that regard . #% Nigeria must understand that its relationship with the civilised world will not remain the same if the sentence is carried out and I for one will advocate expulsion from the Commonwealth and an immediate programme of selective sanctions and travel bans on Nigeria 's leaders . #% There are real problems there . #% The reality is that all the large manufacturers are using every trick in the book to prevent consumers getting a fair deal , at the same time undermining the need to improve energy efficiency , which is a crucial element in protecting the environment . #% I could tell this House every month about cases involving more job losses than we are talking about today : companies that need to restructure , companies that are working in a global market . #% Mr President , I believe the euro will electrify Europe , and these three reports demonstrate why . #% I do not want to deal with a retrospective view but to look to the future , as Fernand Herman said . #% The observatory itself : EUR 215,000 ; Eurostat : EUR 250,000 ; Member States ' statistical services : EUR 350,000 . #% For many in my political group , and maybe across the Parliament , to start full negotiations with a country when you do not even know what your existing financial capacity is -- to run a union for 25 countries in this way -- would be extraordinarily inept and irresponsible , because we need to know what the basis will be when we are negotiating with a country of that size . #% All you will achieve is to isolate yourself and the Palestinian people further . #% Mr President-in-Office , you and I agree on the goals of trying to inform the European public , not just in Brussels but everywhere , of what we are doing . #% There was one particular one that caught my fancy , which I thought I might like to buy . #% What evidence does the Commission have to support this argument ? #% Government spending is only some 20 % of GDP , whereas in the eurozone it was 47.5 % in 2005 . #% One of which I am aware of is ocean thermal energy conversion that uses the temperature difference between the cold bottom waters of the tropics and the warm surface waters . #% Let us see more of that type of work and not this shopping list of disconnected proposals . #% Labour Euro MPs have been at the forefront of protecting our citizens and our environment . #% It would be perverse for Britain to go from a position of transparency to one of relative secrecy . #% In December Mr Colom i Naval , who is the rapporteur on the financial perspectives , presented a working document in the Committee on Budgets on the appraisal of the financial perspectives from their inception in 1988 to 2002 . #% I want the Chinese to listen to the words of my colleagues and to this resolution on religious freedom . #% It is , after all , one of my own country ' s most distinguished universities . #% But , alas , I have to talk about the hot topic of the day , which is , of course , the City of Strasbourg . #% I ask for a report to be brought forward to show the state of law in each member country and the state of legal practice . #% When we now look at the enlargement of the Union , all kinds of problems will arise if we allow ourselves now to move towards a centralised system which allows only by prescription use of such medicines as are currently administered by qualified persons in countries like the UK . #% I thank you for the acknowledgement that you have made already of the very important meeting that we had with the chairman and the chief executive of the British Association of Ski Instructors . #% He mentioned the crucial factor of how technology is now enabling those services to be transformed and new models of organisation and delivery to be sustained . #% This is totally unsatisfactory as far as we in Parliament are concerned and for the budget for 1997 we have put the payment for this year on hold until some progress has been made . #% Council , you have the chance to get us out of this ridiculous situation and thereby enhance the Union in the eyes of its citizens . #% We recognise that more may be necessary . #% 
But there have been many previous examples of this approach in previous and existing Treaties . #% I particularly welcome Amendment No 10 because it will place a limit on the way in which champagne-style bottles can be used . #% Why am I so concerned about this ? #% It found itself in our pigeon-holes today and it was there for debate with the human rights forum which the President referred to . #% That is not what this question is about and it is not what my letter to Mrs Gradin was about , but he is a democrat and he will understand . #% This was a time , let us not forget , of great euroscepticism -- the buzzword in those days was eurosclerosis -- and when governments were telling us not to change the Treaties as it would only lead to a step backwards . #% To emphasise the problem of distance , it takes a friend from the Shetland Islands a 14-hour journey by car and ferry to reach the nearest cinema . #% I fully support this report , therefore , which aims to lift the financial burden for paying for increased security that airports and airlines currently face . #% I wonder what affinity there is between the British Conservatives and the bulk of the PPE on this fundamental question . #% People were really upset by the illogicality of the situation : mountains , hills and footpaths were closed for no reason . #% I support the cautious approach which the Commissioner has taken and is taking in this matter , firstly because this is not a simple issue . #% Some of the other comments were not necessary , and that is why we voted against quite a few paragraphs within this report . #% We must , we should and we will . #% It is quite unacceptable that the Council still has not endorsed the recommendations of the Goldstone report . #% Where is this in a country-of-origin regime ? #% It also points out that the continuance of subsidies to the tobacco sector will put a heavier burden on the EU budget after enlargement , and that something should be done to do away with the total mismatch between health and agricultural policies within the EU . #% Modernisation instead of marginalisation of partnership requires the US to open its defence markets and us , in Europe , to coordinate where possible . #% I particularly remember a woman talking about the problems of internal migrants in China . #% Simple renditions of illegal combatant terrorist suspects through EU territory are a proven fact , but not necessarily illegal under international law where torture is not involved . #% If we adopt this proposal and pass this amendment , we will be walking away from the opportunity to create the right environment so that people can really benefit from the immense power of the new communications world . #% Mr President , I am sure that the House overwhelmingly supports the statement you have made . #% Mr President , Commissioner , there are many endangered stocks world-wide . #% We need to know where the facilities are that will save the lives of citizens of our Union when they need them . #% That is what this report aims to do . #% However , in fashioning this partnership , I hope the High Representative will give due weight to avoiding duplication of effort and thereby the wasting of taxpayers ' money at a time of austerity . #% If the UN is not capable of seeing this through , the whole multilateral element of international politics would be discredited and the world would become a much more dangerous place . #% However , there are negative aspects . #% In conclusion , I urge this House to support Mr Perry 's amended report and , until the due process has been exhausted , go no further . #% I received it by e-mail from Mr Kinnock ' s office , but as far as I can tell it has not yet been officially distributed to Members . #% A directive has legal force and we feel that is what is needed . #% When it is based on a Constitution that confers powers on the European Union with the agreement of every single Member State on the ratification of treaties ? #% In this regard , the JAR-OPS 1 Regulation constitutes a good basis from which we can work , with minimum changes , in order to amend the appropriate regulations . #% That is really what we are discussing here . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur , Gerhard Schmid , and other colleagues on the committee . #% My constituents in Northumberland , Tyne and Wear , Durham and Cleveland demand that the Commission put an end to the culture of casual misappropriation of taxpayers ' money that exists in so many of our European institutions . #% But let us kill off once and for all this idea that Europe is a Christian project only . #% I fear that Mr Schmitt did not understand this truth and has somehow misled Members of his group . #% Next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period . #% Yet , as we begin to learn the lessons of , say , the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the UK , it is quite clear that one of the reasons that disease spread so far and so fast was precisely because of the closure of local slaughterhouses . #% The Commission will remain as the unelected government of the EU , formulating and dictating laws without any democratic mandate whatsoever . #% I say to my friends in Portugal -- and many of them will be speaking shortly about these issues : come and talk to those of us who have lived through that problem before . #% I also understand quite well the first answer . #% Many organisations , individuals , groups , associations and communities that are eligible for structural funds fail to receive their fair share because of the over-complexity of the application process . #% The Commission has made progress but we need more - and soon . #% In Objective II , let us be clear that giving help to the poorest regions is not the same as giving help to the poorest people . #% Madam President , while I welcome many of the improvements that have been made , I want to make a point concerning the management side : we would very much welcome some recycling facilities , given the sheer amount of paper that appears every day , much of which is not kept . #% One of our problems is not only that the Commission does not produce impact assessments , but that the Member States are not honest about their capacity to put in place what they sign up to . #% That is why the Greens are supporting very strongly this resolution from the Environment Committee . #% in writing . - Criminal justice is rightly the responsibility of EU Member States . #% On the fiscal measures currently being envisaged by Member States , it is important to continue with sensible , balanced approaches which also do not add up to protectionism . #% And if we can make it work , then I hope that American business will be attracted and the whole political climate across the globe will change . #% We do not want to make that mistake again , and I believe that in this situation we want to know how we are proceeding . #% On the operation of the CSFP in 1997 , it is fair to note that there have been a number of successes including democratic consolidation in central and eastern Europe . #% I suggest his conclusions are wrong because his analysis is wrong . #% I have some doubts about that and I really wonder whether this is our priority in Europe . #% Despite the best efforts of the rapporteur , there will still be those who will seek to get around it and to look at every way to carry on with their dirty dealings . #% I want to see more work from the Commission showing us how that money is being properly and correctly applied and what the positive outcomes are . #% And at a recent voting session with Mr Mauro in the chair , he said that one amendment was rejected , when in fact it was adopted by 584 votes to 41 . #% Senegal provides us with an example of the dangers , of what can happen when we take a narrow view of fishing agreements . #% Like others speaking in this debate , I believe that further crises in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region can only be averted by refocusing the debate on a just peace between Israel and the Palestinian people . #% Once again , we see the confusion and incompetence of the EU in practice . #% Let me say to you : the reception that we got from those decent , ordinary people confirmed to me that your two parties do not represent those decent ordinary men and women of Poland ! #% Mr Barroso , as I said at the outset , says that he wants to boost employment in the EU . #% Europe is culturally richer for having Muslim citizens and residents , and I welcome that . #% We found it particularly bizarre that Green Members of this House and Green campaigners rejected talks on the environment within the WTO , in the name of the developing countries . #% This means allowing some effects of the slowdown on the deficit , but certainly not all . #% 
There is , as I have already said , absolutely no evidence that there is any reduction in safety or security as a result , and to establish an entirely spurious linkage , whereby we wait until we have a perfect scheme for taxation before we attempt to make some progress in the area of opening up and liberalising asset management seems to me to be very unfortunate . #% Who can rule the Ivory Coast ? #% Like Mr Brejc , Mr Lax , and others , I myself have adopted that approach . #% I therefore have two demands to make of the Commission . #% That would mean a substantial decrease for the old EU-15 . #% Our next debate will be on economic partnership agreements and one of the most contentious issues for us , and which we will raise , will be the financing of aid for trade in the economic partnership agreements . #% We should encourage firms to use them and enforce them properly . #% We had launched the Lisbon Strategy , but without enough conviction or commitment ; unsurprisingly , it has not succeeded . #% Arrested for taking part in demonstrations , banned from teaching , sent for re-education and now imprisoned for seeking to exercise freedom of expression , the Chinese called Liu Xiaobo a criminal whilst the rest of the world awards him the accolade for peace . #% Human rights seem to have been taking up quite a lot of time , and quite right too . #% Yes , Israel must allow the investigation of what happened in Jenin to take place , provided that investigation is fair and balanced and takes a view which is objective to all sides . #% Thirdly , we are asking the Commission to look at the compensation regime so that local and regional authorities are not left short-changed . #% Mr Wiebenga 's report is based on a Commission proposal in line with the Tampere conclusions and the scoreboard . #% During recent negotiations on the economic partnership agreements , many Members right across the political spectrum were concerned about the Commission 's one-size-fits-all approach to the EPAs . #% I now turn to Mr Stenmarck 's report . #% That was not to be . #% Is it a new service which should not be covered by European telephony or broadcast regulation but treated like a new service such as Internet shopping ? #% What then should we do ? #% Indeed , we could say that the internal market will function only if we have a coherent system of civil justice . #% This is a sign of what the EU can achieve when we are determined to set off down a particular road and not let obstacles hinder us . #% Therefore it is academic . #% This report seeks a balance between the need for adequate preparation in both those fields . #% For the past few years I have tabled amendments for various reasons to postpone or not sign off the Commission 's and Parliament 's accounts . #% This Directive no longer has crime prevention as a goal . #% I agree with Mr Barroso that the Presidency must make efforts to reach an outcome at the December Council . #% However , as I intimated , I do have a number of concerns about the way these regulations have been framed . #% The EU has already contributed substantially , but we must do more , much more , and so should the rest of the international community . #% in writing . - I and my ECR Group colleagues agree with much of this report , including improving budgetary efficiency , simplifying the application procedures for EU funds , as well as prioritising the completion of the 2020 strategy . #% Finally , as far as the legal base is concerned , we support the proposal that the directive should be based on Articles 175 and 95 . #% We do not need more complexity . #% Transport costs should be paid by the user , but governments should not charge rural users if there is no public transport , and this report makes that very clear . #% That is not what the taxpayers and consumers of Europe want . #% We also want it to be a duty for the committee assisting the Commission to consult with other organisations . #% Whilst we can not predict with certainty the extent to which temperatures will rise , we can be certain that the risk of abrupt climate change exists . #% Someone who once lived under the cloud of discrimination said : I have a dream . #% Nowhere in here does it say that the IMF is there to support political experiments and , in so many ways , that is what Dominique Strauss-Kahn did . #% As the rapporteur has said , this will enable us not just to learn from lessons but prevent problems occurring in the first place . #% Mr President , I am not sure that the Commission fully understands what is at issue here , and I would just like to make it absolutely clear to Mrs Cresson . #% In conclusion , I accept that non-state actor involvement is not simply - nor principally - an issue of funding . #% I wish to conclude with a note of thanks to my colleague on the committee , especially to our chairman who I know feels as passionately as I do about this area of law , whatever our differences , but my biggest set of thanks must go to the committee secretariat and to Mr Robert Bray for all his help and advice throughout this process . #% It is beyond belief that in many countries you need a licence to own a shotgun but not to trade in weapons of any type . #% That mandate awarded in 1996 did not , however , include market access issues such as traffic rights and capacity , which are plainly vital for the purposes of any successful comprehensive air services agreement . #% Only then will we as a European Parliament sanction the sort of reconstruction effort that Commissioner van den Broek has indicated . #% I would therefore like to add my voice to the recommendation and add a request for the Commission to report back to us on proposals for safeguards to be applied when any building question arises . #% My own government is concerned to ensure that our efforts to facilitate freedom of movement for legitimate EU nationals do not open new channels that could be exploited by criminal gangs and others . #% We have 245 pages of roll-call votes , and it seems that the smaller the group the more roll-call votes it wants . #% I am at a loss as to why out-going President Kim of South Korea is so flattering about his Pyongyang counterpart . #% Dr Mondragon , giving evidence in this Parliament earlier this month , showed that the fumigation of 22,000 hectares of illegal crops last year in Colombia did not prevent 38,000 hectares of new cultivation because the problem is one of no alternative for the peasant farmers . #% Right from the outset we demanded an open vote in every parliamentary committee in order to allow MEPs to register their opinion on individual EU Commissioners . #% I welcome Commissioner Kinnock 's statement , but he knows as well as we do that it has come far too late and it really should not have been necessary . #% In comparison with a similar sized economy such as France , the United Kingdom already contributes disproportionately to the EU budget and that is after Margaret Thatcher 's rebate . #% I share the concerns that countries are helped and encouraged to maintain their cultures . #% It is an anomaly . #% Indeed in March of this year , the Council in Lisbon sought further progress , progress which I am sure we would all endorse . #% Will we be permitting the Third World countries to have some kind of meaningful representation so that we hear their voices as clearly as we hear the voices of our own fishing people ? #% I have always supported the security fence on the basis that it has saved human lives from the evil of suicide bombers . #% How do we get there ? #% When you consider that , of the 175 countries in the world on the UN index of human development , both Ethiopia and Eritrea are in the bottom five , and that this conflict will lead not only to much greater poverty in both countries but to far greater instability in the entire region , we have to call on both countries to pull back from the brink of war and engage in talks . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer and I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker for bringing this forward . #% In the case of buildings , it is important that we control leakage , and inspection and control of leakages are included in the Commission 's proposal , which we support . #% However , there is no way that we can support some of the amendments . #% It is often said that the citizens of our Member States do not understand Europe , and , if they did , it would be more popular . #% I had submitted a question to the Council on the legislative process and the way in which this House is potentially being treated in relation to the proposed directive on legal aid . #% He has brought economic growth to Russia at a time of very great danger in the economic system of that country . #% That work programme must be agreed with the various policy committees . #% But let us not kid ourselves that we share values with this fundamentalist and medieval regime . #% 
This issue has been the most contentious with Council . #% The European Union has invested in the world 's largest research network and we are already seeing it spread worldwide . #% If we are honest , and I agree with Mr Medina Ortega about this , we know that whatever we do may not bring a resolution to the many personal cases of loss . #% The wishes and needs of the Iraqi people should be paramount . #% Madam President , I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders . #% I think what we have , at the end of the day , is a reasonable compromise . #% It is going to be under scrutiny , so best practice is all-important . #% Like a number of other countries with co-existing Muslim and Christian communities , such as Pakistan , Indonesia and Egypt , there have been periodic clashes . #% The Commission has moved , in large measure , to implement what we in the temporary committee recommended . #% Again , it is extraordinary that a basic requirement like using fire-fighting equipment or life rafts is not checked annually . #% There have been many improvements which we have noticed , not least the very helpful guides who are around to help us when we get lost . #% This is a point which will not be lost on those MEPs who deplore the waste of time , money and energy caused by the failure to locate Parliament permanently in Brussels . #% I am sure the Commission would agree that this alternative approach to solving the power needs of East and Central Europe , as opposed to a nuclear programme , is the one that we should pursue . #% There has not been widespread corruption as was feared . #% Firstly , tyre standards are not the only problem . #% I want to be quite consistent about my position , speaking as leader of the British Conservatives in the European Parliament . #% Mr President , I am interested in the number of roll call votes we have been having on this report . #% Europe can not be built upon mathematical equations , but on political trust . #% The answer to that is ` no ' . #% I would like to thank the Council for working so closely with us and also to thank my colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee who worked very closely with me in making suggestions . #% Mr Zappalà has been the main driver on this issue , but it has been a pleasure to work with many colleagues . #% I can tell you that the people of Essex and other parts of the east of England that I represent would like less interference in their lives by the European Union . #% It had ten years to prepare and produce proposals on the operation of derogations on the opt-out and annualisation ; the review and communication were clearly required by November 2003 and yet , incredibly , the Commission still managed to miss the deadline . #% Before I make my points to the rapporteur , I would ask you to deduct the 38 seconds I have just spoken for . #% Madam President , I would like to begin my contribution by paying tribute to the many very brave men and women in Albania who have risked their lives and their livelihood in order to try to preserve peace , order and decency in that country . #% We are also pleased to see that this report contains a commitment for second-pillar provision , that it should be available without discrimination on grounds of age , gender and work contract . #% It is not in this report . #% We shall listen to the arguments that are being put forward in this debate and then review our position again , but our group is leaning towards accepting Amendment No 14 from the PPE-DE Group , the first half of Amendment No 15 from the Verts/ALE Group , and possibly Amendment No 16 from the Verts/ALE Group . #% Action in this field is urgent . #% I hope that Commissioner de Silguy will press this point when he meets the Finance Ministers to discuss the conclusions of the European Parliament 's report and the Commission 's text . #% Europe can and should follow suit . #% They want safety assessment that is neither conducted behind the closed doors of the Commission nor tainted by producer or pressure group interest . #% Mr President , for the railways the status quo is really not an option . #% However , by abstaining on the final vote we are making a statement that we feel that the final text is insufficiently clear on the question of differentiation . #% One final point , not mentioned in the report I have to say , is that some of the countries involved are countries where the financial systems are not as strong as they should be - I will say no more . #% The years 1999 to 2009 are the African Decade of Disabled People , set up by the African Union . #% I hope tonight and tomorrow the Commission listens to the vote of this House and decides to proceed with its commitment to have a directive on safer car fronts . #% I have to say that in the United Kingdom in the past we too have had difficulties in maintaining the right prison regime for those convicted or detained for terrorist offences . #% Could I ask if the presidency would not agree to any further extension beyond the period which currently operates in Britain ? #% Secondly , is the system coherent and efficient ? #% We often say ` red tape ' when what we mean is that we do not want to stop people from doing something that they should not . #% This is why we were calling earlier today for the second part of that report to be available to us so we have as much information available to us when we come to the hearings in early September for the incoming Commission . #% I would say to the people of Slovakia that nuclear energy may in many respects be a clean form of energy but it is one that allows no room for any mistakes at all . #% I hope that such a positive stance will be maintained by the House and by the administration which serves the House . #% It is an interesting point . #% Every year since then we have had to use the flexibility instrument . #% We accept that they have the potential to be a force for good in Nigeria , but they must accept greater responsibility in response to the latest crisis . #% We will need to opt for the Commission proposal of EUR 5.5 billion in total or move towards the Council which is proposing a somewhat lower figure . #% They have voted against measures to make certain that we are absolutely clear that people do not abuse the asylum system for terrorist purposes . #% And even where there is state failure or where the state collects insufficient revenue to provide these services , they do not believe that non-state players should be allowed to fill in the gap . #% That has been the level of the contribution that the Council has made to our procedures . #% The Committee on Transport and Tourism were keen to ensure that in dealing with individual agreements with individual sovereign countries , Parliament used the same procedures and guidelines for rapporteurs to work with in order to give us a consistent approach and to give us the opportunity to consider important aspects , including relevant safety and social conditions . #% Resources are scarce and the last thing we need is two different sets of capability goals . #% We need to find more research money to make coal more environmentally friendly and more economically competitive . #% I am concerned about the potential for over-elaborate administrative requirements : too many people being involved in the certification and eligibility procedures . #% I share with her the belief that the relevant timescale is from now until the Kyoto Conference . #% That is what we should aim for . #% This is the bedrock of the European Union . #% It will be about many countries that will now be Member States and the neighbours will be different . #% Instead , I urge the Commission to concentrate on delivering the economic reform agenda . #% The Development Committee can not and will not be duped by what we see as double-speak on this issue . #% We British would like to know the United Kingdom 's real contribution to the common agricultural budget when considering the cost of BSE eradication in Britain and the cost of compensation to farmers because of the revaluation of the green pound in the light of the Thatcher-negotiated refund . #% I appreciate she may not have been briefed on this , so if she does not know the answer perhaps she would be kind enough to write to me in such a way that we can publish it for our colleagues . #% But we do not manage very well with 15 countries at the moment . #% While this resolution is very much about human health , we have to remember that we have to control avian influenza in the world . #% When Parliament drew up its original report on the Socrates programme , of which I was co-author along with Mrs Pack and Mr Verde i Aldea , we had very high hopes of this programme . #% 
What we have now seen is the same set of arguments that perhaps they were trying to avoid : a consumer panic and protection of a market - a market which is actually now much more imperilled by the way in which the crisis has unfolded . #% It states with regard to Parliament resolutions on COS documents that , of the 490 requests we made last year , the Commission has decided not to follow up 104 cases . #% I can accept that Member States need to cooperate in trans-national matters related to criminal justice but I do not accept the development of an EU criminal justice area . #% Any attempt here would be presumptuous as to that review 's outcome . #% Last year I went to see the Pakistan Ambassador to the European Union and raised with him a number of cases . #% I hope that this will be sooner rather than later . #% It is a disgrace from the US to China , from Central Asia to Central Africa . #% So , what I would say , finally , is that we in this Parliament urge all the creditors to stop delaying and to start working really hard towards fulfilling full debt cancellation for the poorest countries . #% The Congolese victims of sexual violence include women , men and boys who have also suffered rape , sexual humiliation and genital mutilation . #% In paragraph 12 the rapporteur sets out a long list of extra administrative tasks for the Commission in making reports , and I would suggest that we must beware of criticizing procedures for being complex and bureaucratic and then in the next breath calling for more of the same ourselves . #% Mr President , I would like to highlight briefly some other points that we make . #% In response to the question originally tabled by Mr Collins , public access to the building was considered to be an important aspect of urban integration during the design phase of the Berlaymont renovation project . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by welcoming the report and certainly the intention behind the Commission 's concern to see action in this matter . #% I very much hope that the European Union will support this initiative firmly and in a very committed way . #% The UK is to benefit from increased squid quota around South Georgia . #% Many of the penalties which courts impose on their own citizens are not easy to apply to citizens of other countries . #% He will also be aware that there is a great deal of misleading publicity and scaremongering on the part of what is generally referred to as the dutyfree lobby . #% The use of a similar name to ride on the back of another product , which may have been established on the market for 20 or 30 years , is an unfair business practice , and outlawing it in the way that the amended directive has done is an eminently sensible thing to do . #% I am proud to be the rapporteur of this report because , in my view , it clearly demonstrates that , regardless of differing political views on Europe , its future role and so on , there are many areas like this where we can work together in friendly and effective cooperation , in a way that makes a real practical difference to many people : both those who are dependent on our care and those who have to implement our rules and regulations . #% Mr President , yesterday evening you announced to Parliament that the Council was not going to be present after 7 p.m. tomorrow evening . #% Mr President , I think we would all agree that , if we are to run the Community properly , we need a high-quality statistical base within the Community and the applicant countries . #% Before the vote on Amendment No 10 : #% The Parliament has an agreed position in favour of simpler rules and procedures , and it makes no sense for a technical , legal regulation to do the work of Country Strategy Papers and National Indicative Programmes . #% This may have been because they had other meetings , or whatever , but it is a gross discourtesy for people to walk out when the Prime Minister is speaking . #% In Britain , because of EU state aid restrictions , we are rapidly losing the Royal Mail postal service , to the detriment of consumers , particularly in remote areas . #% However , we can not expect the travelling public to have to foot the bill yet again . #% It needs to be very simple and effective and , above all , free of charge to those who have boats at the moment . #% If we hear now that other national associations are expressing concern , I ask : were they given the full facts at the time ? #% But what makes this attempt particularly sinister is that it is being sold under the beguiling and wholly misleading claim that the reform is - I quote from the session ' s news briefing - `` to free hard-pressed Commission staff in the Competition Policy Department from routine matters to enable them to concentrate on major cases of non-competitive behaviour '' . #% Bill shock was not good for the reputation of the mobile operators but more importantly , bill shock was not good for consumers . #% Added to these developments , the Legal Affairs Committee had an historic joint meeting with national parliamentarians , this morning , to discuss the EU legislative process and how Community law is implemented . #% I understand that they are the ones that have to tell passengers what their rights are , but in various instances , with Air France in particular , we are told that it is not up to the airline operator . #% However , I think the Americans will take us slightly less seriously if they read carefully Mr Souchet 's resolution , particularly paragraphs 10 , 11 and 14 thereof which refer to a bit of legislation of which I had not previously heard called the Amato-Kennedy act . #% Finally , our commitment is to fund human and social development in the world 's poorest countries . #% Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group I welcome this proposal and many of the amendments tabled by colleagues , and those tabled by the rapporteur who has already worked very hard to find a sensible way forward on this . #% I also want to acknowledge good progress made with the common agricultural policy and , in particular , the IAC system , which has given great benefit as well . #% The European citizen will feel truly privileged that we have such a grand praesidium to service our work . #% However , as Mr Marinho has pointed out , more is necessary , but that has to wait for the IGC , #% It is all very well to say that there is no past incompatibility . #% The price , if we are to reoccupy the Berlaymont , has to be satisfactory ; the quality has to be acceptable ; there have to be legal guarantees ; and these are preconditions for our eventual reoccupation of the Berlaymont . #% I was told recently that in the United Kingdom there are some 40 000 fewer places available in care homes today than ten years ago . #% Later , there is even a hint of a repeal . #% Nor is it appropriate , in my view , to refer to the EU undertaking peace-restoring missions as distinct from peacekeeping and peacemaking operations . #% I quote from The Independent where seven prominent Danish scientists , who actually study as a professional interest the releases of radioactivity from Sellafield , said on 12 May : `` There is no scientific basis for the claim that the present release of radioactivity from Sellafield causes an unacceptable contamination in the North Atlantic and Arctic regions '' . #% Many of my constituents in the United Kingdom are writing to protest against this German law banning certain breeds of dogs which appear to pose no threat to public safety . #% I suspect the manufacturers of some large expensive cars would do that rather than spend money on re-engineering . #% Although some amendments that capture a number of our concerns were adopted , many others were not , and much of the report continues to give very uncritical support to ever greater economic integration . #% Ukraine now has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitments to free , fair and transparent elections as part of the European community of nations , where it truly belongs . #% in writing . - I welcome the report on bus and coach passenger rights as it is an important step in providing greater protection to travellers , as well as in increasing the comfort and ease of disabled passengers . #% What we now have to do is try to salvage something from it . #% I am , of course , in favour of measures that would genuinely enhance security . #% We will not immediately be looking to remove HFCs from fire-fighting uses , where they are clearly very useful and the alternatives are , in my opinion , not yet proven . #% The final selection of candidates is made by the portfolio Commissioner , by myself as the Commissioner for Personnel Administration , and the President . #% Can the Commissioner state whether the cost of what is being proposed has been discussed in the Council and what , for example , the Belgians have said about it ? #% What we want here , in considering these three reports , is an acknowledgement that the world has changed utterly in the wake of the BSE crisis . #% I also would like to thank Mrs Smet , our rapporteur , for the excellent work that she has done throughout this entire process . #% I know the United States is helping Spain in its current difficulties . #% What we would like to do is catch the imagination of Europe 's citizens . #% In the early days the European Parliament was perhaps dominant , but reliant all too often on separate House votes ; whereas the ACP was a bit more on the defensive , often represented by ambassadors or delegations of only government parties . #% Our resolution is important in terms of wanting to continue and support the work , in terms of tolerance and mutual understanding . #% Iraq is in just that condition today . #% It will fit neatly alongside the complementary legislation -- IPPC , Seveso , and landfill -- and make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment , human health and sustainable development . #% If these changes to the report are supported by the House today , I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living , not by giving a hand-out but by giving a `` hand-up '' . #% A TB vaccine is being similarly investigated elsewhere by others . #% In essence , we have created a preferential system for European motor accident claims and therefore , logically , it makes sense to give those who experience an accident in a purely national context the same advantages . #% I just wish to reinforce the view - and I am sure you would agree , Mr President - that what we have agreed is the position . #% 
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether . #% We doubt the new Palestinian Authority 's wish to build bridges of confidence and cooperation , yet we overlook Israel 's continued construction of the separation barrier . #% In spite of this , the Council 's message that is now being sent to the Burmese dictatorship is that it is an acceptable and welcome member of the international community , irrespective of its oppressive activities . #% Are his services looking at both of those insurance undertakings to satisfy themselves that in those respects the British Government has been properly applying European insurance directives ? #% For too long international human rights instruments have failed to recognise disabled people explicitly and UN agencies working in the field of human rights and development cooperation have not recognised the specific factors which exclude and isolate disabled people . #% In your original proposal you said that spam equals unsolicited e-mails . #% Criticism of past mistakes is certainly important . #% Mr President , we are referring to the working of the works council directive up to the period 1996 , i.e. before the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland signed up to that agreement . #% Financing for this project has always been a contentious issue : its financial underpinning must inevitably come from the private sector , but the ensuing relationship between the Joint Undertaking and the private sector must be carefully defined . #% We have to make sure that global regulation does not compromise Europe 's market strength in the type of vehicles that most world consumers want to buy . #% It is also absolutely essential to start the progress of this through the Council . #% Of course , we hear stories now of Swedes going to Spain on holiday and falling like flies from salmonella food poisoning because they are not used to the constant exposure . #% Data protection has also not always been subject to on-site evaluations . ' #% That has meant that we have managed to keep amendments to the minimum and thereby kept the cohesion of this report . #% in writing . - I condemn unreservedly the ill-treatment of people in Cuba ( or anywhere else ) . #% I think -- and I have never heard anybody suggest otherwise -- that British airmanship is the best in the world , even the Americans concede that . #% The industry has everything to gain from using its considerable resources to advance alternative testing , and not for expensive campaigns of procrastination . #% In Brussels , you are the Commission 's man . #% First , what will Mrs Reding be doing to bring the players ' associations on board and , secondly , are there any particular problems that she thinks we could resolve as far as the players are concerned ? #% I commend Mr Costa 's report , his work and , above all , his ability to bring us all together in a single common objective of trying to tackle the transport crisis . #% The British still seem intimidated by the success of the EU and have sought , at the IGC , to reduce the scope and force of common policies in the area of fundamental rights , freedom , security and justice , and in the common foreign security and defence policies . #% The final point I wish to make is that , of all the areas of this support that I dislike , the continuation in Amendment No 17 of the support for very low-quality tobacco is the most wrong . #% Indeed , I heard the President of the Council say this morning that in future we will have anti-terrorism clauses in those agreements . #% We are entering the new technological age , and again can I congratulate the Commission and also the Portuguese Presidency on the work that it has done to usher in the technological and informational age . #% Of course , if there was a codecision phase , it is perfectly logical that it would take longer . #% Finally , what is the SVC 's opinion of the various methods of disposal used in the UK where a million animals have now been culled ? #% From Mr Pirker 's contribution , you will see that Mrs Gál has had to do an enormous amount of work in her own Group and I congratulate her on the work she has done to bring people together . #% The Government of Sudan continues to ignore efforts at mediation , including from the UN Secretary-General . #% The Universal Declaration states that the rights to an adequate standard of life , housing , medical care , social security , education and employment are also human rights . #% But the laws of our Member States by and large accept that there is a difference between an embryo , a fertilised egg and an adult or child who is already a human being . #% Looking at this report , the phrase that stands out is ` best value for money ' . #% Firstly , old sites do not necessarily need to be cleaned up . #% I find I have been congratulated from many quarters , which makes me a little nervous . #% The industry has known about radioactive contamination in transport to the UK and France since 1980 . #% When I feed a dog and it bites me then I will not feed it any more because otherwise it may bite me again . #% Alongside the recommendations of low-floor buses , buses which in effect kneel at the kerbside to give easier access , many other safety features are contained in this report . #% Mr President , I give far greater weight to the pleas of doctors for the health of their patients than to those of tobacco companies trying to justify their deliberate targeting of their advertising to attract new young customers to an addictive substance to replace the hundreds of thousands of customers they kill every year . #% Competition in this context will deliver a good deal for the consumer , as it has in so many other areas . #% The report I am submitting to the House , together with my colleague , Mrs Mann , shows that we have many good ideas , but we have perhaps not paid sufficient attention to what we should be doing . #% I can not imagine the ordeal suffered by those children . #% The distinction between journeys for slaughter and for other purposes is an important one . #% Mr President , we all understand the difficulty and the complexity surrounding the WTO negotiations and we support the Commissioner and his team . #% Sometimes we may need to go for the status quo , but we need a more dynamic process than we have had so far . #% We were given a mandate by this House in January to look at this issue of restructuring in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% This week , in what I would say is a landmark ruling by the European Ombudsman , he has said that constitutes maladministration by EUROSTAT and by the European Commission . #% Of course , I agree with all my colleagues , the poorest countries who fulfil the criteria of delivering debt relief to those countries that show a commitment to social sector and human development support . #% We want his rhetoric of recent days to be matched by real leadership and real action . #% Mr Wynn , you commented that the Commission proposal is not based on assessments , it is based on availability . #% I believe she has left without having to declare who has been the more difficult , but I am sure that both of us , and hopefully all of us in the committee and this House , would wish her well in her new life back home . #% I will confine my remarks to the Esclopé report . #% Member States will still be able to sanction their companies to take anti-bid measures with the approval of only the board and not of the shareholders . #% Surely even Mr Chichester and his colleagues in the PPE must accept that when the regional employers ' organizations complain about the way in which these funds are being allocated then even they must listen to what is being said . #% The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April . #% I have heard the words ` freedom , liberty and justice ' bandied around in this debate . #% As parents and fellow human beings , let us mourn those who died and express our absolute solidarity with their families : their suffering is our suffering . #% We funked it that day two-and-a-half years ago , and we have regularly funked it since . #% The new rule , however , leaves no option but to vote against certain reports . #% We welcome the fact that they are continuing their moratorium on missile tests until 2004 . #% That crucial point alone demonstrates that these proposals are a political fudge . #% It should also be possible to take legal action as a preventive measure in order to put an end to unfair commercial behaviour , which - were it allowed to continue - might be detrimental to consumer interests . #% The reason for that is that the alternatives were found to be so toxic that they killed the vital zooplankton that feed on algae and phytoplankton in naturally balanced fresh water . #% They are the first step towards finding collective parliamentary institutions to work with collective governmental and administrative developments such as ASEM . #% The UK government has acted at all times in accordance with the wishes of the Council . #% I would like to ask him about the last part of his first answer to us when he told us that there was some thinking going on in respect of children and the IGC . #% I thought we were talking about the management directions and the reason we were asking for these directions to come in was because money was going missing . #% If I may return a compliment to him that he paid me earlier this evening , every parliament needs an Andrew Duff . #% 
I could not believe I was hearing it : I have to say that this proposal from the Commission is one of the most bizarre and ludicrous ever to come out of a body which is celebrated for its bizarre and ludicrous proposals . #% I simply endorse the rapporteurs call to include our Mediterranean neighbours , our Islamic neighbours ; we must cooperate with the Islamic countries . #% I hope that Mr Crowley 's report , on which I congratulate him , will contribute to this process and that the pace of progress to build a social Europe will gather momentum in Amsterdam next month . #% Only the big manufacturers who produce a wide range of engines can benefit from this . #% However , we reject the notion that improvements should be carried out under the competence of the Commission . #% To misquote Neil Armstrong : it may not be a giant leap for mankind , but it is an important first step . #% Mr Blair , will you agree with me that meaningful reform of the EU will require radical renegotiations of the Treaties , including the Treaty of Rome ? #% We believe in liberty and the rights of individuals to live their lives free from fear of persecution and prejudice . #% Mr President , I just wish to say briefly that I realize Commissioner Bangemann could not give a clear response to my request regarding the transatlantic summit meeting . #% I thank the rapporteur for his evident hard work in compiling this comprehensive report , for the cooperative attitude he has demonstrated throughout and his support for the inclusion of Kashmir . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , the English version of paragraph 40 should apply . #% Had he been part of the inquiry here in the European Parliament , he would have found that was not the case . #% The so-called historian , David Irving , has lost his libel case against the American academic , Deborah Lipstadt , who accused him of manipulating evidence to deny the Nazi genocide of the Jews . #% Our task is to clarify and to amend responsibly and on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Schörling , on the work she has done and the consultation she has had with us . #% I should be grateful if the Commissioner would spell out to what extent the delay is going to be detrimental to Galileo 's success in the international market for satellite navigation . #% Furthermore , Internet connections are often not personal . #% We have been much impressed , angered and even moved by those speaking to us and the financial and emotional losses they are experiencing . #% The Luxembourg Presidency , the United Kingdom Presidency and the future Austrian Presidency need to get together as a troika with Parliament early in the New Year as is planned , to make sure that we can continue in this spirit of cooperation because there are a lot of gaps between Parliament and the Council that still need to be bridged , especially on things like legal bases , on classification , the fisheries sector , and revenue . #% I believe in this meat labelling scheme . #% Hardly an example of giving value for money to the British taxpayer ! #% So I seek your support this morning on this very serious matter . #% Mr Brown also points to the rigidities , inflexibilities and lack of competitiveness of the rest of Europe compared to the more flexible and open economy of Britain , precisely because we have control of our own taxes and currency . #% It was widely reported in the British press that she only just survived the end of the meeting . #% The EU says it is committed to reforming the World Trade Organisation but a first place to start would be to reform the decision-making machinery of the EU itself . #% The recent report of Amnesty International of 27 March 1997 details ` disappearances ' , illegal arrests , ill-treatment , beatings and torture of those detained and death sentences imposed on the basis of evidence open to challenge . #% The reinsurance market now has no barriers to trade and it will have a strong supervisory framework across Member States when this directive goes through . #% But I believe that it wants to engage with us and we have re-established a recent history of engagement with Pakistan , which I understand is progressing reasonably successfully . #% I hope that rather than change a word , we should delete the whole of preamble D because it is tendentious nonsense which holds this Parliament up to ridicule with the rest of the world . #% It is quite clear from the experience in the fifteen still separate markets that strong regulatory bodies help market access for smaller players , protect the interests of consumers and force the pace of large monopoly-providers which might otherwise feel free to take a more leisurely pace . #% Only three Member States of the previous EU of 15 admitted their workers without restriction : Ireland , Sweden and the United Kingdom . #% When there is budget support , including MDG budget contracts , specific objectives and indicators on children must and should be included . #% They will not tolerate the far-reaching implications for social policies with lower wages , lower employment protection , weak social standards , reduced public services and the imposition of higher retirement ages . #% Can I ask if you are serious ? #% We must find some way of having a dialogue between the institutions over the next 12 months to make sure that these reforms take place and that we have the right kind of criteria for making sure that we are getting value for money from the staff . #% Let the producers and the promoters and their armies of lawyers and apologists also ponder for a moment their shame , their deceit and the destruction they have caused . #% Fourthly , we do not like procedure 3 and especially procedure 3b which can lead to blockages . #% We should heed the words of the leader of the opposition in Zimbabwe . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Madam President , the position of this group has been consistent throughout ; my position as rapporteur has been consistent ever since 2002 when we first proposed the inclusion of self-employed and independent drivers . #% I am grateful to him for reminding us that any prolongation of duty-free would require unanimity and I sense that unanimity is not likely to be forthcoming . #% I just wondered what your position is on the sale of arms . #% How much more effective that will be when the EU has control of national mapping services . #% Europe 's growth potential would suffer even more than it already has and , as a result , the recovery would be extremely slow and a large share of the current unemployed would become long-term unemployed . #% I think it is a step forward , based on a broad consensus , which now has to be implemented . #% I am very worried to hear you say that there is a likelihood that our observers will pull out because that will send a very serious message to the people of Cambodia who are clearly going through very difficult times . #% Greece needs our support and encouragement but asking foreign taxpayers , especially in countries outside the eurozone , to pick up the bill is difficult . #% I ask my colleagues in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality to get back to basics and do what is right for women . #% The Commission has produced a strategy which is good in its political , financial and management content , and it has avoided what we sometimes call in my country ` end-of-term-itis ' . #% Mr President , we have not discussed it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , but my personal view is that we should not accept urgency now . #% Will these people migrate , some to Europe adding to our 20 million unemployed , or will they take to crops like cocaine that will grow on the former banana plantations ? #% This really is a dilemma for Parliament and for the Commission . #% We must keep the pressure up to make sure that the momentum that was established in Doha is maintained in the years ahead and we will certainly strive to do so . #% The Council of Ministers betrayed him because of a lack of political will . #% Can the Commissioner give any idea of dates when possibly cattle could again be exported from BSEfree herds in the United Kingdom ? #% We , I am proud to say , reacted fast . #% Secondly , should not she and the NLD actually be offered basic freedoms before we are prepared to embrace the SPDC in this way ? #% Would he accept , as the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development does not , that vaccinated animals can carry the virus ? #% It should be noted that pharmaceuticals are a world leader in the European Union and represent a considerable amount of wealth in this Union . #% I should like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate . #% I can assure the House that the Commission and the Member States have repeatedly urged the Vietnamese Government to respect political and religious freedoms and strengthen economic and social freedoms . #% Indeed I welcome the abolition of the primary purpose rule by the UK 's new Labour Government , which will very much assist in cases such as this . #% We welcome President Khatami 's intervention , the action of lecturers and students in protesting and Dr Aghajari 's own appeal for calm . #% It is quite extraordinary that the Council has only finally spoken out now , and spoken in such muted terms . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the accession of the EU to the ECHR has been a long time coming . #% It is not in the best interests of the House , particularly when debating the Ford report on lobbyists , for accusations of this nature to be made by a Member of this House . #% Please tell me , why is it that my Government has taken that stance ? #% Mr President , I welcome this report not only because of its strong emphasis on the need for respect for human rights in China , but also because it echoes a key finding from my own report on EU economic relations with China , namely that the challenges posed by Chinese competition are not limited to individual sectors like textiles or footwear , but are in fact systemic in nature and require a much more comprehensive approach . #% 
By voting against this amendment UKIP was seeking to restore the commission position , hence retaining opt-outs . #% I hope the presidency will show exactly that political leadership on this issue . #% It seems to me that the Commission figures are aspirational . #% I fear , Commissioner , that you and I one way or another are on a stage with animals the whole time ! #% Second , whistleblowers must not only have their rights vigorously defended , they must be encouraged to come forward . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the proposal before us of course precedes the Treaty being brought into force . #% It has , regrettably , truncated communities , but it does not constitute the final border of a future Palestinian state . #% We deplore the line that Mr Hernandez Mollar and his colleague have put forward . #% Secondly , on the point about annual health checks , I understand that all staff of the European institutions are required to have annual health checks . #% And so a properly designed and effective appraisal system , which we have asked you a number of questions about in the question we have tabled , is also linked very strongly to that move , and indeed it is the very foundation of a linear career structure as well . #% I am pleased to be working alongside the London-based , internationally renowned , human rights NGO Global Witness in this endeavour , in which the US Administration is leading the way with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act . #% Europe 's farmers , food manufacturers and supermarkets should be adapting to meet that demand . #% They are broke . #% These proposals are anything but fair and efficient , especially as far as road transport is concerned . #% Now I note that the committee believes itself to be tackling pollution from leisure machinery which , it claims , accounts for a considerable proportion of the output of ozone precursors , especially on Saturday afternoons in the summer months . #% It means that as legislators in the European Parliament we are often legislating blind . #% In a distinct way , despite the desperate situation , he has a unique opportunity even now to deliver power to the people of Pakistan , the true custodians of that power . #% It was made in the EU . #% I wonder if you , Mr President , would write to send fraternal greetings and to say that this Parliament looks forward to establishing direct contact with it at an appropriate time . #% In my own region - and particularly in Cornwall , which is an Objective 1 area - we have very many small and medium enterprises that will find it most difficult to comply with this legislation . #% The Commission guidelines for Interreg definitely state that particular attention needs to be paid to ultra-peripheral and insular regions . #% But there is no justification for a Europe-wide standard on this issue . #% At present , revenue is not earmarked for transport infrastructure . #% These are the raw ingredients that we have to work with . #% Timing is critical in this . #% They voted for a party list and Mr Newton Dunn represented himself as fully in support of the Conservative Party , its leader and its European policy . #% We support the main thrust of this report . #% We are being far too prescriptive . #% This document is worth voting for , but it would be more worthwhile voting for if it contained a few more of Parliament 's amendments . #% I revert to the point I made earlier this evening that we are now talking about fisheries partnership agreements in which both sides acquire rights but also take on obligations . #% Only recently it has been revealed in the United Kingdom that there are hundreds , even thousands , of young children who have been sold into the slave trade from other parts of the world and are now in Europe suffering the most appalling treatment . #% Therefore , in looking at the market-opening regulations , we have to look at methods of competition and encourage competition between the different parts and elements of the platforms . #% Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations , which seems to go in a different direction . #% It is time to make black boxes a mandatory requirement on all ferries and high-speed craft in the interests of passenger safety and confidence . #% All we are getting here is more centralisation at the same time as more expansion to make an unworkable whole , and this in the very week that Germany has been told to get its economic house in order ! #% The EU established a ` Cooperation and Verification Mechanism ' to assist Bulgaria and to verify progress against six benchmarks . #% I think we have had a very good understanding and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them . #% However , we know from the Council of Ministers that voting by consensus , in other words by unanimity , is slower and more difficult than voting by majority . #% In celebrating her diamond jubilee , Queen Elizabeth came to my region , the East Midlands , where in their place of worship in Leicester , she talked to Sikhs , all wearing the kirpan , standing as close to them as you are to your colleagues . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights is quite unanimous that this common position is not in the interests of parliamentary democracy or transparency and it is not democratic . #% Furthermore , I recently heard that Afghanistan has no plans to abrogate the Sharia Criminal Code , including stoning to death for adultery . #% Many of the compromises that have been negotiated I am happy now to support . #% In Britain in particular we have a farming industry which is in desperate straits and wants to see some assistance given to certain sectors of agriculture : shifting money for agriculture from one part of the budget to another at this stage would be to give them a wrong message . #% It is regrettable that the UK is opting out of this measure . #% In particular , the dropping of the 1 000 m2 threshold which was proposed initially by Parliament in its report on the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency , and also the step of bringing in near-zero energy buildings by 2021 . #% We moved away from that a number of years ago . #% We should not forget how remarkable it is that China and Europe have found themselves able to reach such a compromise under immense pressure , but the first tentative steps must be taken immediately before the situation worsens . #% Commissioner Nielson 's communication gives us the opportunity to do just that . #% To the Commissioner , I repeat our private discussions that , whilst it is absolutely right for her to put conditions on European aid to the Palestinian Authority , I ask her to develop plans to avoid a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories if Hamas does not move as quickly as we all hope . #% Italy , after all , did not stop Slovenia joining in spite of border and minority disputes at the time . #% Today we know this emperor has no clothes . #% It smacks of Soviet-style planning that we should start now to think of what financing will be like in 2013 . #% I believe that this action , which only talks about several hundred kidnappings a year , is simply inadequate in the United Nations . #% I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of all the BBC management and staff and to journalists , trade unions in Britain and worldwide who have led the campaign for Alan 's release . #% Tourism is Europe 's and the world 's biggest industry , yet here in Europe we have lost 10 % of market share since 1960 . #% If they can act under Article 9 , as she said , will she not talk to them so that they can act more quickly ? #% If this Parliament truly represented the wishes of the people , it would throw this directive out , but it will not . #% A third of a million jobs in 1970 throughout the EU , today barely 100 , 000 . #% Much as I have enjoyed over the last years attending Hague Conference meetings as a sort of ad hoc representative of this House , we now need something much more formal and transparent that reflects the new role of our institutions in this process . #% I think that before Mr Dupuis gets so excited and starts making such exaggerated accusations he should first verify what has actually happened . #% We need in this report and in this Parliament to reiterate the importance of continuing this emphasis on tackling these particular diseases in the context of our poverty eradication efforts . #% There are , therefore , some key questions to be answered , including the level of duties , based on injury , that the Commissioner has found : 19.4 % for China and 16.8 % for Vietnam . #% Every situation is distinct and calls for different measures . #% Certainly they now accept them and the democratic norms which exist in the EU . #% Under its action plan , Tunisia has signed up to commitments in the area of democracy , good governance and human rights . #% Finally , perhaps this report will at some time enable us in this Chamber and in the Union to have a rational and reasonable debate on immigration and visa issues , decoupled from the ugliness of nationalism and xenophobia . #% 
A split vote has been requested on recital C from our side , but looking at the voting papers , I think that a word may have been included that should not have been . #% I believe it is ironic and tragic that the two countries who talk most about encouraging democracy in the Middle East -- the United Kingdom and the United States -- should be the very countries who left their posts in Jericho yesterday . #% It is important that we protect children with learning disabilities , whose mental age is often much lower than their physical age . #% Dublin is very nice but it is not the right way to go . #% This brings me to paragraph 6 of the resolution that calls for the Commission to have observer status at the Bank and for it to attend and intervene at certain councils . #% Yet the international community , with certain exceptions , seems to have been taken by surprise by the way in which this tragedy has unfolded . #% That is not a threat , it is just a comment to the Council , which it should bear in mind as we go through this procedure . #% I would also demand a full debate in plenary before the Commission and Council to draw some conclusions from these reports . #% Subnational authorities therefore already have an important role to play , both in the application of European legislation - for instance much of our environmental legislation imposes requirements on local authorities to deal with packaging and waste - and even , in some cases , in the transposition of directives into domestic legislation , as is the situation in Belgium , for example . #% I very much welcome the proposals in Mr Hallam 's resolution recommending the maintenance of maximum stability in the run-up to the introduction of the Euro . #% Let us not forget either that the Commission and Council turned down the idea of a separate new financial instrument to give support to neighbouring countries which need to adjust themselves to the new framework resulting from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement . #% This Union is an Orwellian creation where words mean the opposite of what is said . #% What he can not do is to confuse the two . #% I merely want to refer to a couple of paragraphs in Mrs Dührkop Dührkop 's excellent report and underline them , in particular recital D where she emphasizes that what we have to concentrate on in the budget procedure is the whole question of the collection of revenues so as to avoid wastage . #% Britain is already well on the way to achieving its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20 % by 2010 . #% As an MEP , I wish to represent the best interests , economically and environmentally , of my constituents . #% The other day I went to speak at a school in Coventry and I said to the children : ` You know where that Blockbuster video store and that supermarket are ? #% Can I correct the record and say that all political groups and all rapporteurs have been invited to all meetings . #% It would be easy to say that companies are resistant to change . #% The ECR therefore abstained . #% He used the IMF to help bail out the failing euro project and , as such , he was a very poor choice of candidate . #% In addition , the Commission ' s joint research centre should examine ways in which more effective warning might be given of seismic activity . #% How on earth are we going to explain that back home ? #% The Marshall Plan was worth USD 13.4 billion over four years in 1948 . #% So although I agree with much of Mr Andersson 's report , I disagree with the fact that we should have binding legislation and that is why we have called for the split vote . #% But this was not registered in the Minutes . #% He has failed to disarm militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad and seems incapable of stopping the rampant corruption that , in part , led to a Hamas victory . #% Beslan must not be exploited for political ends , whether in the Kremlin or here in the European Union . #% The EPLP also regrets that the report did not more closely acknowledge the link between actions taken in managing plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea and the scope of the cod recovery plan . #% I also want to add my voice to those who deplore the reduced funding for the area concerned . #% - This report confirms our worst fears about the intentions of some people in relation to the Charter and that is why we have voted against it . #% What they are doing is now entering a similar system -- they just call it pooled sovereignty . #% I hereby beg you not to vote for the rapporteur 's position on this and to go back to the common position and vote for Amendment No 11 and against Amendments Nos 2 , 4 , 12 and 9 . #% Recital p and paragraph 34 deal with the plight of domestic servants in my own country and a number of others . #% That statement from the Commission was quite appalling . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply which is in support of the position of the Commission . #% Yesterday several of them challenged the famous clause , which permits the steady development of the Constitution and of a decrease in the number of exceptional , non-normal decision-making procedures . #% They deserve that attention because they not only achieve positive outcomes for our citizens but also , increasingly , involve making political choices and balancing interests . #% The arrest and imprisonment of HADEP leaders like Sakharov prize-winner Leyla Zana and human rights campaigner Akin Birdal is an impediment to Turkey 's progress to the EU . #% Others want to listen only to those who said ` Yes ' in the 18 countries which have ratified the Constitutional Treaty . #% Is it worth us losing all of these things in the name of the war on terror and in the name of pushing yet more of our law-making ability towards the European Union ? #% In your relations with Member States , are you going to be a man or a mouse ? #% I invite everyone to read and consider the further action programme , all 121 pages of it , and to consider what has happened . #% We have never said the negotiations should be suspended in the middle of a process . #% It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports , a series of details . #% In direct contrast , the President of our Parliament made a remarkable speech in Lisbon which amounted to a virulent and vituperative attack on multinational companies , on liberal economics , on free markets and on the very heart of western capitalism . #% We know from Morocco what despair this has aroused among local fishermen as they see immense damage being done to their fish stocks , simply to provide European markets with sardines and other common species on which their own livelihoods depend . #% . -- Mr President , the Court of Auditors recently remarked that 90 % of EU activity is open to fraud . #% They should not be allowed to create monopolistic arrangements for air-time providers . #% Without an increase in defence spending that would be unacceptable to our electors , Europe 's armed forces can not mount and maintain any major operation outside the immediate area . #% The competitiveness , or rather , the declining competitiveness of the European Union is the biggest challenge that we are facing . #% But resolved it must be , one way or the other . #% Perhaps I could risk some superficiality , because of the time , by trying to answer the specific questions raised . #% All this leads me to think that we need a bit more time . #% It has inflicted incredible damage on the ecology of the North Sea and has done absolutely nothing for conservation . #% Finally , I have to add to a list of objections that is by no means complete the fact that , as we have learned to expect from EU legislation , the system is highly bureaucratic , adding massive overheads and a totally unnecessary burden on industry . #% Then there is the question of animal waste to herbivores . #% We need to address the too heavy and bureaucratic involvement of the Commission and we should accept the tried and trusted international arrangements used by the CLC and IOPC funds . #% President Mandela is approaching the end of his presidency after showing courage and unrelenting determination to ensure a better future for South Africans . #% So if there is blame to be laid in that regard , it should be laid fairly and squarely at the door of the Council . #% Lloyd 's therefore requested written confirmation within seven days that this citizen would desist from taking any further action in breach of the settlement agreement . #% In conclusion , whilst I appreciate the good intentions , we need to look at this more carefully to make sure that we do not once again come up against the law of unintended consequences . #% We can not understand why we can not be observers at that process . #% A concept that was developed in the European Union context by this Parliament when it prepared the Spinelli draft treaty on European Union is now actually used by opponents of European Union , who allege that the European Union is becoming over-centralized , that there is a danger of a centralized superstate . #% The second issue regarding cement was the risks of long-term exposure . #% I would have thought this is a very poor choice . #% 
It was brought to me by the Latvian Ambassador who visited last week and who tells me that they are still dependent on the old Soviet Union - Russia now - for their vote . #% Several of my colleagues and I have been to Calais and seen what goes on there . #% So we share that objective . #% Our Socialist and Democrat Group believes that the accession talks are threatened , not by a train crash , but by death through strangulation . #% There is also a further difficulty when we use soft or alternative methods to do with justice and access to justice . #% We are well aware of the importance that Denmark itself attaches to the work of the social partners in that 80 % of Danish workers are covered by collective agreements , but we are also aware that , as we have been hearing , a number of Member States do not share this view . #% I welcome the Commissioner 's statement that we shall return to the WTO panel if necessary . #% I particularly welcome two important features of this agreement . #% We had a very comprehensive impact assessment which clearly identified the areas which needed to be changed . #% We want to see a greater proportion of the taxation and the social security systems reserves transferred into active labour market policies . #% There will be a single foreign minister to speak for the Union to the outside world , instead of the Commission speaking on some issues and the High Representative of the Council on others , which meant that third countries never knew whom they had to deal with . #% I would like to ask : are not both developing countries and some small companies who depend on imported cotton being disadvantaged very considerably ? #% He said he could not comment on the European Convention on Human Rights but I think we are also talking about the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% The conciliation process that takes place in November each year is a real conciliation . #% This measure takes us a long way towards genuine and full liberalisation and I congratulate the rapporteur and the Commissioner on their efforts in this regard . #% I hope some amendments which have come from our side of the committee will give further reassurance in this matter . #% I thank the Minister for his genuine and honest statement . #% But education is important and we must make sure it gets the attention it deserves . #% This is a great improvement and we should remember that . #% I realise that he wanted to stick to the original Commission proposal of 2009 , but a number of tyres could not be changed for that date and that is why we opted for the date on the tyre . #% Just to show that this question is not only of interest to Swedish Members of the European Union but to other nationalities as well , is this new procedure in the Council in operation ? #% Less smugness please , more practical application . #% The petitioners have been asked , in some instances , to pay up to ten times the level of customs duties without any due recognition of the actual value of the motor vehicle . #% In this respect , it is an unexpected welcome break . #% That is the first objective . #% The UN recognises the right of the Timorese people to self-determination and Portugal ' s sovereignty in its territory . #% I know that work is being done to ensure that maximum long-term economic benefit will be gained by harnessing the East Midlands textile cluster . #% Mr President , it is right and proper that the European Union should focus strongly on human rights issues . #% I am sure Mr Elles will take that in the manner in which it is meant . #% I understand that this it is difficult for the Commissioner to react immediately but on a future occasion we would like a response from the Commission as to how we can ensure that this very worthy legislation is uniformly applied throughout European waters to ships , irrespective of flag . #% Members need to be made aware of that before they start expecting new monies to be made available by the Council . #% We have heard all along about the problems of the beef industry from our Irish and other colleagues and the pressures on the industry at the moment . #% I would like to speak on one point in Mr Gillis ' report : his amendment concerning the Irish situation . #% As this policy changes , I would like to see a much more regular system of annual reporting and involvement with this House , because the Northern Dimension concerns all our citizens . #% When they are finalised the decisions relating to changes that do not require alteration of the Staff Regulations will be implemented . #% I have to say gently , but firmly , Commissioner , that those are fine words but we shall be watching you . #% But it is also essential to include matters of justice , security and policing , since , by their nature , police , judicial cooperation and criminal law measures , however desirable , are the most likely to raise concerns about human rights . #% Yet again Mr Rothley has been imaginative on the subject of inventions . #% Finally , I know that Mr Bushill-Matthews intends to table an oral amendment to Amendment 5 to place emphasis upon the need to retain older people in the workforce . #% I thank you , President Barroso , and your team , for elevating the internal market to the top of the agenda where it ought to be . #% I told them that was wrong and that the new law said that they were entitled to that compensation . #% Mr President , since I oppose virtually everything that the European Union proposes to spend money on during the budget year of 2006 , I can not be expected to support this report or its motion for a resolution . #% Paragraph 3 warns the Member States that if Article 32 and Annex XV are maintained in the Accession Treaty in their current form , Parliament will regard this as an infringement of its prerogatives in budgetary matters . #% It squares Turkey 's candidacy with that of the other states , sending a signal that we will be fair and straightforward with Turkey and setting an example of the political consistency that we expect and require from the Turks . #% It is worth noting that their primary purpose is to provide a constructive platform for engagement with third countries on human rights . #% Nevertheless , the restriction on freedom of expression is something we should be pressing the country about , as well as the discrimination against the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam . #% Well , yes it does , because we will now have in place a similar set of rights for buses and coaches to those that we currently have for other modes of transport . #% This being so , far more can be done to encourage organ donations by investing in education programmes at national levels , than by diverting funds to pay for well-intentioned bureaucratic meddling . #% No one knows at this stage exactly what will be the nature , and the possible spread , of the SARS disease . #% The position announced by their Prime Minister , pushed by their industry ministry , was not a position they had agreed on a consensual basis . #% The report contains references ( at second hand ) to prison facilities in the United Kingdom and indeed in other Member States . #% In Britain , as in other countries facing general elections in the next couple of years , one of the central issues will be : in whose hands is the future of Europe safe ? #% However , we will all vote in favour -- I hope even Mr Knapman . #% To get an agreement on the new financial perspectives needs an interinstitutional agreement . #% It is extremely unsatisfactory that the Italian Presidency is opening a text to which it knows that it will be difficult to find a solution and which will seriously affect consumer protection . #% It must be borne in mind that the national courts are the first guardians of the Community legal order and therefore the Commission deals with a relatively small proportion of Community law infringements . #% In Amendment No 8 we look at the issue of the transposition period to be allowed to the Member States . #% Over the years we have seen masterpieces of unintended consequences from this place . #% As the judge remarked , these proprietors were perfectly at liberty to hold or discuss their personal views on homosexuality , but what they could not do was discriminate on the basis of those views . #% The price rises as your rights go . #% Not surprisingly his health suffered . #% Buckingham Palace was a minute corner of whole footprint of Saddam Hussein 's palaces . #% We found no discernible statistical evidence of an increase in social benefit claims . #% I would also like to particularly support Amendment No 3 from the Socialist Group . #% In the dire economic crisis the dangers of an appalling catastrophe are considerable , but without extensive political change they will be much greater . #% On the Buitenweg report , can I comment on the fact that enlargement is a problem . #% 
It is right to try and Europeanise the debate in that way . #% Finally , there is a rise of anti-Europeanism , not least in the ten new countries that joined us two years ago . #% It is two and a half years since we first spoke about this in the Chamber and you assured me that French ski instructors would allow the British to work that year . #% Mr President , I thank the Swedish representative for his reply but it does not satisfy my enquiry . #% We might also note that the European Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights made a similar recommendation when we talked about the programme for the elderly and that there was no other adequate legal alternative . #% That might be a lofty target but one worth aiming for . #% It has suspended those who raise questions and problems and has actually rewarded those who have been involved in covering these things up . #% In conclusion , I would say so far so good ; in fact , better than we had hoped for . #% author . - Mr President , international humanitarian law is a relatively new and somewhat imperfect body of jurisprudence , but it has already achieved some major successes . #% I would echo what has been said by our colleague , Ms Bauer , in terms of our own Member States taking action to sign and ratify some of the conventions and protocols which are missing at the moment . #% We particularly welcome the fact that the Commission proposal is based on four key elements : first - safety , secondly - maintaining open markets , thirdly - securing competitiveness and finally - clear guidelines for state aid . #% If we suspend the Association Agreement , we will merely reinforce the Israeli perception of a perfidious Europe . #% In the past , we have seen the use of chemical weapons in the north , the decimation of the gypsies , the persecution of Jews , the Assyrian Christians , over three-quarters of a million displaced people , assaults on Shia Muslims and those of Iranian descent . #% What it lacks is clarity and legal certainty . #% After all , we are all grown-up democracies . #% I hope that the biotechnology industry will get a tremendous boost from the adoption of this report . #% Last week , the total slaughter exceeded 25 , 000 and that includes the cold storage and 1 , 500 further emergencies . #% I thank the Commissioner for a very full answer and for agreeing with me that this is an unsatisfactory position . #% For those in the audio-visual sector , this is a situation which has worsened , not improved . #% First , there is an ongoing confusion about the funding of certain NGOs and the monies provided by the Commission for their funding . #% I took the trouble of reading their 1988 charter , which is chillingly medieval , bigoted and steeped in incitement to anti-Semitism and support for Jihad and Sharia law . #% Studies in Ireland and Denmark , as well as the UK , show that this eats up some 4 % of charities ' total expenditure . #% Many of us have dealt with constituency cases , because of problems or loopholes in insurance cover . #% The conditions vary : in some Member States age alone is sufficient , in others age is combined with income or even residence . #% If it took her that long because she had no power of treaty to support her , what happens to the unknown and obscure artist who is placed in the position which the questioner has raised tonight ? #% I could also thank Mr Jarzembowski for saying many of the things I was going to say , which is a rare thing indeed . #% The emphasis should be on the first of these , and this is reflected very much in paragraph 1 of the Galeote report which , and I quote : `` Insists that the overriding priority for the external service of the Commission must be the efficient organisation and management of EU external assistance programmes '' . #% In conclusion , we commend the report to the Commission , the Council and Parliament as a whole . #% in writing . - The ECR Group does not recognise a substantial amount of the Goldstone report and hence we did not vote in favour of the PPE motion for resolution and the joint motion for resolution . #% It is for this reason that the EU can never impose a sustainable development strategy on Britain . #% For too long mobile phone companies have been charging outrageous sums to people using their phones elsewhere in the EU . #% I am disappointed to see that out of a possible 15 % , only 2 % of resources have been allocated to capacity building in the country strategy papers drawn up so far . #% I should like to call upon the Commission and the Council -- and again upon you , Mr President -- to redouble diplomatic efforts with the Libyan authorities in order to bring this matter to a speedy and just conclusion , with the immediate release of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor . #% The war in Lebanon was caused by Hizbollah kidnapping Israeli soldiers which , unsurprisingly , triggered retaliation by the Israelis and the escalating conflict we have witnessed . #% They are quite limited but important . #% Surprisingly for a lawyer , he does not seem to know that very similar arrangements exist with the European Union . #% I hope this Parliament will reject it . #% I am sure that a number of the staff in this Parliament will recognise that feeling . #% If we put those together we will address the issues for the years ahead in an enlarged European Union . #% Adopting any other amendment might put that at risk by reopening the procedure , which would be a matter of great concern to the research community . #% Furthermore , a large proportion of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Britain and other European countries originate from Afghanistan . #% Every country that wants to become a Member State of the EU must commit to that principle and be signatory to the ECHR , not least with regard to sexual orientation . #% From 1889 to 1952 Eritrea was under the flags firstly of Italy , then of Britain . #% We understand the Commission 's wish to ensure full value for sums expended by the Community , but we do not believe that the same procedure can be used in the case of agreements where access to resources is based on vessels and tonnage . #% Now we hear the half-time whistle , but I suspect Mr Barroso is not a man to listen to whistle-blowers . #% We are also asking for action by the government of Pakistan , not least to remove the reservations on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - which they ratified with a large number of reservations - and we urged this in our recent delegation visit to Pakistan . #% Look out truckers , because Big Barrot is watching you . #% We need to encourage them to do that . #% The European Union and individual countries must do more to address the problems and circumstances in the countries of origin that cause people to seek refuge in the European Union . #% Lastly , the question of radioactivity is perhaps not one for this measure , as one of the amendments suggests . #% The report also says that it is important that Member States should be considering a minimum wage . #% Even allowing for Treaty limitations , there are severe concerns that this will be completely insufficient . #% I call upon Member States who oppose the war -- such as France and Germany -- to put this behind them now and support new Nato initiatives to build up security in Iraq . #% There is now a properly functioning market economy and progress has been made on privatisation . #% Mr President , I am as disappointed as my colleagues at the response . #% Thirdly , concerning the lifts , I have been stuck twice in a lift - which might not surprise you if you look at me . #% I should also like to point out to him and to you , Madam President , that he needs to go through the text of his communication to make absolutely certain there is nothing in it which will frighten people into thinking that this recommendation is in any way promoting drug use . #% President Prodi has supported this target . #% We must insist that Member States implement this proposal as soon as possible . #% Therefore , the only way we could do that was by this very quick procedure , through the committee on Tuesday , by a letter from the President . #% The trouble is that it highlight dual or treble standards operating throughout the Community . #% Look at the restrictions that are being imposed on children 's programmes , on advertising medicinal products , advertisements that offend philosophical beliefs , controls on advertising time . #% I must also pay tribute to our rapporteur for his hard work on the production of a well thought-out , highly considered , fair and balanced report . #% I am drawn to speak before my co-rapporteur merely by reason of being first in the alphabet and not of seniority in this Parliament . #% Internal politics has also been a feature of this debate . #% But for the life of me I can not see why you have actually made cuts in Category 1 . #% 
Whilst we fully support the aims of the Rapporteur in ensuring a reduction in road traffic accidents , we nevertheless feel the best way to achieve this is through an exchange of best practice between Member States rather than legislation at a European level . #% However , that is not the case with this proposal . #% Mr President , the Commissioner was about to tell us whether or not the Commission believed that a total ban was going to be Commission policy or not and then , certainly as far as the interpreting was concerned , I never heard the answer to that question . #% We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level . #% One constituent demonstrated to me in the most vivid terms what exactly those consequences will be . #% I wish to make it clear that we are not against artists . #% We have to look further at what constitutes goods or services in health and other care . #% This would ensure respect for democratic accountability , integrity of public administration , non-discrimination , civil liberties and the rule of law . #% As the rapporteur , he has quite properly had to tell the House that the Environment Committee voted by a substantial majority - I think 33 votes to 13 - in favour of the excision of the provisions relating to category of animal . #% A true constitutional step forward will be achieved only if such a pluralistic formula is agreed . #% I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 when the Delors report was all the rage and we had a quest to reduce unemployment by 15 million by the year 2000 . #% Finally , we call on Indonesia to investigate with urgency the disappearance of the human rights defender Abdussalam Deli , and the killing of his colleague , Raja Ismail . #% Firstly , the EU is not the origin but the expression of peace in post-war Europe , which is underpinned by democracy in the nation-states and respect for the rule of law . #% We need a grown-up debate on these issues to ensure that there is a balanced mix of renewable and other low carbon sources of energy to ensure that the lights stay on across Europe . #% The motion before this House calls for coordinated action to fight the scourge of racism and discrimination , which has led , even in recent years , to genocide or massacres like that in Rwanda . #% As far as the other parts of the undertaking are concerned , will he confirm that the Alstom management will be free to consider offers and to sell other parts of the business to whomsoever they choose and wherever they come from ? #% But I do fear that all we are really doing is consolidating Gaddafi 's power , which , in due course , inevitably will pass to one of his sons in a dynastic succession akin to that of North Korea . #% Cultural change will ultimately concretise the ideals and ideas that we all have in promoting our future together . #% Second , Fiji should be banned from all international sporting and cultural events . #% That cooperative principle dates not least from the work of Robert Owen in my own Member State and is something which we celebrate in this debate . #% I do not think the European Union should be pushed around in this way by the United States and its friends in the multinational banana-producing countries . #% If it had not happened , both countries would today be within the 3 % limit . #% Already we have seen a lot of industry relocating to outside the EU , simply , of course , transferring emissions from the EU to China , India and elsewhere . #% That is why I welcome Commissioner Kinnock 's statement that the Commission will monitor the transition in all its formats . #% In 2002 Peugeot asked the European Commission to approve a state aid package to build the new 207 model at Ryton in the English West Midlands . #% . -- Mr President , Africa has for too long been torn by civil strife , hunger , economic mismanagement and blatant corruption . #% I find that particularly worrying when I remember its developing nuclear capability . #% In order to be consistent and non-discriminatory , any such bans would affect the Sikh turban , the Jewish kippa or skullcap , and Christian crosses . #% Maybe an abstention can mean a different thing . #% The north west of England , for example , may generate more traffic fumes than many places elsewhere in Europe but , because we are not blessed with too much sunlight , ozone is less of a problem to us than it may be in Spain . #% I hope Mr Byrne , when he comes to reply , will be able to tell us . #% Meanwhile , the British fishing fleet has sunk to less than a quarter of its previous size . #% We have learnt more details about the Commission 's implementation checks -- or rather I should say checklist . #% I would have liked , this afternoon , to have heard a commitment from the Luxembourg presidency to strengthen the common position to make it mandatory to control EU nationals involved in arms brokering , wherever they are based . #% Serious response to reports , confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure . #% In addition , as you will also be aware , the Commission is strongly motivated by a practical desire to negotiate conditions in civil aviation that will be fair , balanced and certain to uphold the interests of the Community , of all its Member States , of the civil aviation industry of the European Union and of the citizens of the Union . #% The extension to six months of the minimum period of outstanding pay claims to be guaranteed would also significantly increase public expenditure and go well beyond the social aims of the Directive . #% I say , let the market provide the answer . #% Kyrgyzstan was the first CIS country to be accepted into the WTO , and most state companies have been sold off , although , regrettably , cronyism and corruption have been rife . #% For that reason , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I hope the European Commission will pick up the demands in this report , draw up a list of substances which are known to be hormone - mimicking , take action to start to phase out those substances or minimise their use , start to look at legislation on pollution control and water quality legislation to ensure these substances are reduced to a minimum or completely eradicated in the environment , and really put some effort into a research programme which will look into the real mechanisms of endocrine disruption . #% It is simply to send something back and we have been given no notice of this . #% Can you guarantee that the Commission will not use qualified majority voting on any of those issues ? #% The fact that France , Germany and the Netherlands are now following the UK 's example in deploying it in relation to the medical professions serves to demonstrate that the line the UK has always taken is the practical one . #% The threat posed by Pakistan , particularly by harbouring terrorists , to India over Kashmir also poses a grave threat to the whole region . #% Mr President-in-Office , from what you have just said , is there therefore an understanding or an expectation in E-11 that after they have had an informal discussion about the euro in Euro-11 , they will all vote the same way when they go to Ecofin , even if they disagreed originally ? #% In my own country in the last three days there have been front-page articles about the effects of mobile phones and in my local newspapers stories about power lines and their effects on people . #% Just because it was invented in the United States does not mean it is all bad . #% But they were betrayed . #% I agree with much of what Mrs Wallis says . #% ` Takes the view that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is impeding the development of Armenia and Azerbaijan and regional cooperation as well as the effective implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy as such ; calls on both parties to refrain from unilateral actions and aggressive statements and to work for settlement of the conflict in a constructive dialogue with all the forces concerned , on the basis of respect for minority rights and on the basis of the principles of international law ; ' -- that is key -- ` emphasises the importance of continuing democratic reforms for the development of the region and its relations with the EU ; urges all parties concerned to find ways to permit the gradual return of refugees on the basis of minority rights , in particular with regard to the return of Azerbaijanis to the occupied territories ; calls on the member countries of the OSCE Minsk group to coordinate more effectively their action with the EU Special Representative for South Caucasus in order to move forward with negotiations ' . #% We should be looking at some of the impacts of liberalisation on China itself , because there is ample proof to suggest that many of the poorest people in China face significant losses themselves , particularly in the agricultural sector , as a result of China 's accession to the WTO . #% As others have said , we have seen a deliberately created legal limbo here , which has provided a green light for other regimes to act in similar ways now , not least China , Yemen , Uzbekistan , Saudi Arabia and other well-known democracies , with their policy of internment of so-called fundamentalists . #% This is a highly contentious issue . #% The British Conservatives are therefore against this report . #% Is it possible that these fishing boats , which are guaranteed to fish outside Member States , should be excluded from the MAGP process altogether ? #% With existing nationally-based schemes we are learning by doing , and we must continue to do so . #% Of course not all our Member States have yet chosen or will ever choose to join the single currency . #% European comparisons will show up , one hopes , strengths but also weaknesses that are currently hidden by evaluation systems limited to a single educational system . #% I would also like to align myself with Mr Wynn 's rather than Mr Davies ' remarks about the British rebate , hardly surprisingly . #% Much easier , therefore , to create another European institution and get rid of the whole messy business . #% Unless we have the opportunity which these amendments provide for action to be taken within the normal processes over a longer period of time , we run the risk that the manufacturers of products may escape liability without expensive legal proceedings intended once again to change the law . #% For those of us who support the principle of the nation states coming together to cooperate freely in Europe , the progress of the Lisbon Treaty perhaps should not be such a cause for celebration today . #% There is no justification for taking animals on huge journeys for slaughter -- whenever possible they must be slaughtered in the country where they are reared . #% This is a substantial and very important proposal . #% On the Middle East the language agreed was , on the whole , balanced . #% They panicked , but managed to pay their debts . #% 
In the next few years we have a vital role to play in examining the financial framework and the framework with a view to the enlargement , because that is when we will see the strains on Socrates II and its ability to deal with a new enlarged European Union . #% We hope that there will still be room for such projects , provided that they support the employment strategy . #% Some of you might find that a little surprising , as it is well known that Commissioner Bolkestein and I have not seen eye to eye on this matter all of the time . #% But no , the plight of bees is used as an excuse to introduce a whole host of regulations calling , amongst other things , for cooperation between beekeepers ' associations from Member States , tighter controls on the importation of honey , increased labelling requirements - hardly designed to stop the bees dying , surely - product authorisation , whatever that is , and a move to recruit young beekeepers . #% First of all , opt-in , opt-out . #% Europe , not least with the euro among the world currencies , can improve the international approach towards globalisation . #% His main achievement has been to persecute the successive whistleblowers who have revealed the appalling debts of the Commission 's failure . #% On the assumption that you somehow succeed in either of these , where will consumers turn for their 83 million daily eggs ? #% We need to have a dialogue with China over the situation in North Korea , where it has been playing an important role chairing the six-party talks ; over Iran , where China can play a role in trying to find a solution to the nuclear crisis ; and over Darfur , where China , because of its oil interests , has to date been resisting the deployment of UN forces . #% We are supporters of the single market . #% They need to understand the difference between winter flu -- which is not what this debate is about -- and avian flu -- which is not what this debate is about , even though 67 people have died from it , all working or living with birds and poultry in Asia . #% This nuance should enable the Commission to accept our text and to consider that the agreement we have negotiated remains valid . #% These are general points , but there are some specific points that we can not support . #% Secondly , there are amendments intended to take account of the enlargement of the Union , clarify and improve the functioning of the Governing Board and strengthen its strategic role and the executive role of the Bureau . #% However , if we get this process wrong , the European Union will at best become a bloated introverted structure incapable of making effective decisions and it could become one which will be in danger of losing any concept of a common vocation . #% Every issuer would be supervised by national authorities and we know that the potential for money-supply growth caused by this sort of issuance would be extremely slight given the sort of schemes which are already operating in a number of Member States : for example , on university campuses a student may be able to use this piece of plastic to buy something in a bar , or in a canteen , or in the university bookshop . #% I would say to the presidency , in solidarity and in defence of international labour law , that we should not remain silent on this and we should not just stand aside and allow a flagrant abuse of workers ' rights . #% Few imagined 20 years ago that the borders of the European Union would extend to the Baltic States and Poland . #% The last time you did this it was rather confusing . #% I shall be voting in favour and would hope that Parliament can support my report so that the proposed framework can be put into operation #% That Act promotes the production and feeding of renewable energies and directs investments into local economies . #% Mr President , my government says that the British budget rebate is defensible , and it is ! #% He knows my view that essentially China is going to do exactly the same , and why would n't it ? #% Television is without frontiers . #% Consensus has rightly emerged that an important component of the way to reconnect Europe with national political life , and through that with European citizens , is through an alliance between the European Parliament and national parliaments and national politics , which at present seem to give insufficient weight to thorough and comprehensive scrutiny of European matters . #% I respect the European Parliament 's view on the embargo , but here we are insisting that all our partnership countries follow an embargo that puts China in the same situation as Burma and Zimbabwe -- which I consider personally to be rather worse in terms of their oppression and discrimination -- while , at the same time , asking the Chinese to assist us in putting pressure on those two countries that we say are exactly the same as China . #% If there is a need and if it is safe , then why not ? #% No doubt we will be told today that the Belgian laws giving effect to these EU directives do not apply to the Commission as a public administration , and yet these teachers were employed on Belgian employment contracts that are subject to Belgian employment law . #% As far as the report is concerned directly , can I say that I agree with the rapporteur 's point regarding the nickel content of the coins . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate Mrs Ţicău , who has worked with tremendous dedication on this dossier . #% In some ways , you could argue , we should start at the end and look at how we enforce it and then work backwards as a way of getting simpler legislation . #% I believe that the original Commission communication was an amazing document in the way it brought together many cross-cutting issues across a number of DGs in the Commission . #% We should therefore keep to the ban on meat and bone meal . #% The global advantages of the Sixth Framework Programme need to be fully translated to our citizens : all sections of society , from young scientists to disabled and elderly people are set to gain from its contents . #% I wonder what it is that makes them fear OLAF having the right to verify that Members are conducting their affairs properly in this House . #% I agree , and I welcome strengthening the links with Ukraine and Moldova in particular . #% I would like to ask two questions specifically , to add to what he has told us already . #% I am in favour of temporary workers receiving protection but believe that it is probably best left to Member States , rather than having the ` fit-all ' directive which we have in front of us today . #% Could the Commissioner say what formula the Commission will be using to allocate Structural Fund resources to the Objective 1 areas for the period 2000 to 2006 ? #% We must be humane , fair and reasonable . #% It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty . #% We will be watching very closely . #% Month after month , ministers told us that such a marketing ban would be contrary to WTO rules , but these objections were at last overcome during our middle-of-the-night negotiations . #% If the Internet is really to deliver its full potential as a global knowledge network , as an instantly accessible medium , then we have to encourage people to use it in such a way that they become detached from the feeling that , with a time-based connection , they have to hurry through what they are doing , that the facilities are not always there and available to them . #% It is a most unpleasant feud made all the more unpleasant by the fact that one side is enjoying the support of the President of Russia . #% What we are talking about is nothing less than offsetting and overcoming half a century of Soviet occupation , oppression , misrule and marginalisation . #% We must have more and better jobs ; we must make work pay ; we must have a more dynamic social model aimed at getting more people into work -- particularly those traditionally excluded ; we must avoid having a two-tier workforce and we need a more productive workforce . #% The key area of provocation has been covered by the minister and by the Commissioner , including the issue of the sale in the EU of goods labelled as Israeli but coming from the settlements . #% This is the same Local Education Authority that , until last week , was failing to provide any education or school places to 20 children in the same area . #% In particular , representatives of the Mediterranean countries point out problems resulting from the strong sunlight they enjoy . #% But when are they going to reap the benefits of the Western democratic system ? #% I wish to thank him for illustrating so clearly the kinds of bullying tactics that have been employed . #% But in achieving that objective , I for one will not see the rights of Parliament sacrificed . #% But , happily , the committee in Parliament has looked at this proposal in great detail and is in favour of it . #% The Commission should welcome this , and I look forward to hearing its response to those proposals . #% Belgium is a microcosm of the entire European Union . #% Mr Anastassopoulos referred to that as a surprising new development . #% Instead , I must deplore both the manipulation of the parliamentary timetable to bring this report before this minisession and the blatant , partisan , party-political nature of much of the text . #% Mr President , I share the view of those , in particular our spokesman , Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra , who have said that this issue of transatlantic relations should now be focused on what we have in common rather than on our differences , which we all know and which many speakers have mentioned . #% Today , in June 1997 , the Commission is asking the Council to endorse a very inadequate and unsatisfactory agreement with Canada and Russia and nothing at all with the United States . #% I believe that we should all vote for this agreement to go ahead because , among other things , it will help to achieve a better human rights and democratic rights record in Mexico over the course of future years . #% I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops . #% I wonder if the Commissioner would join me in deploring the way in which this report has been treated , with parts - notably the ladders - being isolated and suggestions made - by Mr Bushill-Matthews for one - that this is something that is futile if not childish . #% We are working as a team to assist Romania in her progress towards the European Union . #% Finally , it is very important to reiterate what Mrs Pack said about having a long term strategy for the audio-visual sector in the European Union , a long term coordinated and integrated strategy that allows us to benefit from each other 's strengths in every Member State . #% Mr President , so , the Irish presidency is handed the political hot potato of the draft European Constitution . #% 
However , we are not succeeding . #% We must bear in mind that the policies and procedures adopted by the registry will need to reflect best practice in the field . #% And we have a new president of Europe , Herman Van Rompuy . #% We have seen relative peace in the whole of southern Africa . #% I always thought it was marvellous that the percentage of gross national product coming into European spending was declining . #% And we believe that the most important element is to ensure that labour markets are flexible enough to ensure that young people can gain employment . #% Nonetheless , at the same time we must urge all states to continue to support the work of the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia . #% I urge the Member States that are being difficult over this proposal to wake up . #% We must ensure openness and respect for liberty and democracy in the adoption of anti-terrorism measures , but in the 30-page terrorism roadmap you will only find Parliament mentioned four times . #% It would be ambitious for a two-year presidency , but for one of 99 days , as the President-in-Office has pointed out , I fear that it is too ambitious . #% The then General Affairs Council decided in December 1998 , on the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , that the European Union should enhance its actions on human rights , and that it should draw up an annual report on human rights . #% The last thought is that now we are going to have enlargement -- 25 countries -- we know the difficulties will be very great in managing a European Union . #% The Council of Europe guidelines on detaining suspects without fair trial have certainly been breached in the United Kingdom and probably in other EU countries . #% This includes the rights , for example , of the Roma people in some of the Eastern European countries . #% We need to examine the consequences of our policies on , for example , trade , its rules and terms and who we will trade with , the conduct of companies based in the European Union and their operations in other countries such as Nigeria , the arms sales by Member States to repressive regimes . #% But as we negotiate the final outcome I say to Parliament and the Commission that even a raised kerb at every bus stop can never be the full access solution . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to kindly answer Mr Davis ' original question : is the Council aware of any website maintained by a public authority which is better designed to frustrate ? #% I hope to avoid any more high-flown rhetoric about a Europe of values while our leaders refuse to act . #% On this side of the House we are realistic . #% The regulation will trigger a raft of reforms . #% All this is necessary , but it is time to rebalance the work programme . #% Somebody of a different sexual orientation should be allowed to use any hotel room that they want to , and stay at any hotel when they go on holiday . #% Twenty years ago , communist regimes could stop human beings getting across the Berlin Wall , but they could not stop television signals being beamed into East German homes . #% Furthermore , this case once again highlights the clear need to establish an effective and efficient common European system for asylum and the same for immigration , including legal migration , as a matter of urgency . #% Illegal tapping of water supplies and questions of water access intermingled with nationalist rivalries could easily explode at any moment . #% I want us and the Commissioner to keep those people who are dying of these diseases in mind and see what we can do . #% It seems incredible to me that a British Government should go to the European Court of Justice and try to put Sunday into the same category as every other day . #% I want to see the production quota cut by 115 000 tonnes each year and to abolish the reimbursement of storage cuts . #% Burma will need our help , not least to develop a strong civil society and a legal system which should focus on transitional justice for the many crimes committed by the junta . #% As Mrs Schreyer said in the statement , the application of those tools to economic , social , health , educational and a whole range of other developments is extremely important . #% Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 , as amended , will lay down the principles , conditions and limits of public access to the documents of those agencies , but it will not , in itself , create obligations for agencies . #% Finally , the call for close cooperation with the relevant bodies is pertinent : when there is a suspected food risk it makes sense that the Authority should capitalise on the knowledge available in other related associations . #% I therefore could not support it . #% However , I hope that Ireland 's historic relations with the United States will serve to promote , if not a full , free trade EU-USA agreement -- now that the WTO , post-Cancun , is fatally wounded -- at least a common economic space for trade in goods and services , particularly financial services . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his kind remarks and concern . #% Mr President , I very much hope that even at this very late stage , right up to the wire , we can achieve a compromise on this package between the three institutions . #% In paragraph 47 , ` Community Assistance for Reconstruction , Development and Stabilisation ( CARDS ) ' should be replaced with ` instrument for accession ( ISPA ) . ' #% For instance , the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered . #% As Commissioner Mandelson pointed out , the round was not a failure , but it was hardly a success either . #% Furthermore , Ukraine has no postal votes , which have been implicated in my country , the United Kingdom , as subject to fraud . #% I want to ask the President-in-Office two questions . #% These businesses are facing huge cost increases themselves and can not sustain the status quo for more than a few months . #% In addition , 20 , 000 calves have been slaughtered since 29 March , 4 , 000 a week . #% However , I want to pay a sincere tribute to those who work in the institutions and have made the registers and access to documents a reality . #% Mr President , I want to speak specifically about the oral question from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , which concerns bioterrorism . #% As she said , she has taken advice from a lot of people . #% Because of my own involvement I have , quite rightly , not played any direct part in the inquiry 's proceedings , but it seems clear to me that its findings make a valuable contribution to drawing the right lessons from the 2001 outbreak . #% Mr President , on behalf of those Members who are still here I would like to congratulate you , Mr President , on your excellent conduct of the business today . #% Can I say first of all tonight that I am tempted to suggest that we do a study on the health effects of always working in darkness . #% Thus I would see them as one of the groups who will be very much in our minds as we prepare to take action against exclusion . #% Primary responsibility in this area lies with Member States . #% I am delighted to see Mrs Schreyer here today , who hopefully is going to talk about accounting control . #% Animal diseases and natural disasters are going to happen and we must find a flexible approach to these . #% Many of us will remember all too well the failure of the special initiative for African recovery . #% I plead for a safe route from my office into this plenary session , not only for me but for other Members here who suffer from other breathing problems . #% But I believe that the only way that rationalization can take place is if the industry itself decides how to do it , given a very strict environmental framework within which it has to work . #% It is important that untruths are rapidly rebutted . #% Hence , we were horrified to realise that the original proposal would have allowed any professional to go to any other EU country and practise there for 16 weeks without any authorisation , checks or vetting . #% Rightly - and I congratulate him on his telepathic powers - he has anticipated two particular amendments which cause us difficulty . #% This is primarily an issue of subsidiarity and should not even be considered at a European level , quite apart from whether such charging is right in principle , given the vast amounts which the motorist already pays in taxation . #% Would the President-in-Office use his good offices to try to facilitate some kind of high level political peace process , perhaps using the offices of Mary Robinson who is now human rights representative for the United Nations ? #% You have in front of you a report with the amendments , the majority of which the Socialist Group can support , some of which we feel go too far . #% Surely we should be encouraging more investment in these sectors . #% In conclusion , I want to thank the Commissioner for the remarks he made in the commercial communication , where he said Parliament comes to rescue the internal market . #% On this basis , the PSE Group can support this proposal , which will be put to the vote tomorrow morning . #% 
I was involved in the British general election and also in the mayor-making of my wife , which is why I was unable to be here . #% Part of that state of competitiveness is to have a system of company law and capital markets that enables it to compete . #% How does one know when the votes are on ? #% . Mr President , we have seen the proposed Constitution for Europe rejected by the French and Dutch people . #% Above all , the insistence now that public authorities in particular also have to conform to the standards applied to the private sector and can not abuse their position against small suppliers by complying with these requirements , is absolutely central . #% It is also important for us to stress best practice , particularly in the area of research and development . #% I know there has been opposition to it in some quarters but I believe it is the least we can do in order to satisfy the necessary concerns at points of interconnection that environmental considerations may be set aside in the course of negotiations between the old and new players in this market . #% Madam President , I withdraw my request for a point of order . #% My own view is that the directive , as drafted , would have done exactly the opposite and cut across the possibility of achieving the Lisbon agenda . #% We should all be very pleased that we have the European Union to spearhead action in this area . #% As we move forwards to an EU of 27 , let us celebrate the diversity of the modern European Union ; let us harness that diversity to work together for a true Europe of nation states . #% The reason that the topic is so important is that demand for access to EU databases is growing at a fast pace . #% Finally , although Ukraine is a country not directly linked to this debate , I hope also that , regardless of the results of the impending presidential elections in Ukraine , the EU will continue to hold out the possibility of eventual EU membership for Ukraine , if that is indeed the majority view of the people of Ukraine . #% The Commissioner will know of the concern in my country , and probably in his also , at the danger , however remote , posed by new variant CJD in the matter of blood plasma products . #% In particular he could whisper across the table to Mr Clark and encourage the British Government to have a full debate in the British Parliament in the very near future on this issue . #% So our poor treatment by the Council should not compromise the EU 's agreement with the United States , or any future agreements on the security of Europe . #% The pedantic constitutional purist from any one Member State might cavil at some of the detail , but this report provides a template for action which can not be carried out by any single parliament . #% Similarly , a tribunal in Tanzania has been prosecuting those responsible for the Rwandan genocide of 1994 . #% I hope that is going to be the case , because long-term care is not the same as long-term intensive care . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for bringing this issue up . #% Nothing short of a cessation of the conflict will end the misery of the Tamils in Sri Lanka and nothing else will end the number of people seeking refuge in the European Union . #% Schoolgirls have been murdered for refusing to wear a veil . #% Today , with all the qualifications , they celebrated . #% That is something we can no doubt expect in future years . #% But culture is an important wealth creator : 17 % of UK GDP comes from the creative industries . #% I am sure that the Commission will want to say something about this . #% I voted in favour of the amendment for the purposes of group solidarity and because I believe that clear support for the concept of an FTT from Europe may spur further discussions at the G20 . #% After those few , relatively negative comments , let me thank the Commission for its help in producing these proposals . #% Mr President , I had the privilege of serving on the human genetics temporary committee in 2001 . #% We have found in the issues raised with us that it is not just environmental NGOs , or people living in an area that is directly affected . #% We should no longer rely on national statistics which tell us that accidents only happen to full-time employees . #% Labour MEPs have two particular concerns which I know are shared by many other Members : one is the issue of derogations . #% I am also inviting the Council to consider targeted sanctions , which is what the Socialist Group would have liked to have done but we did not get any support for it : travel bans perhaps , the freezing of assets . #% Areas such as South Yorkshire and Merseyside in the United Kingdom must continue to benefit if they need it , and if they are shown to need it . #% I put to her that the Prime Minister of Belgium only , in the last few days , said that he does not want to pursue this path towards a European Union tax because `` it is sensitive '' . #% We should seek ways to boost that , in particular , by public-private partnerships . #% However , PNR must only be a tool to combat terrorism . #% Does the Council accept that there might be a case for considering whether the legislation is satisfactory or whether an over-hasty decision was taken under the old procedures and does it also accept that a study would assist us in reaching a sound decision now ? #% My worry is that we face a situation where the Commission , Parliament and the Court think of the Charter as binding but the Council does not , creating a situation that can only result in political and legal confusion . #% The European Union is supposed to have a human rights policy under Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty . #% Its effects are both insular and outgoing and destroy lives . #% I stress our anxieties regarding the establishment of agencies : we have great concerns regarding the accountability of those bodies , as we do over the efficient and effective deployment of human resources throughout the institutions . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , tonight 's debate looks at ways to improve a woman 's lot ; sometimes by positive discrimination such as quotas , sometimes by direct legislation on gender equality . #% With all these measures , I will no longer be stuck for advice when constituents , facing legal problems abroad , call me asking for help . #% It is a report which the UK feels able to support largely because many of the problems relating to earlier reports have been ironed out . #% Mr President , I would also like to talk about the Singapore issues , because there is massive hypocrisy at the heart of the Commission and Council position . #% I hope I express the whole of Parliament 's wish in that sentiment . #% One of the lessons we must learn from this exercise -- and I say this to the select group of colleagues around here -- is that better regulation is a shared task for every single Member of this Parliament , whatever committee they belong to . #% I feel that the report shows the right balance between encouragement of China 's economic and social reforms , as well as denouncing its perennial abuses of human rights and the rule of law . #% This solution is clear : accept Parliament 's position , abandon the extreme policies put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein and I am sure we can have an agreement on the future of postal services within days . #% You can not always drag behind public opinion . #% Sadly , these expectations have not been fulfilled and it is becoming increasingly clear that the influence of the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and of the most fanatical sections of the revolutionary guards is continuing to shape the regime 's policies on human rights and that the new president is apparently in complete accord with this . #% As Commissioner Michel and Commissioner Mandelson have stated , economic partnership agreements must be development-friendly . #% Then , at some stage , in the future , Parliament can table an oral question with debate , where we can have a resolution to wind up the debate . #% It is the small-scale rural sector , including those cultivating drug-linked crops , that should be the object of our development assistance in this field , and hence should be the object of the regulation . #% Furthermore , to gather `` base-set '' level of information simply for chemicals manufactured in volumes over one tonne per year will take approximately 36 years alone , according to the IEH report . #% But once again , the EU assumes the attributes of a political state in order to address this problem and its pretensions are fully supported by a minister of Her Majesty 's Government . #% But , above all , it is the fact that you ignored that Irish referendum , that you said the Irish can not stop this Treaty : for that reason alone , I simply can not support you . #% With this type of guideline we will not go far wrong as we go through this year . #% If the rapporteur can accept that amendment , then my Group will be able to vote for it . #% However , there is a downside . #% But the situation at Sangatte can not be allowed to fester . #% So we are concerned that the first measure does not demonstrate the highest standards . #% The social and human costs have been and still are enormous and unacceptable . #% We as a group would strongly support that . #% The Union learnt the lessons of our relative failure in Kyoto and reached out towards countries in the Group of 77 , looking for allies in the cause of sanity in protecting the climate of the planet . #% 
Later on this morning , there will be a debate on the Lloyd 's of London petitions . #% In order to reach that goal we need politicians , we need governments , we need the Commission , but most of all we also need all sides in the railway industry working together . #% So , to be taken seriously the EU needs to raise its profile and support for economic and democratic reform in Russia . #% I would rather we have maintained the position whereby we were an observer of the ban rather than a supporter of the ban . #% But I would argue still that the zeal to do this must not override the principles of the European treaties . #% President Museveni , after the Bali meeting , said that talk about sustainability is all very well but that market access is the most important issue . #% The report then says that this action should not undermine the ECB 's independence to use its interest rates to control inflation . #% But the commitment secured from the Commission to consider introducing some kind of directive in a couple of years ' time , while welcome , given the Commissioner 's declared support for ensuring that we are enforcing rules and laws effectively , should have been coming any way and adds nothing to previous statements . #% My question to the President-in-Office is very specific : how do you intend to take forward Wim Kok 's very important report ? #% Even though several important derogations were won in committee , the concept of the proposal remains impractical , untenable and unenforceable . #% Mr President , no one is in any doubt that Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator . #% With the increase in commercial transactions across the internal market , we need new , simple and certain rules . #% Ukraine has not found the transition to a market economy an easy process . #% Certain wealthy people are allowed to bring in domestic servants who have no rights whatsoever . #% We have the opportunity to lead the world on sustainability , on innovation , on eco-labelling and so forth , and I believe that is a challenge that the Commission must take up with Parliament . #% I can not believe that this is the intention of the Christian ethic . #% Our duty now must be to make sure that the laws we pass tomorrow are implemented by everyone - the Commission , Member States and port state control authorities . #% I congratulate Mr Sousa Pinto and Mr Turco . #% The challenge , one where the Turkish authorities are failing , is to separate the die-hard opponents of violence and those who want to pursue a democratic route to a political solution . #% Mrs Figueiredo said in her report yesterday that 22 million jobs need to be created in the EU in the next five years . #% I am not necessarily advocating such a development in the European Union but we must look - and that is why I welcome your words Commissioner - at the whole question of public relations . #% Once parts of human organs , blood and tissue are included in the report , it is necessary to ensure that any legal trade that exists in , for example , blood , sperm or human tissue , is not criminalised or penalised . #% We want internal legislation to eliminate disadvantages , albeit minor ones of threshold levels created by the GPA , and to set up controls to safeguard EU citizens and businesses against corruption in the awarding of government contracts . #% Mr President , I rise on a point of order under Rules 166 ( 1 ) and 121 ( 2 ) . #% Up to now , very little has really been done to address the problem of harassment generally , so this report is especially welcome as it allows an open debate on an issue that has all too often been ignored . #% A recent estimate by the British House of Commons Select Committee put the casualty figures as high as 300 000 , with 10 000 people dying each month from disease , starvation and atrocities , and two million people homeless and displaced , destabilising neighbouring Chad . #% It really is an important evening . #% They are about to elect a prime minister . #% We have to make sure we put an end to that . #% Should we have gone further ? #% We need to help prevent illness and we need to educate peoples and governments in Europe that mental illness is not to be feared , not to be ignored . #% We have to find an alternative to the bloodshed and to the continuation of this dispute . #% This proposal simply adds more red tape and costs to an already overburdened industry . #% If African countries are willing to wreck the ACP for the sake of defending Mugabe , let them do it , but let us stop making exceptions all the time with respect to this travel ban . #% That is the next stage and we ought to be encouraging it . #% They want to convey the importance not only of qualified staff to supervise the process but also of training for all those who handle blood , because human error is the biggest source of accident in this respect . #% I also believe that the provisions should be invoked on the grounds of public security to prevent the free movement of German neo-Nazis who produce Holocaust denial material in Denmark with the clear intention of reimporting it into Germany , where it is illegal . #% We should look again at this and consider carefully what we are doing to those who produce this material in the Philippines . #% I would like to see greater real competition which would result in realistic charging and higher standards of consumer service . #% Given Algeria 's position in an earthquake area it would certainly be prudent to have such things available for the future . #% I do not , however , accept -- unlike some Members of this House -- that this ban can be automatically extended to the legitimate military use of other munitions , such as anti-tank mines , as they , for instance , are less readily available to non-regular forces , because they are much more expensive and tend to be laid in a well-mapped and systematic fashion , which enables speedy clearance in peacetime after the cessation of hostilities . #% One group of people really does deserve credit : the civil servants of the European Union , both those who have contributed to the design and development of the reform programme and those who , in a time of turmoil , have shown patience , understanding and commitment in thinking up the ideas , considering the proposals being made , suggesting improvements and showing the goodwill that demonstrates a high standard of professional commitment to the cause of Europe . #% We therefore reserve the right to make ourselves heard when we believe that unwarranted political pressure is being directed against the independence of the European Central Bank . #% The second development is also important , however . #% That too is a respectable organization . #% There is a yawning gap , an unbridgeable gap . #% Parliament has always argued that correspondence regarding possible enforcement proceedings between Member States and the Commission should be shared . #% If we are to wean ourselves off fossil fuels - especially oil and coal - we will need all the low-carbon energy technologies we can get . #% We welcome this legislation because it is important that the information outlined is made available to those purchasers for whom environmental and economy considerations are paramount . #% What is fascinating about this debate , as it was in committee and here now , is that for the best possible reasons - the improvement of health and enhancing the environment - measures have been suggested to us which represent a sort of creeping centralisation which , at the end of the day , makes the European Union seem bossy and interfering to far too many of our constituents . #% Mr President , I commend you for recently taking up the question of Air France services to Strasbourg from London , as reflected in today 's Financial Times . #% I have said many times before that if the EU is the answer then the question must have been a stupid one . #% The Committee concerned has written to you . #% Therefore I fully support the proposed target date . #% I would like to start by paying tribute to Commissioner Wallström , the Commissioner for the Environment . #% Colleagues around the chamber have been quoted , and indeed Mr Simitis was quoted in the Financial Times yesterday , as saying that ` we are in a global recession ' . #% Looking for jobs , taking part in civic society , acting in a democracy - all is predicated on having access to , and use of , a telephone . #% We need wider and deeper reflection . #% We need coherent long-term thinking that will allow foreign policy issues to run through both pillar 1 and pillar 2 issues . #% Mr President , we congratulate Mr Arvidsson for his hard work . #% in writing . - Although it is not the norm for me to abstain , I felt that , for today 's vote on the election of the President of the Commission , abstention was the right choice . #% What do they see about the relationships between human beings ? #% This would lead to very peculiar road signs in the UK resulting in bizarre figures when speed limits are converted from Km/h to miles per hour . #% Madam President , I have no more information than you on this series of arrests . #% That millions of citizens in countries across the world agree with me is really quite comforting . #% Secretary of State Rice 's statement begged more questions than it answered . #% 
To summarise a number of the other concerns raised by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , we believe that the strategy tends to rely too heavily on voluntary agreements . #% With the support of the Commission and the Council , I propose that we should devise a new category for that type of vehicle . #% A founding principle of the European Union is that religious and cultural tolerance is integral to a democratic and civilised society . #% What we should be doing this morning is looking at the positive sides of what is going on in Europe and what we can achieve outside of that situation . #% I support the restriction on fishing , while agreeing with the Commission the need to identify when bans will fall needs investigation , as yields vary with the phases of the moon and not days of the month . #% We all value economic and price stability , and the new paradigm in the United States gives us hope that such stability , including a balanced budget over the economic cycle , is consistent with growth and the steady reduction in unemployment . #% A nice TV chat by the Swedish Prime Minister would be a very good beginning and it is not good enough just to do it in this chamber . #% There is broad agreement between the Commission and all Members of this House that we should move toward alignment . #% So the first thing this House calls for is for Commissioner Bangemann , with the Parliament , to convene a meeting of the CEOs of the major car manufacturers in Europe with the components industry sector and the trade unions to see if we can put together a high-level grouping that can plan for the future of this industry . #% However , if the Commission believes that , prior to the adoption of the Financial Services Act , the British Government was not in compliance , it must say so . #% The south-east of England should benefit from such an approach . #% Inevitably , there are problems . #% I am sorry that it was not possible to get it on the agenda for this month . #% May I urge you to persevere . #% To turn such proposals into reality the understanding and support of Parliament , both as a democratic assembly and as an employing institution , will be essential . #% We have consistently backed proposals to ensure that food safety is strictly controlled within the EU . #% We gained some things for industry but lost some for the music and entertainment business . #% When I was deputy chairman of the Staffordshire Development Association two key problems emerged in dealing with small businesses . #% Mr President , in 12 days ' time our leaders meet in Hong Kong to debate the Doha Development Agenda and face the single biggest opportunity to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development Goals . #% We still have no real knowledge of who perpetrated them so I am very pleased that the Indian government is investigating it and that Pakistan is helping with that investigation . #% It strikes a balance between states -- the old and the new , the large and the small -- between citizens and the authorities and , as Mr Giscard d'Estaing has said , between dream and reality . #% Madam President , for my group this interinstitutional agreement is another building block in the re-establishment of the credibility of the European Union as regards how it handles fraud and financial mismanagement . #% An American B-52 bomber gets into trouble , the crew scramble to safety and the plane comes down in Greenland with an enormous amount of weapons-grade plutonium on board . #% There are some naked images I enjoy looking at , but I do not enjoy the visual image of lorry-loads of naked , unstamped eggs leaving foreign battery cage units en route to the UK in 2012 . #% I regret , therefore , that attempts to require the Bank to publish the names of those present , the voting on monetary actions , after a grace period of some two years and the publication of the ECB ' s econometric models were defeated at committee stage and have not been put before this House today . #% Second : What sort of message does he think this sends to the citizen of the existing Union and also of the applicant countries ? #% We now have a second reading agreement which we can all probably support . #% European Parliament representative at the Intergovernmental Conference . - Mr President , for 26 countries , the Treaty is certainly a great step forward towards European unity and certainly rivals the Treaty of Maastricht in importance . #% Let us think of the big picture and remember that the money we are giving to the accession countries represents one thousandth of the GDP of the European Union . #% Let me reiterate my appreciation that the Commission and Parliament are , for the first time , speaking with one voice on changes to Parliament 's role in important trade agreements . #% I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode . #% I also regret that the timetable has now been compressed from May to March because of the Council 's desire to have this proposal before it at Barcelona . #% But it is not in the interests of consumers , nor of the industry and , specifically , it is not in the interest of small abattoirs which would have the greatest difficulty in dealing with it . #% Mr Henderson has asked me to indicate that he apologises for not replying directly to Mr Cars , but this was a consequence of the circumstances . #% The so-called ` bra wars ' have been the unfortunate side effect of our lack of foresight and preparation . #% However , I and the PSE Group will not be able to support this resolution if that paragraph remains in place . #% With the rise in racism and anti-Semitism and the electoral success of extremist parties , this judgement boosts the fight to make Europe a society free of racism and at ease with diversity . #% Those needs are addressed in the consumer action plan 2002-2006 and in the Green Paper and its follow-up on consumer protection . #% In the long run , however , we must recognise in the European Union , as well as elsewhere , that people in the developing countries throughout the world are being driven towards support for intolerant and violent movements by the experience of increasing poverty and deprivation . #% The Commission 's reply to my questions would have stunned even a simpleton . #% There is a great deal more work to be done , but I am encouraged by what I have heard so far in response to the question tabled by myself , Mr Karas and Mr Radwan . #% We welcome the undertaking by the Afghan Interim Government to accede to the Geneva Convention banning the use of antipersonnel landmines , but the mines are still there in the ground and the victims hobble through the streets . #% The key issues are related to building peace , preventing conflict and resolving conflict . #% It states that if an agreement is largely confined to an issue of shallow integration , notably , the reduction of tariffs , there is a strong possibility of trade diversion exceeding trade creation for both parties . #% If you wish to take a split vote , all well and good , but my advice to the House is to vote both parts and to vote for them . #% Mr President , I presented the truth . #% These devastating and cowardly terrorist attacks remind us all that the scourge of terrorism is a threat faced by all democracies . #% We do this because there is a great concentration of power at the centre of the Union and it is clearly necessary for the citizen to be protected from abuse of that power . #% There is no question , Mrs Rühle , of one frustrating another . #% We have problems in the candidate countries . #% A mass meeting of the railway workers who have recently been dismissed is taking place outside , and that was where I was . #% I recognise there is a strong argument for saying that if we do not provide arms to Indonesia they will go elsewhere to buy them , to China or to Russia , for example . #% We know that there were more new infections with AIDS in 2004 than in any previous year . #% Madam President , I would like to thank my colleague , Mr Konrad , for generously giving me a minute to talk on behalf of the constituents Mr Cashman and I share in the United Kingdom , and who are affected by the uncertainty over Alstom . #% There are some areas of this report that we are unable to support , such as the CFSP text and the references to the new freedom , security and justice agenda . #% In conclusion , we feel that the Asylum Support Office could play a very valuable role in developing a common system . #% I know that . #% Like other speakers , I also represent one of the regions of the European Union which is heavily dependent on textiles , the East Midlands . #% There is not one single priority action , President Barroso , that mentions small enterprises . #% Others prefer the solution that has been tabled in an amendment signed by several political groups . #% I refer specifically to five Bosnian citizens and one legal resident who were abducted by United States agents in January 2002 , in defiance of Bosnian court orders , and held incommunicado for two years . #% At the bottom of the problem is Europe 's over-dependence on oil . #% Last month , after the defendants surrendered to the authorities , those sentences were confirmed in less than one minute without a presentation of evidence by the prosecution or defence or an examination of the witnesses . #% The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes , strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions , ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell . #% If so , that is very sad , not least for Strasbourg itself , which has absolutely no hope of getting the backing of any British Members in its future role as one of the places where the European Parliament meets . #% I am sure that the committee will -- as far as possible , as we resubmit amendments -- feel that they are important for the functioning of this legislation . #% 
I cite the placing on the TENs map of the A75 from Gretna to Stranraer , given its importance for sea transport to and from Northern Ireland . #% But this raises the fundamental debate about the clash of legal cultures which has been so central to these negotiations . #% Obviously the farmers in the UK and in my constituency where we have a suspected case are absolutely devastated by this in addition to BSE . #% When Eurorail is broken up to allow the surplus capacity to be run by different companies , we will no longer have rolling stock , just laughing stock . #% Insurance is an important issue . #% In other words port state control authorities will have to inspect certain types of ships in certain ways . #% All the health indicators show that health has been abominable for the last 23 years and there is a lack of education . #% There was no real action , in my view , to tackle transparency or unfair state aids . #% I urge the House to reaffirm its position at first reading and to exclude a form of compulsory category labelling which is entirely optional for Member States , - a form of labelling we should point out which we do not have in detail . #% However , we do not support the one-sided statement regarding the situation in the Middle East which makes no mention of the appalling terrorism against Israelis ; the unrealistic and broadly unsympathetic attitude to strong counter-terrorist measures ; or indeed the unquestioning approval of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . #% In presenting the interim report , first let me deal with two items regarding the process : one general and one particular . #% I am very pleased the Committee on Budgets has accepted our point of view and I hope the Commission does as well . #% Or is it because there are regions in other EU countries producing hugely subsidised grapes that will never produce decent wine ? #% However , this should not be seen as in any way excusing the need for this House to be fully involved in the Community 's legislative process in relation to the work of the Conference . #% No country has ever been lifted out of poverty by aid alone and countries which have enjoyed the most spectacular rates of development , such as China , have enjoyed high levels of FDI . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I share the hope that measures will be agreed at the European Council to reassure the markets and reintroduce stability to the eurozone , because , whether we are members or not , we should all have an interest in that . #% Enterprise in this sector will be stifled in the European Union and will emerge in other countries that are not hamstrung by crushing legislation . #% There are a number of applications of HFCs , from air conditioning to air-sole trainers and to aerosol fake snow , for example , which we had a little bit of fun about in the press at Christmas . #% Amendments underlining the importance of that convention are certainly welcomed by me and the EPP . #% There is an estimated global shortage of 820 000 doctors , nurses and other health workers . #% Can you assure us there is no intention for European Union states to sign bilateral immunity agreements and that you will not let this process undermine efforts to persuade the Balkan countries to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague ? #% One of the first decisions you will need to push through Council is the renewal of targeted sanctions against the ZANU-PF regime in Zimbabwe . #% Sadly , Nigeria is a country divided by ethnic and religious differences and every effort must be made by the government to build solidarity and social cohesion nationally . #% We are concerned that allowance has not been made for the entry of East Timor into the ACP-EU relationship , and we have a number of other concerns . #% I am very grateful to be able to follow my colleague , Philip Bushill-Matthews , because I share many of the concerns he has expressed . #% Mr President , I still have three concrete questions which puzzle me concerning this troublesome issue of the recruitment agency of the EU . #% May I also say that while the focus has up to now in this period of reflection been more on the context rather than on the text of the Constitution , does the Commission accept that we will in due course have to bring the debate forward to discuss what we are actually going to do about this text , maybe not this year , but certainly next year ? #% This is perhaps the first time we have been able to come to some sort of consensus on an aspect of radiation and radiation treatment . #% Security of supply is about keeping the lights on . #% The third aspect is the CFSP . #% Both sides have violated the ceasefire . #% One is the relationship between alcohol and accidents . #% Well , here we are , over halfway through , and what do we have ? #% This report has been discussed several times in committee and was adopted by a large majority at the end of November . #% In Africa , services represent 52 % of GDP and rising compared to 16 % for agriculture . #% I tabled many amendments amounting to hundreds of millions of euros . #% Where are those young people going to come from ? #% Sadly , from what I have heard today , a similar commitment from the Council of Ministers seems to be a good way off . #% The European Parliament , which has to approve such agreements , will watch with close attention . #% I agree with him completely , for example , that it is a nonsense to say that the airlines will not cope . #% I recall that when the urban waste water directive went through , the impact assessment was very feeble and never really gave any figures as to the likely costs . #% Most other CAP sectors have been fully decoupled and we see no reason why such a glaring exception was made for tobacco , a product that kills hundreds of thousands of EU citizens each year . #% Europe needs to crack down on the trade in trafficking human beings . #% It would be a distortion of a market that has worked well for a very long time . #% I am asking the Commission to clarify that it is a figure of about EUR 5.5 billion we are talking about when we talk about the aid that is needed for Kosovo and the Balkans in the light of what President Prodi and Commissioner Patten said . #% I would like to ask , will Commissioner Marin use the influence he clearly has to pressurize the ASEAN countries to play a more constructive role ? #% We can not avoid these uncomfortable truths . #% Mr President , my group also wishes to congratulate the Taoiseach and his team for their prize-winning presidency : canny , courageous and committed . #% Incrementally it has transformed the European Community of 1984 into the quite different European Union that we have today , a Union with a wider scope of responsibility , with at least partially more effective institutions and with greater democratic accountability . #% It would be helpful . #% The measures to improve the Stability and Growth Pact , surveillance and the European semester all aim at prevention of another crisis and serve to monitor emergence from the current economic crisis . #% One amendment seeks to re-establish in the report a request that the IGC should re-examine the issue of flexible cooperation . #% My opposition to the Constitution currently is not based on dogma , but it is known -- as far as I am aware -- that it would not be good for the people of Europe . #% He has done a good job over a relatively short period of time . #% Finally , we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements , because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry . #% If you set out from Cornwall and try to get to Florida in a canoe , you are turning the entire Atlantic into recreational water and I do not think that is worth it . #% Will not bananas otherwise constitute a precedent for other products of other less-developed countries to lose their outlets , and will that not raise , in the long term , the issue of amendments to the world trade system to protect the poor against the multinationals ? #% It is not so secret - most Members , including myself , have a copy . #% How can BP argue that it is not compromised when strike action against them is directly broken up by the military forces , including the documented murder of Carlos Mesías Arrigui and at least three further killings reported directly to us in the last month ? #% I suspect that would not come up with such a result but , nevertheless , can I ask you whether you will look into the possibility of commissioning a study or encouraging the Commission itself to study the Tobin-type taxes , so as to see whether they are feasible and under what conditions they could work ? #% Tonight , as we draw towards the close of that presidency , I want to commend the Finnish Presidency for working on this , but also to express some disappointment that it has not made more of the opportunities . #% We are voting on a new structure and then we will be voting for 10 , 15 or 25 countries , depending on the way you look at it . #% Leaked drafts resemble nothing so much as a plan for unopposed invasion . #% Mr President , we have a huge and inexcusable gap in EU action . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I look forward to this debate , and particularly to hearing from those who are not so keen on enhancing transparency and public access to documents . #% Sadly , I found the document vague , indicative of a lack of any real action over past years , although there were some notable exceptions . #% 
Hence the many amendments proposed by the committee . #% Europe 's viewers , not the politicians , will deal the knock-out blow to this pipedream project , because ordinary people know that if the EU is the answer , then it must have been a stupid question . #% I can remember sitting here six , seven and eight years ago , talking about these issues . #% I would like to remind everybody that the world around us is changing technologically , socially ( although manners may not be changing ) , scientifically , and , as we can see in this report , biomedically . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I would be grateful if you could add my time to the time that I was given before , so that , on behalf of the ALDE Group , we have two minutes . #% As others have said , it is a question , sometimes , of how you spend the money . #% This report has the potential positively to affect a broad number of issues : it could enhance the lives of people working on board ships and , moreover , it is in line with the EU 's attempts to take a pioneering role in protecting the environment . #% . Mr President , the main concern of the Committee on Development and Cooperation in relation to this agreement is to make sure that its impact is in keeping with the wider development goals of the Union . #% There is no real reason for the state to be involved . #% The resolution identifies some structural changes at EU level which could genuinely improve enforcement of human rights , including better operation of the human rights clause between the EU and third countries , inclusion of the European Parliament in discussion of the operational programme on human rights , and the introduction of benchmarks which enable EU action short of the two often blunt instruments of sanctions policies or suspension of aid . #% But it is still bad legislation in its provisional extension to include the self-employed . #% Several speakers have blamed the Stability and Growth Pact . #% In particular , it took the loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise , the Scandinavian Star and , most tragic of all , the Estonia , before ferry companies and governments started to come to terms with the consequences of their negligence . #% Mr President , I want to add to what my colleague , Mr Falconer has said . #% Normally this Parliament is consulted on a Commission proposal . #% First of all , on enlargement , we are talking here about enlargement of a very different scale and nature to anything that has happened before , and that has implications for the nature of the IGC which prepares for it . #% That question of appraisal links very strongly to an aspect of the reforms about which we know you are engaged in heavy discussions at the moment . #% However , from the beginning when Members raised the issue of linking the Financial Perspective with a new system of own resources , I have used the phrase `` get real '' on at least three occasions . #% I am also painfully aware that my own constituency in the east of England contains a major part of the UK 's sugar farming . #% However , even the coke-sniffing youngsters at the credit agencies know that Ireland , Greece , Spain , Italy , the United Kingdom and Portugal are broke . #% As to how we solve those difficulties , we could look to social partner agreements or re-rostering arrangements that have been put in place in certain parts of the EU to deal with the implications of those cases . #% We have proved that 99.9 % of Members of the European Parliament are capable of keeping up with the technological skills of their children . #% It would appear that the Spanish authorities are running rings around the European laws and this is a quite disgraceful state of affairs . #% The belief traditionally fostered by the pharmaceutical companies has been that patents are sacrosanct . #% Finally , on a lighter note , much of this may seem to be remote to Europe 's citizens whose support is essential to our partnership with Africa . #% The objections to doping are threefold . #% All of this gives the Agency a forum in the public domain to make its voice heard on issues of its choice . #% To encourage him , much more needs to be done to increase the pressure on his military dictatorship in Burma . #% So far so good , with little inflationary rounding-up . #% It is also an attack - in which , if I may say so , the Group of the Greens is also involved - upon my constituents in the north-west and everyone else who works in this most important and significant industry both in Britain and in other parts of the Union . #% Lastly , I welcome , as Commissioner Borg mentioned , the TACIS EUR 2 million dedicated to free broadcasting in Belarus and supporting civil society . #% It may well be a useful idea to think of continuing this on an annual basis , because where we have gained is looking at the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations of the European institutions , and this for us in Parliament is a point of major importance which I shall come back to at the end of my speech . #% I do hope you think it is worthwhile getting up that early . #% Therefore it does not have the ability to carry out that task effectively . #% I would like to see not only the country but also the region of origin on the label . #% That is why I want to follow what Mrs Haug said about these agencies . #% We are already a large donor to UNHCR and if we are going to ask more of it , we will need to take that into account . #% I will confine my remarks mainly to the report on the service of documents . #% There are many concerns about energy consumption and electricity generation in the applicant countries , which need to be addressed . #% I am the first to understand that Europe 's relationship with ASEAN is widely based and most important . #% We are facing extinction and you have a body which is set up supposedly to look after the tuna ! #% In the dioxin scandal , for example , what is needed , it seems to me , is not so much a mad rush to ban a whole range of products - RVOs and so on - as the possibility of discovering whether these things are new pollutants or simply products which have become polluted . #% Surely Cuba is more likely to move towards a more democratic form of government through strengthened trade links with democratic countries and being readmitted to the mainstream rather than being regarded as a pariah state ? #% The British government made a similar declaration in June 1999 hoping that a way could be found to get agreement on the inclusion of terrorist acts in the future . #% Finally , may I make a direct appeal to Commissioner Vitorino to ensure that organisations acting in the field of raising justice standards , such as the admirable Fair Trials Abroad , can be assisted under the Community budget . #% For these reasons the British Conservatives have abstained on the final vote on the Ferber report . #% I particularly want to take up the point that was raised about the fact that , while it is a Transport and Tourism Committee , only about five per cent of our workload concerns the tourism sector . #% Finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed . #% We ought to stress that this Parliament wants more say in what happens in these agreements . #% I echo the words of Mr Rönnholm on that . #% The European Union can , and should , play its full part within this region . #% That seems to suggest to me that we can use decrease in efficiency methods or physical methods to actually achieve MAGP targets . #% It is an important proposal because it introduces a more formal structure into the process of Parliament 's scrutiny of the Commission 's legislative programme , which is , after all , a very important component of one of our most important functions - that is to say , scrutinising and holding the Commission to account . #% Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate the Swedish presidency on a very successful first presidency of the Union . #% He will be aware that the Court of Justice delivered a judgment early in November which clearly stated that the Commission and the Council had proceeded correctly in this matter and that the European Parliament had been duly consulted . #% They realise that having the infrastructure in place is going to open up great opportunities for their own economies and for trade globally . #% The importance of assisting developing countries to monitor fishing activities in their own waters must also be stressed . #% I hope that , when the summit meeting is held between Europe and the United States within the next few weeks , the President-in-Office of the Council will stress the fact that we urgently need a new round of world trade negotiations . #% Space and security and defence policy would of course require a common communication system , and the report underlines the necessity for Galileo to be used for an autonomous European security and defence policy . #% Madam President , as the rapporteur alluded , this report has had something of a troubled life : it has been rather problematic and been back and forth to the Council . #% With Mr Haider and Mr Le Pen lurking in the background , the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento Sociale Fiamma Tricolore promoting racism and xenophobia , the PPE Group , as a whole , should not be surprised if people conclude that if they continue with their technical objections , then this is a thinly disguised attempt to block these proposals which the vast majority of Europe so much welcomes . #% In other words it is not terribly satisfactory but at least it is better than the original proposal from the Commission , and the amendment by the Socialist Group which I hope will not be supported tomorrow . #% That means having rules that are observed , for them as well as for us . #% Finally , and more generally , I would like to reiterate the rapporteur 's general conclusion that this is all far too difficult and complicated for anyone other than an expert or a lawyer and every effort must be made to simplify the law and make it more user-friendly so that the single market is understood by all our citizens . #% The French president , for instance , can dissolve parliament . #% The witnesses have been extremely forthcoming and cooperative with the Committee of Inquiry . #% 
This is killing so many millions of people , especially young children , and I do not think that we would wish to neglect sending a very clear message that they must now at last resolve the issue of world debt and the way it is affecting young children in particular in the Third World . #% So perhaps we would do well in this House to look at how we talk about issues such as the repatriation of profit to countries producing it , rather than simply extracting the cash as well as the natural resources . #% The most recent opinion poll in Belgium -- or should I say in Flanders -- shows that 51 % of people there favour independence from the Belgian state . #% On the other hand , if this House actually prevented some of the more insane regulations created by the Commission from reaching the statute books , thus slowing down the growing burdens on business , there might be an economic argument for MEPs . #% This is perverse and it is in all our interests to address the problem . #% In adopting Mr Miller 's report , therefore , this House would need to confirm that its participation in an early retirement scheme will be subject to the same conditions as those applied by the Council and by the Commission . #% None of them seemed to be under any illusion about the work that needs to be done , or indeed the urgency of addressing the areas that have been highlighted by the Commission and the Parliament as being still of serious concern . #% And I fear we must ask the Commission to take its proposal away and start again . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , like many others , I think we are here with a deep sense of regret and a certain feeling of anger that , once again , we are having to discuss the situation in Pakistan . #% Was it the Chief Accountant at the time ? #% These measures include training of judicial officials , prison officers and gendarmes , ensuring first-class medical services , improving conditions for prison visits and installing the independent scrutiny of the prison system and protecting lawyers . #% Mr President , I rise in respect of the Minutes and the remark which is reported from my colleague Mr David who said that my complaint to you at the beginning of the week was made in a personal capacity . #% Certainly , in any event , we do not wish to see an extension of the Geneva Convention of 1951 in terms of the criteria it sets out on asylum , however worthy the cause may be . #% Mr President , the European Parliament has produced a comic strip book , entitled Troubled Waters , to inform young people about the workings of the European Parliament . #% This report refutes those arguments . #% Since the Commission has those three options I really think the word ` possibly ' should disappear . #% These reports give , as the House knows , an annual record of the work of the Commission in discharging one of the most vital parts of its role as guardian of the Treaties by taking action against infringements under Article 226 of the Treaty . #% We have listened to the concerns of people across Europe calling for the right to make an informed choice about GM food . #% I insist that this matter now be referred to the Bureau and that , as of September , we see no further repetition . #% We can afford these increases , but that is not the point . #% In his question the honourable Member is probably referring to actions 57 and 58 of the Reform Strategy Action Plan which , amongst other things , specifies commitment to making proposals for the establishment of an interinstitutional disciplinary board . #% Then we in Parliament have insisted on the definition of the roles and responsibilities of a full list of players -- stakeholders , if you will -- in the electricity supply industry . #% For example , while we strongly support a ban on the horrendous exploitation and abuse of children as child soldiers in countries such as Uganda and Sierra Leone , we can not support a ban on the recruitment of soldiers under 18 in our own countries . #% Elmar Brok proposed that responsibility be transferred from the Bureau , which meets in private , to the Parliament , which meets in public . #% I hasten to add this is not a threat - though that may sound like a contradiction of something I have to say a little later on . #% Exactly how much is the EU expecting the British taxpayer to pay , and is this legal ? #% LIFE money was also found to be involved in substantial land purchases where there were insufficient guarantees that this land would continue to be used for nature conservation purposes once the implementation period for the actions was over . #% Mr President , I want to welcome the Commission proposal this evening and to recognise the work done by Mr Amadeo in producing a very well thought-out report . #% Furthermore , best practice in the open coordination method should not be seen as a substitute for the Geneva Convention and the relevant Protocol thereto . #% Secondly , I want to emphasise the need to maintain flexibility for Member States . #% Madam President , I speak not only on behalf of my group but as chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee with the Czech Republic and as someone who believes that the reintegration of Europe is both a duty and a joy . #% Apart from keeping the technocrats busy with yet more interference in other people 's lives , there is no need for additional law in this sphere . #% It will be absolutely essential after the genocide laws have been passed that the trials begin in January . #% The international community at some point will tell you where to get off - perhaps not just quite yet . #% I shall concentrate today on two issues where we can make a real difference this year . #% I do not use those as an excuse . #% Perhaps more significantly , what signal does this send to potential enemies ? #% All this threatens the whole credibility of the World Trade Organisation and any chance we have of believing in the developments at Doha , or if we ever have a new round of fair , multilateral trading systems . #% The financial package may require adaptation in the light of changes to the overall financial perspective and I am reassured by the Commission 's recognition that cooperation with Parliament , as one arm of the Union 's budgetary authority , will therefore need to be intensified over the next three years . #% What is a common foreign policy and what is it trying to achieve ? #% Looking at the reductions made in Category 3 , there are many areas where we will disagree and agree to disagree . #% This analysis is a modest but useful step in that direction . #% Now when that is the situation , how can we say that the proposal , welcome as it is , to look at a Europe-wide Food and Drugs Agency and all these grand gestures can work when no individual inspector can penetrate into the world of crime and fraud which characterises sections of this industry . #% Since then , the Europhile British press , particularly the national Sunday newspaper The Observer , has made great capital over the recent tragic collision between the Swiss and the Russian airliners . #% You may recall that Parliament put a very strong emphasis on the need for a positive outcome from this ICAO meeting . #% But when Member States do receive that aid from the European Union under this provision , they should be encouraged to spend it in a way that respects the principles of the Union - in other words , not ignoring the need for social protection and social inclusion . #% Mr Pirker , you said a few minutes ago that if you voted in favour of this report , you would be against the health of our young people . #% HFCs are a drop in the ocean in relation to CO2 . #% In the ECR , we want the euro to be a success for the sake both of those who choose to join and of those in the wider European economy , but this requires Member States to take their responsibilities seriously , to be honest with each other , and to fulfil their agreed commitments . #% To demand membership of the WHO for Taiwan is to recognise it as a nation state ; to grant it an independence that its own government has not even requested . #% But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper , perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index , you would still have the portfolio and the shares , but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse . #% Mr President , I think we should establish from the outset that the reasons why this lucrative illegal trade is flourishing are exactly the same as those at the root of both the illegal narcotics trade and of illegal arms trading . #% I would just say in passing to Dr Matsakis , whom I greatly esteem , that I do not share his relative happiness with the outcome of the events of 1918 . #% Madam President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to welcome this resolution . #% According to the agenda , this debate was scheduled to start at 10.30 . #% We said , crucially , that if ICAO did not deliver what we need then the EU will have to seriously consider adopting its own complementary measures to ensure that environmental concerns are more properly integrated into the aviation industry . #% Whatever the eventual choice , speaking personally as a consumer rather than a legislator , I would make one plea for the use of some clearly identifiable common symbol , comparable to the CE mark currently employed , where we have harmonised rules concerning the health and safety of products . #% Russia and China - and nobody has criticised Russia and China on the other side of the House - have also refused to sign the statute for good reasons . #% I wish you well and congratulate you on your presidency , but I also ask you specifically to press these points with the United States of America . #% They do nothing of the sort . #% No fewer than 385 , 000 tonnes of the stuff ! #% I can assure you that people seeking crêpes suzettes or the people who used to earn their living making them in the United Kingdom are now out of a job and that Brussels is being blamed . #% We liked the approach that the Commission put forward in its proposal and we will not let go in terms of ensuring that , if agencies are to exist , they must be properly accountable to the elected institutions of the European Union and not go off on a tangent by themselves . #% We expected to hear something -- at least a memorandum -- from Mr Berlusconi , as he seems to have spoken on every other subject recently , and from Mr Blair . #% What is the logic of that ? #% I do not think we can afford to wait another six years before we act , so good use could be made of the period 2008-2012 by running at least a pilot scheme . #% 
In my view , if the EU really is interested in raising the game , it could start by asking for less money , not more , and it should initiate a major study on the means necessary to return the powers it has taken from democratically elected governments . #% If we can deal first with the consumer health policy unit as covered in the SAB , I think that following the conclusions of the first committee inquiry it was quite clear that there was a need for real action to be taken on food safety at EU level . #% Mr President , as the shadow rapporteur on the Legal Affairs Committee working with my colleague Mrs Berger , I would like to thank our colleagues on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for accepting so many amendments from our committee . #% In some cases , these measures should be renewable and temporary . #% This is a highly tense situation and it is not helped by Eritrea 's eviction of members of the UN mission . #% The European Union with the support of this Parliament has already done much to raise the technical and operational safety of Soviet-type nuclear reactors and to create independent regulators . #% In particular we were disappointed that the target for energy-efficiency savings has been set at only 9 % over 9 years , instead of the 11.5 % proposed by Parliament at first reading . #% However , we are now apparently refusing to set boundaries on the role of the market in relation to the right of Member States to decide on the method , financing and scope of the health services they provide . #% They extend , in the Commission ' s view , to the massive outflow of capital from Russia which has in turn obviously contributed to the low level of internal investment and therefore impeded economic growth . #% In his conclusion he said `` Europe will be dynamic if we make it loved by those it serves '' . #% I am sure that all sides of the House desire that outcome strongly . #% Even at the second reading it did not put money on the line - we did . #% The Convention itself , in several Council acts , lays down rules on the use of data and the communication of that data to third states and bodies . #% I have even more concern about and difficulty with proposals to use reserves to intervene in the market for purposes of price-smoothing , when experience shows - and recent experience in the United States in particular shows - that it does not work . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Verhofstadt for reminding us all of the failure of left-wing economic policies in the United Kingdom . #% This report was adopted in committee by an overwhelming majority of 47 to 1 without amendment . #% In the single market it has to co-exist with other products and it has to do so in a manner consistent with our international obligations . #% Nothing will be certain in the weeks ahead , we must act now to reduce the risks around the world and I welcome the contribution this resolution will make to the process . #% We would devalue our own stance if we thought that the technical standards had not been met , because we voted to support that visa waiver . #% Quite frankly , it was a pathetic performance on that trialogue to get a conclusion to this decision , which really involved a small amount of money . #% Could the President-in-Office comment , please . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report , which I believe to be an extremely important piece of work . #% What is the presidency doing , or what proposals does it have , to improve the quality of between different agencies within Member States and across borders ? #% In an increasingly interdependent world , where modern economics propelled by science , technology and improved transport systems breaks down the significance of national boundaries and with them the practical relevance of ringfenced national jurisdiction , the democratic political process must not get left behind . #% The pay gap between men and women full-time workers has narrowed in the last twenty years , but only very slowly . #% Europe with its richness of linguistic diversity presents problems as well as strengths . #% Secondly , a person can move to another Member State in order to undergo treatment , but should obtain the prior authorization of the competent sickness institution , that is , form E112 , in order to be properly reimbursed . #% All decisions subsequently taken have been communicated to all shadow rapporteurs and all political groups . #% This is not due to safety concerns or the attractiveness of the product : it is all about the profits that go into this business . #% Across Europe , there is consensus among governments and people alike that we must fight to eradicate poverty . #% I am sure this House will wish to express its encouragement and support for the peace process . #% Strong mechanisms to prevent corruption and misuse of EU money are , however , fundamental and we should also be careful not to force our own western liberal values , in particular , so-called reproductory rights , on to others ill-equipped or reluctant to absorb them under the guise of human rights . #% The problem has been recognised and identified across the whole of Europe . #% In Parliament we have the Petitions Committee and the Officer of the Ombudsman to oversee allegations of maladministration . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , Airbus , Alcatel , Lucent and Delphi Systems are just the latest in a never-ending stream of instances of major restructuring that have led delegations of workers to come to us complaining of breaches of EU information and consultation laws , not just the Works Council Directive , but others too : directives on collective redundancies and transfers dating from the 1970s , and the Directive establishing a General Framework for Information and Consultation of Workers . #% More paperwork will mean more bureaucratic delay and will certainly reduce the likelihood that our programmes will be properly prepared or properly targeted . #% I am told that at the moment it only applies to those products derived from soya and maize . #% History will catch up with you . #% I have always said that , if the EU is the answer , it must have been a silly question . #% That report was called for by European ministers to provide an overview of relevant existing agreements and to provide further recommendations . #% In a world where surely less regulation is the key , we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union , untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens . #% We do not know what has happened to them . #% I am sure that the overwhelming majority in the European Parliament will back the resolution that has been put before us . #% I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and , if so , whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so . #% Secondly , the world 's major proliferation in the past decades has not been Pyongyang but Pakistan . #% For nearly 30 years the enclaved Greek Cypriot communities in the northern part of Cyprus have been denied secondary schooling for their children . #% We need guarantees of freedom of movement on the ground as well as in the air . #% The ruling has been made , whether we like it or not . #% I urged them then , and I urge them again today , to take part in the parliamentary elections on 17 July . #% Given that every Member State is already a signatory to the convention , what benefit is there to the EU signing as well ? #% I also welcome the undertaking to explore alternatives for delivering the project , but I am alarmed at the possibility of an interim solution dependent on the public purse . #% Mr President , can I first of all of behalf of the whole House thank the President of the Ecofin Council for his presentation today and more importantly , for the way in which he has engaged the European Parliament in dialogue since the Irish took over the presidency of the European Union . #% I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling . #% If we get more of them back to work and more companies started , that is the biggest single social achievement that we will make with this act . #% Our information is that in regard to contaminated pork - to pigs that had been fed with these appalling materials - four Member States had purchased and no doubt their citizens had consumed some of the contaminated pork before the process of control was effectively operating . #% Last year we received 958 petitions of which 492 were considered admissible . #% Could you now say that the disciplinary process against your former chief accountant will stop and she will be brought in to drive through these reforms that she told you you needed this time last year ? #% On this one , the Commission has failed miserably . #% The principles in supporting this directive are clear . #% The Commission must therefore justify its decision in far greater detail than it has previously done and give good explanations for its motivation and thinking in arriving at that decision when it did . #% Mr President , there are two messages coming from this House today . #% In the last six months , there have apparently been seven official executions in which individuals convicted by an Iranian court have been stoned to death . #% Central to the solutions that he is proposing is the food agency . #% These restrictions , the kind of things we have heard about from the Commission , will simply have no effect on the SLORC whatsoever . #% I would add that , since we are all concerned about candidate selection , quoting from the Conservative Party 's own manual on candidate selection , it says : ' Edmund Burke 's words still hold good today . #% Let me read out his ruling : `` In the present case the Commission has not provided the Ombudsman with elements which show that EUROSTAT , when deciding not to classify the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region , has taken into account all relevant factors including Article 158 of the Treaty and the Viola report of the European Parliament '' . #% 
I am very conscious of the issue already mentioned by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , that if we try too hard to set very tight limits , many Member States fear that we will be dictating their energy policy to them , which , of course , is not our right as a Parliament . #% It is not just about the influence of mental health on employment , but the effect of employment on mental health . #% This is a dangerous mixture that threatens us all . #% We should now , in the light of the report of violence against the people of Western Sahara , give the UN mission there a mandate to monitor the human rights of the Sahrawi people . #% While it is certainly true the developing countries asserted themselves in a much stronger way than ever before - and that is to be commended - it is also true that the outcome from Doha falls far short of the development round which was promised us . #% There are a lot of things that irritate our citizens about the EU when it is perceived to be imposing new rules or removing ancient rights without justification . #% He was subjected , and I say subjected with good reason , to the fast-track trial procedure last year , and was convicted : it was then deemed to be unfair and he went for retrial last month . #% This issue is going to affect the lives of every citizen in the European Union . #% Could you give me your analysis of what stage one part of your work will take over from the other in the case of Sierra Leone ? #% Much of what we are hearing this morning is based on the concept of a benevolent state . #% Of course Parliament will , this year and every year , offer constructive criticism . #% Since the Cuban Government wants a cooperative agreement and numerous European Union Member States have trading agreements with Cuba , why can not we achieve an agreement on this basis ? #% The Socialist group recognizes the tremendous efforts made by the British Foreign Secretary and the British Prime Minister to restart that process and to carry out the conclusions of Luxembourg , particularly in drawing to the attention of the Israeli Government the lack of wisdom in proceeding with these settlements and of the need to develop economic strategy on the Palestinian side . #% How can Austrian leaders show such total disregard for public opinion ? #% We will face rising unemployment and falling demand . #% The rapporteur said that the opt-out violates the fundamental principles of the Treaty . #% It is essential that the policy chapters are susceptible to a softer form of revision than the existing unanimity , plus national ratification in all Member States . #% These efforts by the Commission will continue . #% Those are the things we were looking at and it has been rejected by members of the PPE-DE Group . #% We know to our cost that Russia sometimes follows its own rule book in international affairs . #% It reminds us that individuals throughout the world , because they are different , because of where they were born , to whom they were born , are not given those universal freedoms that we so often take for granted . #% It is inevitable that the policies , strategies and coordination of ECHO will be damaged by these proposals . #% But again , they have to ensure implementation of the single market , particularly as regards counterfeiting in the audiovisual sector . #% We have to realize that it is not just simply a question of CO2 : there are other greenhouse gases that we must deal with ; they have to be part of the treaty . #% We do not want to live in a Community which unreasonably restricts the entry of outsiders . #% We have had our discussions on the 2001 budget on that particular matter , and will certainly be looking to have these proposals applied within Parliament if possible . #% I regret that the Council can not yet uphold the proposed legal base and live up to the hopes it has raised in the EU 's so-called `` 16th Member State '' of third-country nationals and among those of us who wish to see them treated fairly and equally . #% Was Portugal going to fight Italy in the mid-1970s ? #% However , unfortunately , in total , the report suffers from both a lack of balance and the sins of omission . #% Unfortunately , too often competitiveness in the EU is too often taken to mean that every nation and every company has to suffer under the same regulatory burden or the same ` level playing field ' . #% I want the principle to be accepted . #% Let me quote Mrs Dührkop Dührkop in her report on this . #% After our years of effort to that end , we can now justifiably say to the Community as a whole that what we want for ourselves we want for everyone else as well . #% Last year Parliament voted to allocate resources to help address the continuing health problems in the Republic of Belarus as a direct result of the Chernobyl incident of April 1986 . #% What they do worst is to second-guess the legislative powers of the European Parliament . #% We understand that , of the principal tests , roughly one-third can now be done by alternative methods , one-third are modified and one-third await effective resolution . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Cox both on his report and his explanation of it here , in this Chamber . #% These proposals will put a lucrative spy beaming up to Galileo in every trucker 's cab . #% We recognise the pressures on the budget - whether it is the Balkans , Palestine , enlargement , Afghanistan or the demand for action in new fields of activity . #% Mr President , I am glad that we now can have a full debate on this important subject . #% As it transpires , this letter has never turned up , and that is a great shame because the European Central Bank should not really fear criticism from this institution . #% These include , paragraph 3 , which may be seen to suggest that the EU is not fully respecting the decision of the Irish people in their referendum to reject the Nice Treaty ; paragraph 6 which recommends a controversial Convention model to take the negotiations forward to the next IGC ; paragraph 25 which supports the tax package involving tax harmonisation and a withholding tax ; paragraph 26 which recommends social-chapter-inspired works council measures ; and paragraphs 33 and 34 which are supportive of an independent ESDP which could decouple us from NATO . #% So far , we have not had this report and I emphasise here the concerns of my colleague Mrs Morgan . #% Liberalisation of the passenger side must proceed step by step . #% No democrat could disagree . #% In addition , the Commission would like to see a speedy resolution of the problems in the Russian banking system , which is obviously at the centre of concerns about corruption . #% It is no good claiming that in other areas the UN has been less rigorous . #% First of all , could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday . #% I have also been sceptical at times as to the real determination of President Musharraf , ostensibly our ally in the war on terrorism , to really stamp out radical Islamist Jahadis and stop youngsters , including EU citizens , being educated in the hardline Deobandi madrassas . #% The British armed forces are world class but they have been desperately over-stretched over the past year . #% I am interested in what you say . #% It is also essential for the defence industry itself , because the lack of a code of conduct is holding back the consolidation which the industry needs and which will make it less dependent on exports , as I pointed out in my report to this Parliament a few months ago . #% Secondly , the single European market . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Conservative delegation and my European Democrat colleagues , can I welcome the Prime Minister and say that we hope the British presidency will indeed be a truly reforming one . #% If this is not done so by the end of the current term of the Commission and Parliament , we will be in breach of the commitments we made to our electorate to ensure that real institutional reforms are carried out . #% We have supported all efforts to strengthen the place of developing countries in the world trade system , not least by underlining the inescapable need for continued reform of the EU ' s common agricultural policy . #% There is no safe drug abuse , it is a question of how we reduce and prevent the harm that arises from such abuse . #% Secondly , one of the areas of concern has been the quality of implementation in the Stability Pact . #% It is extraordinary that the European Union should still have governments wedded to an outdated protectionist mentality and the promotion of economic and industrial patriotism . #% We have to look at vaccines that are available , because it must not be forgotten that this disease can mutate into several different viruses . #% Would the Commissioner , because of the problems of certain suckler herds - grass-fed beef which has never , ever been in contact with the food that is tainted - consider a top-up in the beef suckler premium scheme or the suckler cow scheme to actually help them in the future ? #% We want those choices to reward companies that provide quality , value and outstanding customer service and we want to make sure that the framework of regulation does not discourage innovation ; it must actually encourage innovative companies . #% This is an atrocity that will appal the whole House and the European Union . #% If today , for example , a Latvian financial services company started conducting business all over the European Union , it seems each Member State would assume that the Latvian Government was itself satisfied , but that would not necessarily be the case . #% It is they that are going to have to deliver and we are going to be keeping an eye on them to make sure they do deliver . #% They can tell the difference between different varieties of chocolate and they have to be allowed to decide for themselves . #% 
Mr President , it has been a stimulating debate so far and I particularly appreciated the contribution from Mr Miller who demonstrated very clearly the point made by the rapporteur , in his excellent report , that vendor control is simply not working . #% We argue against this in the resolution , because the time is not yet ripe . #% Mr President , I agree that the report as it stands is now admissible , but that is because changes were made that I and Parliament 's services asked for and which the services upheld . #% Mr President , I agree with the Commissioner when he said on opening this debate that restructuring is necessary so that activity which is no longer sufficiently productive can be cut back . #% But logic is not necessarily sufficient . #% That union has informed the debate about the future of the textile industry . #% Is he wanting us to sympathize with him in the plight that is caused by this postponement ? #% We must not bring them home until there is more security in the country . #% Within that framework there is clearly a choice of instruments for putting the single market in place which can be described as the choice between harmonization and mutual recognition . #% That is a recognition of our dual role . #% So , if I may , let me give one tip to the consumer : ` never a lender or a borrower be ' , and to governments , let me say : ' a fool and his money are soon parted ' ! #% It is at that point that Ecofin will become dominant and will hamstring the other two Councils . #% Therefore , British Conservatives abstained on this report . #% author . - Madam President , the tropical rainforests in Cameroon and the Congo are precious and we must welcome this voluntary agreement to address the sustainability of the harvesting of the timber that they contain . #% In particular , I thank them for allowing the committee to visit Northumberland , in my region , where the disease originated . #% Our armies should not be recruited to the process of political integration , dressed up in other clothes . #% It is incumbent upon Parliament to make certain that the safety precautions which we have been forced to take are now common practice throughout the European Union as a whole . #% In doing this I declare an interest in that one of these diseases is to be found within my family . #% In view of the latest Commission scandals we must make sure that this project is not tainted by any doubts about how the money is managed . #% I am advised that the final part of Amendment 5 , which refers to the fact that ` ... Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner shares this concern ' would read better as ` ... this is a view shared by many international bodies ' . #% I also wish to congratulate the Council on being able to establish at the last summit the principle of the headline goals . #% I wish to say that on 25 September 2003 Parliament passed a resolution requiring the Commission to answer certain questions on the regulation of Lloyd 's of London and to give information by 15 November 2003 . #% In conclusion , I should like to thank my colleagues from my own and other groups for their help and support for this report and for their cooperation . #% Russia has to recognise who her real friends are . #% How can the Council trust us and take us seriously if we are incapable of making coherent recommendations and produce urgencies which are inaccurate and contradictory ? #% Europe needs economic reform , public finance discipline , deepening the internal market , changes to labour laws to boost employment , and a package of measures to make a success of the Europe 2020 programme . #% You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash , but that would be to waste your research into the winners . #% On a final note , we talk a lot in this House about the importance of consumer choice and prevention in public health . #% But , democratically , Germany , learning from its history , has decided that there should be a law about the denial of the holocaust . #% For Liberals individuals have the fundamental right to seek to become millionaires or to seek to create a large business or to live in a mansion , but individuals do not have the fundamental rights to live free from poverty , to have a job or to reside in decent housing . #% Will any liaison be established with those animal welfare organizations which so far , apparently , are the only ones to have exposed the cruelty of this trade ? #% Personally , I am convinced of the need for regime change , ideally via Saddam 's exile or , failing that , by military intervention , as the only way to ensure a disarmed and peaceful Iraq . #% Finally , I agree with the rapporteur that we must eliminate the possibility of air transport following sea transport and using flags of convenience for ships and crews . #% One could also mention the devastating floods in Bangladesh in July . #% Mr President , you have your responsibilities , but you and your services are in danger of being subverted . #% The guidelines need to be strengthened and refocused and there is a lot of work both to do and to undo in this House in order to give more impetus to the Lisbon process . #% These themes also dominated or sought to hijack the intergovernmental conference . #% The clearest manifestation of this is the Pakistani Taliban , a terrorist movement whose intentions were again made only too clear recently in the , mercifully failed , Times Square bomb plot in New York . #% Let us not get this debate mixed up with tomorrow ' s debate on the supplementary and amending budgets 1 , 3 and 4 for 1999 because , when the President-in-Office says that this spirit of cooperation is based on mutual trust ( that is what I wrote down ) between the institutions , I only have to remind the Council of what it did with supplementary and amending budgets 1 and 3 and our reaction to it . #% This proposal deals with those environmental industrial problems . #% Mr Byrne said that he was against any proposal that would control imports from countries where FMD is endemic . #% But what I would greatly appreciate from the Presidency is a statement of how precisely they plan to do this , because in the various treaties we have had recently and the European Councils , there has been no suggestion of how this might be achieved . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs very much for their good collaboration on this report . #% You , the Commission , have the primary responsibility , and I wish in a way that we did not have to have this debate in this style every year . #% Firstly I want us to express our condolences to and solidarity with all those who have suffered bereavement , injury and loss . #% I echo her words of praise for the Economic and Social Committee , from whom I have learnt a great deal in the course of our discussions . #% At this stage , this unnecessary step would add to the sizeable list of existing airport taxes , security charges and other duties that they are already forced to pay . #% We must make sure that where the market is merged we have regulations and a legislative framework to recognise that . #% Only a small fraction of the structural demands are aimed at innovatory projects . #% As co-rapporteur on this topic , I am helping to prepare a submission from this Parliament to the Supreme Court , but only the Council can make representations on behalf of the EU as a whole . #% Changes in the composition of the labour force , new forms of work organisation , the restructuring of social protection , changes in the distribution of caring work between women and men , all have a very important bearing on the lives of single parent families and , in particular , single mothers . #% Most of all , what should have been done is that we should have stopped the possibility of such a disaster again . #% That is why our resolution supports lifting it . #% I fully accept , as does my Group , that the major goal for this budget as set out by Mr Mulder is enlargement . #% Just recently a gay man was killed purely out of murderous prejudice . #% The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation , to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water . #% This would be a centre to gather information and intelligence from all possible partners and actors , business itself , institutions of higher and further education , the employment services both public and private , the social partners from all relevant actors and again I would say to Mr Chichester , we are not saying here that governments should try to predict change . #% For my own constituency of course , Aberdeen Angus beef is already justly renowned throughout the world but I am sure the same is true for other regions in the rest of the UK and other Member States . #% It is very important that what we are doing here is seen and publicised . #% I am also pleased to see that she looks so well . #% Will he ask the EFSA or a similar body to investigate how these methods have continued in the way they have ? #% Mr President , they do not give up , do they ? #% It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure that traffickers do not profit . #% We should support the moves by Premier Helen Clark from New Zealand for a concerted action at bilateral , regional and global levels , which should include , as Mr Van Hecke said , ` smart ' sanctions targeted at those involved in the coups , denying them the freedom to travel , freezing foreign assets and threatening them when they are apprehended with the consequences of the UN Hostage Convention . #% Do we follow in the wake of UN resolutions ? #% Let us be frank . #% 
I regret this , and I hope that they will shift their position . #% We have been told that the law is inadequate in this new era of greater threat . #% Many of us are concerned that the Treaty emphasizes monetary matters at the expense of economic management . #% On behalf of my group , I express to the people of Galicia our sadness at their tragedy and our solidarity and support in their battle against this modern-day black death that is threatening their livelihoods and damaging their shores . #% It is of crucial importance . #% A high watermark of philatelic interference , perforated only by ignorance of British tradition and a wish to kill letter writing stone dead . #% We believe that Parliament must take the initiative to begin preparations for the mid-term review of the next multiannual financial framework planned for 2008 . #% It is no coincidence that this was a hearing where there were no delegations from other committees and we had more time to pursue questioning . #% It is most certainly an issue for this Parliament to consider . #% Fifthly , is it true , and I believe it was , that a women 's delegation seeking to present a petition to the French Ambassador was shot at and dispersed by military personnel ? #% Do not allow the xenophobes and the anti-Europeans to slow us down . #% I understand that it has not been brought forward and therefore I would have liked to put it forward in my own name at that time . #% So far the majorities in the Grand National Assembly for reform are great , but could I urge our colleagues inside the Turkish parliament to respond to this report in a truly parliamentary fashion ? #% It means that in Fleetwood , 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April . #% I have to ask : why is this proposal necessary ? #% We need to send a strong signal to the traffickers that no matter where they operate in Europe , the penalties they face will be harsh . #% We all vote for its swift completion - quite rightly too . #% Madam President , in supporting the d'Ancona report , I want to draw attention to the continuing scandal where properly recognized refugees under international law are forcibly kept apart from each other in the different Member States . #% We therefore urge colleagues to support the four years proposed in this report because we believe we need to accelerate change through negotiation . #% Commissioner Kinnock is leading the way , at the forefront of these reforms in the Commission . #% It would be a pity if the European Parliament got itself too deeply involved in questions of linguistic arrangements that are more properly decided at national level . #% This motion calls for an end to all trade obstructions . #% The Commissioner and his services have consistently given far too negative an interpretation of ECJ jurisprudence on this point and that is why we have such clear difficulties emerging in our debate here over applying environmental and social considerations . #% One of the points I particularly want to raise with him is the question of children from partnerships . #% Since Saturday night , rail freight has been prevented completely from going through the tunnel . #% As a British Member , I am delighted at the desire voiced by the new British Foreign Secretary to give greater importance to human rights in foreign affairs and I hope we shall now end all deliveries from Europe of arms and the means of repression . #% I shall be introducing my own report and that of our distinguished colleague Mrs Patrie , who is unable to attend today . #% Mr President , I am very happy to be able to introduce my report at this evening 's plenary session . #% Regrettably , however , in its quest for international support and , in particular , energy security , China has recently courted terrorist-sponsoring Iran , and along with Russia refused to impose UN sanctions for Iran 's continuing uranium enrichment programme . #% I am the last speaker of the Socialists and my job , therefore , is not to speak about individual countries , but to sum up the general debates . #% However , for ourselves today , we face the question of how to ensure that the European Union will be a player on the world stage , how to handle the questions of AIDS in Africa , how to contribute towards peacekeeping , and how to ensure that the Union has a presence in the world . #% Some are former British colonies and others , just over a decade ago , were under the Soviet regime . #% In my Group we believe that as far as the reform of the Commission is concerned , we really need to make sure that there are signs that something has changed since 1999 . #% As has been stressed , a crucial factor underlining all these elements is the need to make rapid and positive progress on the Commission 's proposal for a simplification and modernisation of the whole of Regulation 1408/71 . #% In the UK we have a postcode lottery for this drug , with availability depending on where someone lives . #% I would like to apologise for Mr Cappato 's absence . #% Mr Evans raised the issue of expulsions . #% The Euro-Flower is just one element of the broader environmental strategy that is needed to save our planet . #% Mr President , we are all in favour of a reduction in the use of pesticides , but to suddenly decide upon a 50 % reduction is neither realistic nor practical . #% The outcome from virtually all sides has been satisfactory . #% May I say to the Commissioner that it does not seem to me to be right - other Members of this House may take a different view - to set up a European regulatory authority just because national regulation is not working . #% If so , can it publish them according to the regulations ? #% Clearly the countryside is not a museum : there are living communities there which provide a great deal of wealth and services for every one of our European citizens . #% Confidence in that system needs to be restored quickly and decisively as a major contribution to the achievement of something like normality . #% We are just at the beginning of something absolutely crucial for the future of the European economy . #% The memorandum goes on to insist on cuts in social welfare , the roll-back of key public services , and reductions in public sector employment and public sector pensions . #% I am delighted to say that announcements have been made in Britain this week by the new Labour government that in future the rather cosy but unsatisfactory arrangements whereby transporters engage their own vets to do checks will be replaced by vets appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture in Britain . #% The bus sector is important because this type-approval directive brings into play the bus directive that many of us worked on . #% When we were in Mali for the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly , I went to visit the local diabetes support clinics . #% Fortunately , a majority in this House and of the governments of the Member States want to listen to all , to bridge the divergence of views and find a solution capable of being ratified by all 27 Member States . #% There is a great need to assist some of the older farmers to retire in dignity . #% We have not discharged our responsibility of trust to the citizens of our Member States in ensuring that the money has been properly spent . #% It is referred to here but actually the Commission makes it absolutely clear that policy on ownership is not an issue . #% I can see the benefits in common security standards across Europe . #% I believe that the right to move freely only ends when the body is interred . #% A word on vaccination . #% in writing . - The EPLP can support this report in terms of the wider perspective of Member State economic actions during the current economic crisis . #% I also want to see greater and more effective intergovernmental cooperation in tackling environmental challenges and fighting the scourge of terrorism . #% I hope that colleagues across the House will recognise those particular qualifications . #% For many years Syria sponsored terrorism in both Israel and Turkey and was the main state to reject any compromise solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute based on land for peace . #% As part of this on-going determination by the Commission to simplify legislation , I would like to see much greater cooperation between Member States and the Commission about the whole life of legislation and , particularly , involvement with the people who have prime responsibility for enforcing the legislation , who are often local and regional actors . #% Finally it has to be admitted that its real use is for EU military purposes . #% But where is the added value ? #% The proposals as they are in Parliament 's text would only confuse and complicate an already over-bureaucratic system , and force agriculture into even further decline . #% It was just a vehicle for further political integration and that is something that our citizens simply do not want . #% Well it did , because all ruminant material which could convey BSE to cattle was excluded six years ago . #% 
However , I wonder whether he could assure me that the other databases I mentioned -- on works of art , wanted criminals and fingerprints -- are also satisfactorily covered by the Council position ? #% She then went out to try to get something to eat at night , with her colleagues - remember she was using a wheelchair . #% That is what we are in real danger of doing here . #% We should be grateful to our American allies for the enormous contribution they have made to peace-keeping operations in Europe . #% It seems to me , therefore , that the onus is on those who wish to see maximum harmonisation to put this case not merely in terms of what is good for the market and the single market but in terms of how the levels of information and protection can be raised in the subsequent stages of discussion of this proposed directive before it comes back for second reading . #% This resolution follows an oral question from the Agriculture committee , ands aims to give a de facto EP position on sugar ahead of the Commission 's legislative proposals . #% To this end we continue to urge the Tunisians to establish and hold a first session of a human rights subcommittee as soon as possible . #% The United Kingdom Conservatives and Socialists are opposed to those two conference rooms , as they would spoil the very pleasant entrance to the European Parliament by the flags . #% I would like to know what steps the Commission is taking to recruit the right sort of people to replace those officials who will be retiring early . #% We should call upon everyone to put every possible pressure upon the regime of Iraq to let in the weapons inspectors and give them untrammelled access throughout the country . #% It is economically naive and will do huge macroeconomic damage . #% With respect to the specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy wanted to build in greater flexibility , particularly with regard to slaughterhouses . #% I thank him for the effort that he has put into this report which has ensured that all parties concerned with the future of the maritime sector have fully participated in the development of our response . #% We owe it to them to make certain that is not the case , and shallow populist rhetoric is not the way to do it . #% We want to see that that happens in the future . #% The Commission can produce these in order to urge the laggards to take a good example from those Member States who are perhaps more advanced . #% The Kurds deserve a peaceful settlement involving a degree of political devolution and respect for their cultural and linguistic rights . #% We then came to 1993 and its referendum for independence . #% To accept what is offered here is to take a window of opportunity that is not guaranteed to remain open indefinitely . #% For the UK to maintain the right not to participate in funds managed at EU level because later benefits may flow is , in this case , uncertain and perhaps even plain wrong . #% Mr Watson referred to the UK and France being in Jurassic Park . #% I ask people in the Chamber to remove their headphones for three seconds . #% Vice-Chairman of the S&D Group . - I will indeed work on those Member States . #% That has resulted in an imbalance of compensation which is why the system now makes heavy demands , or heavier than justifiable demands , on the budget and why we will bring it to an end . #% It is something that the Parliament 's intergroup for animal welfare , which I have the honour to chair at the moment , has demanded for a very long time . #% Such policies will never happen in the socialistic EU , which is another reason why Britain should leave the European Union and take the actions required to ensure economic regeneration and prosperity while it still can . #% I also want to insist that Parliament ' s views and wishes on postal services , often stated in this chamber , are taken fully into account in any new proposals . #% The sale of diamonds from the Marange mine will help Mugabe to further consolidate his tyrannical hold on Zimbabwe and , indeed , enrich his Zanu-PF thugs . #% BSE is not an infectious disease that is transmitted horizontally . #% Specifically , it is time for the seven European Union countries which have not yet done so , including the Belgian Presidency , to ratify and implement the UN Convention for the suppression of terrorist financing , so that the black money networks which sustain terrorist organisations can be closed down . #% It is quite unacceptable . #% We will all benefit from this decision but we must look to the future . #% But what we are asking for is reasonable transparency . #% It is a ridiculous situation and a waste of money , and should be brought to an end . #% As rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy , I was very conscious that many of the member countries -- e.g. Algeria and Azerbaijan -- were producers of oil and gas , and others were central to the pipeline transit systems of fuel to western Europe , such as Ukraine . #% Firstly , the reduction of the prevalence of HIV-AIDS - a disease that has reduced life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa from 62 to 47 years - is an absolutely essential target . #% We are looking to renew this line once again . #% Mr President , I would like first of all to say to Mr Färm by that if he examines the Staff Regulations to which Mr Asp is subject , then he will see the basis on which he was written to by his former employing authority and he will see that what was said in that letter was entirely in keeping with the regulations and the requirements of communication - no more , no less . #% Can I ask President Barroso to perhaps tell us what useful lessons have been learned by the Commission in relation to the SWIFT agreement which may be successfully and usefully employed when we deal with the very important PNR agreements that await our attention , now with the United States in the first place , but also with Canada and Australia ? #% If the Canadian Government considers that it is environmentally acceptable and economically advantageous to develop their tar sands , that is entirely a matter for them . #% Commissioner Nazareth was very careful with her words in referring to the technology platform . #% I am not suggesting that direct intervention in the country which defied the Red Army is either appropriate or feasible . #% Commissioner , I also want to emphasise the importance that we attach to this regulation , providing , as it will , the ground plan , or roadmap , which will provide clarity and certainty for the basis of civil law claims across Europe . #% I hope that you , Mr President , can pass on a request to DG I that maybe one of these days they could organise a daytime debate for an important social dossier such as this one . #% The other important point is paragraph 11 of our resolution which calls upon the Irish presidency to report very quickly back to this House on what action is going to be taken by the Member States on the broad economic guidelines . #% It is not enough for people to say this lies within the competence of Member States when those same Member State governments are using market rules , the Services Directive and other means to achieve liberalisation by the back door . #% Incorporating this into existing instruments will be very difficult but somehow it must be achieved , perhaps in the ways that have already been mentioned this afternoon . #% Growth is worse . #% In fact , we are patting ourselves on the back because the bond auctions in Portugal went well last week , whereas the reality is that the European Central Bank was actually using taxpayers ' money to buy their own debt . #% in writing . - The European Parliamentary Labour Party is in favour of education in schools about the history of the European Union . #% For instance , in one of my own amendments to the report accepted by the committee I recognize there may be a danger to tourists from economic and monetary union . #% I ask her with my amendment to do one thing more . #% It applies to the limited circumstances of equal opportunities law which is civil or administrative law . #% Those who introduced the complaint do not manufacture generally in Europe , but source form other third countries rather than China . #% The separation of train operators and separation of the rail network is leading to major problems , courtesy of the EU . #% We have made a lot of pronouncements this afternoon , but there has been no clear assessment of the importance of bushmeat in people 's livelihoods . #% The sooner we can make sure that the image of the European Union is reflected by one European House , the better it will be . #% I am not entirely sure how much comfort Bulgaria will derive from this , given the earlier decision to force early closure of Kozloduy -- a decision which no longer has any technical justification in my view , but maybe this Treaty could help offset that negative message . #% At the moment it is quite complex , particularly the market intervention measures which are regarded as transitory measures by the Commission , a view that I share . #% The Executive advises us to oppose most of the Socialist amendments . #% In this particular issue there are problems of slender resources - we understand that - whether of the police or of security personnel at the areas where they are involved . #% I , like the ECR Group , reject this draconian bill , which would be an atrocious violation of individual rights , and call on President Museveni to veto it . #% We are told that the law of the sea is clear : people in distress should be rescued regardless of their status . #% You do not wait for an aeroplane to crash before you test it for safety , and neither should we for chemicals in household products . #% We got the decision on 9 December by the French Government that it would continue with the ban ; and that did come to most of us as a complete surprise . #% Firstly , this resolution is an abuse of our Rules of Procedure . #% 
At this point , 119 parents complained that they felt this policy amounted to either religious or sexual discrimination . #% Civil liberties , let us remind ourselves , need protecting from the international terrorists who operate cross-border terrorism , drug-trafficking , transnational crime , the trafficking of women and children . #% In fact , it is possible to provide white veal meat without these very cruel methods which have been the practice within the European Union , or certainly within some countries within the Union . #% Please have more respect for this House . #% Madam President , we must correct that statement if it is going to be in the record . #% Setting a reduction target at 50 % is too simplistic , as we should be targeting the most toxic products , not those with a higher dose rate , as the Commissioner rightly said at the beginning . #% Its purpose is to ensure fair access to networks for all market players and a genuinely competitive market for traded gas in the EU . #% I emphatically support the three amendments Mr Hughes has talked about . #% We thank the Commission for tackling those complex issues we did not at first expect . #% Mr President , this is an important debate to hold at this juncture , after the first few months of the US administration , with the visit of President George Bush to Göteburg in June and the Commission 's initial thoughts on the common foreign and security policy . #% It would be a benefit to the Union as a whole if the Commission and Parliament could increasingly stand together in international trade negotiations . #% If it does that , then it will have our support . #% Mr President , I very much welcome the visit of the Prime Minister of Lebanon this afternoon , but I very much regret that the Question Time session with the Council has had to be abandoned to make room for this , with no attempt by the Conference of Presidents to reschedule it to another time . #% I was not present , but I believe a number of allegations were made and cases cited by other groups earlier in the debate . #% Mr President , I would also like to concentrate on this issue of category of animal labelling . #% The framework agreement certainly changes the context of CommissionParliament relations from that of the previous debate on the fatuous motion of censure . #% The Chinese seem unable to grasp the essential point , pointed out by Mr Watts and others , that it is not simply a money-making city ; its economic welfare depends on the wellbeing of its citizens , and that point has yet to be grasped . #% Finally , we must not forget that in the global marketplace currently being created by the World Trade Organization , uncompetitiveness is a certain precursor of economic failure . #% In all labelling regimes there is a cut-off point born of the practical and scientific reality that it 's the best we can do with the science we 've got . #% It is alleged that they were tortured by whippings , electrocutions and threats from dogs into signing confessions of being homosexual . #% It seems to me that this was the point when the Commission lost all leverage . #% I can not accept the call for the ` introduction of modifications ' . #% They thought that under the Acquired Rights Directive they had some hope of protection of their rights . #% Madam President , in support of this resolution , it is right that this European Parliament maintains its criticism of violence and human rights abuses on all sides in the Colombian conflict . #% Now it is less than eight cents . #% Article 27 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights says that workers should be guaranteed information and consultation ` in good time ' , which is a rather more strict interpretation than ` as soon as possible ' . #% Therefore I believe that , where possible , not only should our own domestic public opinion be engaged at all stages but also the public opinion of the applicant countries in Central and Eastern Europe . #% Does this change affect the whole of the day 's agenda , or just part of it , and who decided on the change ? #% I request your indulgence to obtain this response before I raise the question with you again if necessary . #% On page 16 you mention the key challenges you are committed to pursuing : encouraging greater adaptability and flexibility on the part of workers and companies and removing disincentives to employment . #% I suggest that both sides are missing the point . #% We must ensure that this factor is not overlooked in the Commission 's new framework document for relations with our new European neighbours of Ukraine , Belarus and Moldova , which have a legitimate right to join the Union in future if they so wish . #% I do not think letters are sufficient . #% It is not necessary to do this ; there is no reason to split debates . #% I am also glad that Mr Andersson referred to those on short-term contracts because again we have evidence that those too , are bullied . #% This is not an international boycott : it is simply that the regime there is not capable of issuing export certificates . #% We have got to save our resources . #% However , the Taliban should be left in no doubt that , should they want our help , they will have to listen to the widespread concerns of people around the world , who are shocked and horrified at the brutal character of their medieval regime . #% So here it is , another second-class act , the Postal Directive . #% Indeed , there is no appetite amongst my constituents for a convention which would no doubt discuss further political integration . #% The answer to that problem , of course , lies not really within the European Commission and still less in the European Parliament , it rests with the authorities in the Member States . #% We need to vote on that to make sure that we have the figures before we accept that the vote we have just had is complete . #% While I am prepared to congratulate the Director-General and staff of DG XXI , I do not think we can have it as a matter of record that somehow everything was going along quite smoothly and we decided to change our approach . #% This is far from encouraging and I am curious as to what precedence this sets in the actual signing of the agreements . #% We are calling for smart sanctions that would directly hit Mugabe , his family and his cronies . #% Mr President , we all agree in this House that television is a critical industry not just in itself , but in its influence upon European society , culture and the economy . #% If they do give you what you want , it will need to be reratified in 25 Member States , which will mean that the British will have a referendum , and I am sure , as democrats , you would all like to see a British referendum on this Treaty . #% I might add to Mr Whitehead that I speak here now not just as a Member of this august Parliament but as a farmer . #% Since the European Commission is now the real government of Britain , perhaps it could do us a favour and force Britain to adopt a form of proportional representation for parliamentary elections . #% Therefore , I have three remarks to make . #% The men were tried by a state security court rather than a regular court and forced medical examinations were carried out , clearly against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . #% We are going to cause the Council and Commission problems unless Parliament gets what it has asked for , namely the right to grant discharge and the right of the Commission to do the full financial control job on these agencies . #% You got a flavour of some of the debates to come . #% That also will enhance public confidence . #% Minor updates to the ISD are , of course , welcome but above all we need a change of culture . #% Commissioner Fischler says that we should not implement the hormone panel findings but provide compensation . #% The way they have to do this is by setting interest rates that are going to maintain stability and also , as the President-in-Office said , setting interest rates that will guarantee growth and full employment in the European Union . #% So we must consider the whole process when we draft the original legislation . #% I urge Parliament to adopt the position which has been unanimously approved by the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment . #% Meanwhile our nations and societies are being dangerously fractured as a consequence of catastrophic asylum and immigration policies . #% MEPs , as we will all know , are on the receiving end of public criticism of poor implementation . #% Our job - and it clearly is our job - is to create the clear legal framework that will enable the industry to help regulate itself . #% In the area of health , we have had some very small and moderate improvements . #% Our expectations change , but it is vital that we keep up with these changes in our thinking and our policy making . #% This is not just about access to appropriate health care , it is the fact that getting access to that health care could make a huge difference to people 's working , social and personal lives . #% At the same time , what happens ? #% 
Firstly , I draw attention to the special needs of the trading bodies that apply particularly in the United Kingdom , such as the Meteorological Office , the Ordnance Survey and the British Geological Survey , which , unless they had been protected with the ability to get a reasonable return on investment , would have had their own work and their own positions seriously jeopardised . #% It is very difficult to impose ideas on working time across so many different industries . #% If we do not vote the EUR 500 million , and EUR 200 million is the final figure that the Commission settles upon , Commissioner Patten has also said that should that funding be spent rapidly and efficiently , then the Commission would come back with a supplementary and amending budget . #% On cotton , we agreed to eliminate all forms of export subsidies in 2006 . #% Madam President , in the absence of our chairman , as vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions I would point out that our committee requested the report from STOA on the possible toxic effects of Sellafield in the Irish Sea and Cap de la Hague in the English Channel . #% By over-regulating advertising we actually jeopardize the quality of European programmes . #% Such is the case with BBC journalist Alan Johnston , abducted in Gaza 46 days ago . #% We have built in an addition here that will ask for a review after five years involving the two sides of industry at European level to see how the regime is functioning in this sector with particular reference to the health and safety of the workers involved . #% For that reason I voted against the Nicholson report . #% I would also like to thank all the shadows from the other political groups . #% We want our EU neighbours to prosper too , but when they fail to do so because of blind adherence to a flawed model we would prefer not to be dragged down with them . #% The clear message coming out of 2005 and the Millennium Development Goals is that of health systems . #% Overall , the committee supported the view taken by the EU 's regulators - FESCO and now CESR - and that it makes sense for such annual updating to be optional if the issuer of bonds or shares wants to issue again . #% I appreciate that the Commission in particular , but also the other institutions , have adopted and are applying their own voluntary codes . #% This is an advance to balance free movement and competition , and ensure health and safety and consumer protection at one and the same time . #% High taxation raises revenue , but fails to cut consumption . #% So where does the Ryder Cup fit in to this particular scenario ? #% This fund is an unwelcome substitute for help by Member States . #% My approach to the priorities set out in the action plan has always been to keep it simple and focused . #% in writing . - I voted against this report because it makes it harder for nation states to return illegal immigrants . #% Give us all the information in a balanced manner , then , in full transparency , we can make a political decision for which we are accountable . #% Ironically , all three countries are cited in the resolution . #% This Parliament and others on the outside should step back , because we have a breathing space now where we can take a reasoned view of what actions we should realistically take against football hooligans , and compare that with the rights of people to freely move about our continent . #% They are normally from those families who spend their savings on a family holiday , only to see their hard-earned money go down the drain through little fault of their own . #% We applaud them for what they did . #% The only hope remains the roadmap , endorsed by the Quartet , by this European Union . #% I feel sure that the new government of Bulgaria will respond positively to the points that I have made . #% What a farce this is . #% In Plenary today I supported an amendment to send the whole report back to committee for re-working . #% Mr President , over the last few weeks we have seen the sorry spectacle of the EU dithering , this time while Lebanon burned . #% I do not believe that people are asking that . #% May I welcome the Commissioner to Parliament today on behalf of all of us . #% I will re-read the point that I wanted to make . #% Mrs Saïfi , who did an excellent job as rapporteur , discusses constructively the different levels and aspects of human rights , and environmental and social standards at differing levels . #% It is hardly surprising that the British media project the sort of image that they describe . #% The results of the general election in Northern Ireland last week show that there has been a move in support of those who are opposed to the Good Friday agreement . #% That is why I strongly support the European voluntary service . #% That is one reason why the European Union is engaged in the KEDO process . #% Madam President , in response to what Mr Poettering has said , I would just like to underline that I did not raise any question relating to your past actions . #% But we need the detail , we need the detail that is required in our Rules of Procedure and in the Framework Agreement . #% The world 's superpower is not prepared to address these imperatives , and I hope that we will make a clear case that we will not meet the millennium development goals unless we take strong action . #% We have to remind ourselves of what we are trying to address tonight , which is the reality of 110 000 jobs . #% Madam President , first I should like to compliment the rapporteur , Mr Gutiérrez Díaz , on his report and in particular for the sensitive appreciation of the situation in Northern Ireland that his explanatory text displays . #% However , this should not prevent us from defining it in the digital age , because these principles are very important to us all , and , as infrastructure has developed , so content is going to develop as well . #% We were promised that a new computer system would close all the loopholes . #% Yet because we share the same aim , and because there is goodwill on both sides , I am confident that we will have an effective and efficient directive that will eventually be adopted . #% Accept the challenge . #% Potato starch consisted of 48 % of the total starch exports in 1996-1997 . #% The first issue is that we want equal and effective enforcement of environmental legislation across the European Union and we must all agree to that principle . #% They have been poorly led for years . #% We are looking at the harmonisation of criminal provisions . #% Does the Commissioner have in mind a timetable whereby accession of these two very important economies might be envisaged , and what might be some of the steps necessary before membership were to be achieved ? #% So if anybody comes to me for European support , I tell them they are much more likely to get realistic support from their village council than they are from the EU . #% Since we are upgrading , we should also have more comfortable seats so that every passenger feels at home and comfortable in this bus . #% That can not be right , it can not be good . #% Some EU Member States put financial gain above human rights and I do not believe that that is acceptable . #% There will be a referendum in Wales tomorrow when the people will have a chance to decide to set up their own Assembly . #% That causes concern . #% Even now buy-outs - and management buy-outs in particular - are the single largest category of acting in venture capital . #% I have visited large combustion plants in two or three different states in the Union , particularly in my own , the UK . #% That is the great thing : not only is it good for farmers , but it is good for the environment . #% It is essential that this Parliament should show by example and precept that it follows the same standards that it imposes upon everybody else . #% The Kurds have been betrayed so often , but this time we must guarantee their freedom and identity . #% We do not know to what , but we can suspect . #% Mr President , I am very grateful to the honourable Members for their questions about my correspondence with my friend and former colleague , Mrs Anita Gradin , and her former chef de cabinet , Mr Christer Asp . #% I draw her attention to page 27 of this report in 1993 where it says , regarding the provision of information to the public from an environmental impact assessment , that in France the stage at which this occurs is sometimes after the execution of the project . #% 
Saddam Hussein has attempted illegally to acquire weapons of mass destruction for years . #% This morning I looked at the website that the President of the Council mentioned . #% Since the EU enlarged , our proportion of dependence on imports of coal has gone down from 50 % to 35 % , because one particular Member State is a significant producer of coal . #% In his supplementary question Mr Moraes referred to the interests of working people . #% We needed a promise that our concerns , ignored in successive treaty revisions , would be taken on board . #% That might save a lot of money . #% The situation can not continue for two reasons . #% Fifthly - and this is absolutely critical to the success of this new regime - we want public access to the information . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , may I also express my congratulations to Mrs Laperrouze . #% Nevertheless , I welcome President Musharraf 's change of heart in backing the United States in their war on terrorism which toppled the Taliban regime and destroyed the al-Qa ` ida network in Afghanistan , even though this regime was largely a creation of Pakistan 's interservice intelligence agency ; in particular , his speech of 13 January promising reforms of the madrassas , or religious schools , which fomented so much hatred of the west and bred an atmosphere conducive to the massacre of Christians peacefully at worship last year . #% The Middle East is a source of vital oil supplies to the West and the location of one of the longest and bloodiest disputes between the Arab world and Israel . #% It has been a long time coming . #% That is another area that we need to think about for the future . #% Fudged and dodged and kicked into the long grass . #% The proposals we are debating this afternoon are a miserable , insufficient response to today 's world . #% I wanted to pick out one aspect where I disagreed with him : he said that one of the choices we are faced with at the moment is between a free market and a stronger political union . #% It is not the remark of some left-wing agitator , but a sober assessment by the upper chamber of the British Parliament -- the respectable House of Lords . #% Let us not forget that at the end of the day it needs the assent of the people of the European Union and the applicant states . #% The 23 million SMEs in the EU provide over 100 million jobs and make a huge contribution to economic growth , social cohesion and job creation . #% Finally , just to sum up the four points , we need the treaty ratified as quickly as possible ; we need to deal with the tens of millions of mines and the unexploded ordnance littering the world ; and we need to deal with the problems facing the victims . #% Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform . #% Remember the examples I have given you . #% The committee is very keen on seeing maximum transparency in the disclosure of data concerning the value of the ECSC 's assets . #% The Commission has not been very successful in bringing about the implementation of all the directives which have already been placed on the statute book . #% The US has a huge capital market and equity market to help in venture capital . #% This is not simply an issue for governments but also for the Kashmiri people . #% In particular , we should look at how we assess value for money from our projects . #% I want to focus my contribution this afternoon on that report . #% Mass surveillance threatens that confidence . #% At all times the Commission has made it clear to all concerned that it expects the French government to honour any legal obligation it may have to compensate those road hauliers who are directly and adversely affected by the dispute last year regardless of their nationality . #% Bad farming practice was compounded by stupidity when pigs which no longer showed physical symptoms but could still transmit the disease were sent to an abattoir . #% It is high time the European Parliament gave two Cadbury 's Fingers to the chocolate snobs . #% I believe strongly that this report should be given Parliament ' s wholehearted support and a message should be sent to both the Commission and the Council that we are determined that these essential measures should not be diluted or weakened in any way . #% As far as possible , our electors should be allowed to get on with their lives , but we as politicians can not rest while terrorism lives . #% I welcome Mr Barroso 's commitment to the Services Directive . #% Over the past few weeks our group has actively supported all the preparatory work to enable the European Parliament to give its assent to the accession treaties with all of the ten future Member States . #% I welcomed the Commission communication , but I felt there were some areas that could be strengthened . #% Therefore , on behalf of the Socialists , I would recommend the report to the House and thank the rapporteur for all the work she has done , as well as all the other people who have been involved in this long process . #% It is a well-known saying that ` if you do n't know where you 're going , then you wo n't get there ' . #% While that might make products cheaper for southern African consumers , the effects on local industries could be extremely severe . #% I want to associate myself with the words of Mr Goerens and , indeed , take the Commission a little further . #% You are the Euronationalists , dangerous people who will stop at nothing . #% This will be taken to our group tonight and we will do our best to convince . #% It supports the view that the UK falls into line with a 1994 directive which limits the working hours of young people to eight hours a day or 40 hours a week and bans night work , although it provides for exceptions in special circumstances and for certain kinds of work . #% A multicultural secular democracy in an otherwise troubled region , it is a source of stability with a no-first-use nuclear policy . #% The small and medium-sized enterprises of the European Union are watching very closely to see how we react to this particular proposal and the common position . #% The reason for this is our enormous concern at the continued deterioration of the situation in that country with such a short time to go before the presidential elections . #% However , some of my colleagues in this House are being less than sincere by pretending to oppose the directive because of the wording of certain ethical constraints in the proposal . #% I , like the industry , the trade unions and those who work in it , look forward to the implementation of the Commission 's proposals . #% As the honourable Member points out in his question , studies into the feasibility of building a tunnel connecting Helsingør in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden have received support under the European Union 's INTERREG IIa programme . #% This exemption has important implications for my country . #% The other important aspects of country of origin principle , product placement and short extracts have been substantially modified by the rapporteur since the Commission published its original text . #% I welcome this resolution and was proud to vote for it . #% The second reform that is essential is to remove the national veto from the clauses of reinforced cooperation ; and the third will be to grant citizens the right of direct approach to the European Court . #% Could he answer some simple questions . #% There is no point in acting on the issues of barriers of national protectionism if we look backwards . #% In a Europe which claims to be social , we also denounce the cynicism of the Commission , which has plunged these workers into great difficulties - workers , some of whom are main bread-winners with children , many of whom are women . #% I fully agree with my British Labour colleagues who seek to protect low paid women in particular and , in this respect , call on the British Government to fully respect the non-regression clause in the directive . #% The uncertainty over the aid is not helpful . #% It is important especially if we look at the climate surrounding some of these discussions and debates . #% Fourthly , on Austria , the assertion is made that we should not mention Austria because of the time-frame of the report . #% I alerted the services to this point in advance this morning , but it was not taken even though it is relevant under Rule 19 ( 4 ) . #% Hopefully even those accused of participation in the 1994 civil war will be amnestied since this would be a vital step to national reconciliation . #% Without it charities will lose millions of euros each year . #% Council presidencies often present a programme to Parliament as if they were assuming executive office . #% I should like to know whether there is anything further you can do on their behalf and whether you have had that reply . #% 
There is a degree of ignorance or naivety that appals me . #% This committee may not rank as the greatest committee in Parliament but , in terms of protecting the citizens , it is the best . #% This lady herself had to have a mastectomy for preventative cancer reasons and she has had a very successful implant . #% -- Mr President , I am sorry to raise this again but , given that this issue was raised , I thought , as indicated in the voting list , that the matter had been referred to the authorities for a ruling . #% This is the last chance for Mostar . #% It is vital for the President to take immediate action to resolve issues which could trigger off clashes , perhaps directed against the Chinese , who have already been victims . #% There are , however , one or two areas where I have difficulty with his conclusions . #% That figure is a disgrace and stands to the condemnation of the EU and its Member States . #% Mr President , the social situation is dependent on employment . #% Not only aid but trade was the answer , as a short-term measure to assist . #% Furthermore in spite of all the rhetoric about trade policy supporting sustainable development , when you look at who attends the 133 meetings , it is usually simply the representatives from the trade and finance ministries alone . #% Nobody wants an all encompassing IGC dealing with every subject facing the Union in the Maastricht style , but there is a strong case to add to the agenda half a dozen key subjects which must be resolved if our Union is to work efficiently , transparently and democratically and is to be capable of facing up to having nearly 30 Member States . #% Let us not lose sight of that . #% That is of fundamental importance . #% This , of course , is not the first money laundering definition . #% Whatever the Council votes on 20 July we will still be making that point in the autumn when it comes to our first reading . #% There are between seven and eight million people imprisoned across China , there are at least 5 000 executions a year . #% Without true peace , the humanitarian effort will collapse and hundreds of thousands of people who fled their homes to save their lives will now once again face death . #% She should be presenting the committee 's report to Parliament and not tabling amendments in the name of her group . #% So much for the repeated statement that membership of the EU does not mean a loss of national identity ! #% Mrs Paulsen 's proposals have gone a long way towards improving what the Commission has tried to do in relation to the disposal of TSEs . #% I myself in this House appealed to President Fontaine last year to write to the US federal authorities to protest against the death penalty for the right-wing terrorist Timothy McVeigh . #% I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , Franz Fischler . #% I am sorry that Edward McMillan-Scott is not in the Hemicycle this morning because he has been dealing with this matter for over 15 years . #% Why is the Commission rushing forward now ? #% We can not support that . #% I wonder if , on my last day in Parliament , you could just solve a little mystery for me . #% Duty-free is a tax break , and a costly tax break , largely for the benefit of the tobacco and alcohol industries . #% We are going to have to await some further research before we can finally , hopefully , determine how these relate and how they are linked . #% We should congratulate ourselves on this European law , which has brought about significant change both inside and outside Europe . #% The Atlantic Dawn seems to be something of a mystery ship , operating off the coast of Ireland , Mauritania or wherever . #% It is a great opportunity . #% I would like to focus on the wider issue of democracy and accountability more generally . #% I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue . #% Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People 's Party or does the Austrian People 's Party continue to sit in that political group ? #% I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses . #% The reserve , with its osprey centre , attracts some 100 000 visitors a year and GBP 1.7 million a year and provides 87 jobs in a previously poor rural economy . #% However , it has chosen to go down an imposed route without consideration for customers or indeed for other EU countries . #% No one seriously believes that the Constitution can credibly be presented again to the peoples of France and the Netherlands , who have already spoken . #% He sought to drag the Queen into a political controversy and to use her name to score cheap political points . #% Mr President , I wish to add my congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Tsatsos , particularly on the way he has been able to incorporate the suggestions of his fellow MEPs from all parties . #% At least these would be proactive and could hopefully deal with some of the problems before they arise , which would make a pleasant change . #% We must remember that the primary responsibility for that at present rests with the Member States . #% The Commissioner did not actually respond to my question as to what exactly the response has been from Member State governments . #% As we have all said , we must be clear that nine years has to be seen as an absolute limit , that anything more is an aberration . #% That does not mean to say that I do not applaud the rapporteur for his efforts on the bulk of the proposal . #% We have reached a stage where something has to be done . #% Like the Brussels Convention , it assures that a court order obtained in one Member State should be recognized in another Member State without any special procedure . #% We are better placed than most to turn this into an epidemic which is curable , and not a pandemic which threatens us all . #% What we have to evaluate is whether that would help achieve the greater objective of bringing about the advances we all want to see . #% I have tabled an amendment , with the help of a dozen or so colleagues from different countries , to insert into Amendment 1 on recital F the phrase ` modernisation and reform ' . #% We are aware that in the last Parliament a lot of work was done on this by Vice-President Cot . #% Our group has not signed the compromise resolution with the larger groups for a number of reasons , but the most important one is this : We believe that fundamental reform of the World Trade Organisation 's processes and rules must be a precondition for any new round of trade talks . #% We have to be sure that these measures are put in place . #% I believe that all nations must subscribe to policies of sustainable economic development and invest in renewable energy sources . #% Questions of history are important but questions of history are exactly that , historical questions . #% The question now is whether we strengthen it at this stage or send it back to the drawing board . #% Proceedings were then brought against her on the basis of exactly the same facts by the criminal courts in Spain and she suffered years of worry and expense , until the case was finally thrown out just a month or so ago . #% It really should be ashamed of its position in this respect . #% It also demonstrates that some understanding for the Turkish situation , some balance rather than a constant barrage of politically motivated reproach , is more likely to lead to improvement in those areas where we have justified criticisms . #% There are few things more certain in life than taxes , death and pollution . #% I am sure colleagues will accept that fully and thus deal with any issues about the loss of the traditional British ` pinta ' . #% Madam President , all this is just a small sample of what we want to achieve at Stockholm . #% Why should Turkey open its ports to ships flying the flag of the Republic of Cyprus when the ports of Northern Cyprus are closed to international trade and direct international flights can not land at Ercan airport ? #% Amendment No 82 attempts to address the concern of cable manufacturers by making clear that financial responsibility for WEEE rests with the producer of the finished equipment and not with individual component manufacturers . #% I have stressed the notion of the programme as it exists at the moment because I agree with Mrs Villiers that the Fiscalis programme should not be extended to direct taxation . #% 
Several amendments would have considerably worsened the report , including the proposal that the EU should become a ` nuclear-weapons-free zone ' . #% Hampshire is a prosperous county - 100 % of European average so , no money for the Isle of Wight . #% The reasons for this are not just related to the countries concerned but are also a reflection of the growing scepticism about enlargement in certain political quarters . #% Mr President , in recent weeks we have witnessed dangerous rifts in the United Nations and in the international institutions of the democracies . #% The opening of Council meetings , despite the crass attempts by the new British Foreign Secretary to preserve secrecy , is a step in the right direction . #% The problem is that however difficult it may be to prove damages , you have to be able to show that a given product supplied by a given producer brought about this effect . #% People expect more of the airlines than they are apparently getting at the moment . #% I am glad that the Commissioner has stressed that his best endeavours and those of his team will go towards making early consideration of all these applications as effective as possible and that there will be seminars and other instruction particularly for those making applications for the first time and , sometimes , from a country which is itself a new Member State . #% With regard to this petition , the Commission promised to send information about further European legislation to protect the rights of consumers with regard to financial services . #% I should like to end by wishing you personal success . #% author . - Mr President , I welcome the resolution and , like others , I am really concerned about the truly tragic situation that we see in Iraq and on its borders at the moment . #% We also support the need for the military to give up some of their air space . #% That , then , I think is a first , very important change . #% Could she set out for us how we can work together both in the public sector and the private sector to boost investment levels in the European Union which we hope will then lead to some job creation ? #% That gives people the impression that the Commission is not listening . #% However , the EU is failing to outlaw hate crimes against people as people . #% On a more serious note , I hope that the Commissioner will join with me in regretting the fact that we now approach yet another Intergovernmental Conference , where there has not been systematic civil dialogue of the kind that I know he and we in this Parliament are committed to , so that ordinary citizens and the voluntary organizations in which they are represented have not been given a real say in the future development of the European Union . #% I believe I have come a long way to meet concerns , as you will see from compromise amendments that remind the Member States of their duties under Article 10 of the Treaty not to stand in the way of the achievement of the Community 's objectives , including transparency and democracy . #% The rapporteur has rightly drawn attention to some of the problems of the sector and particularly to the way in which companies in the United States of America are in many ways making gains . #% It is right that we are able to have this debate , it is right that these issues are being brought to our attention , but I do not believe that the United Kingdom should be singled out any more than other countries . #% We can do a lot more in the EU to support this important initiative . #% I do not mind that because the single market for rolling stock should be allowed to work . #% Yet European integration is exactly what the people are increasingly opposed to . #% We also need to improve administrative and professional standards in Turkey which are frequently woefully inadequate . #% Mr President , while fully supporting the accession of Cyprus , I question whether the Union is trying hard enough to bring about a settlement of the dispute . #% The rights of people must not continue to lag behind the rights of goods . #% It has already been approved in some 45 countries . #% If charges had been made , then they would have the right and the opportunity to defend themselves , but no charges have been made . #% That should be the ambition of us all . #% We face the challenge of an ageing population , with people living longer -- mainly healthy -- lives , but then becoming frail in older age and facing all the neuro-degenerative disease challenges that brings . #% Azerbaijan is clearly far from being a model democratic and stable Council of Europe state and the EU must now do everything possible to promote democracy and human rights there . #% The Development Council and the Seville Summit should therefore insist on a proper revision of the Commission 's communication in order to address existing gaps , add timetables for implementation and develop action plans for each measure . #% That is the decision that they are making and that is the decision that is faced by the United Kingdom . #% In normal , run-of-the-mill circumstances when we have the budget debate , we have already voted on first readings in committee , we come to the Chamber and most of us make a three-minute speech if we are lucky or , if not , a one and a half minute speech . #% We therefore welcome the emergence of Asian voices speaking together through ASEAN and other regional fora . #% I wondered whether he was going to give me an answer ? #% Some people in Britain were worried some years ago by the level of immigration from the Indian sub-continent . #% ` Conservation of tuna ' ! #% Could we not postpone it until the April plenary session in Strasbourg ? #% The comments I shall make will in essence be confined to the Whitehead report , although they will clearly have implications for some of the other reports too . #% I do not believe these events are unconnected with the politics of this institution . #% We know that on the eve of the WIPO informal meeting , we have one further chance to address this matter in September . #% I say to all Members of this House , the Commission and the potential candidates for the ECB : please understand that the success of that bank , operating in Frankfurt , will depend upon its public acceptability and its public accountability . #% The other issue that came up between us was the question of the payment of donors . #% Let me also say on a personal matter that in my own Member State , my partner of 18 years , can not possibly inherit my pension . #% I do not think they would use the term ` delicacy ' , as the Council did . #% We can not wait until December 2008 before we review these cases . #% At the same time we have the problem of what to do with the residue from the oil refineries , because we are taking the sulphur out of the fuel used in road vehicles , fuel which is 26 000 parts per million sulphur . #% The real place to adjudicate , therefore , is in a court of law . #% I therefore particularly welcome this proposal . #% It is not as if we were some devious clique involved in destroying businesses . #% That is the challenge , but this debate is not just about long faces , sympathy and pity ; it is about celebrating the abilities of people with disability and seeing how we can enable them to function and to contribute to their own lives , economies and communities . #% President-in-Office , you mentioned the issue of data retention . #% This situation highlights the risks in having any sort of job which has a different rate of pay if performed at European level rather than at national level . #% Parliament should also be kept fully informed of progress in the shelter construction , the decommissioning of the site and the completion of the two reactors . #% But , as is only too obvious , many developing countries have neither the technological capacity nor the finance to do this . #% Amnesties are sometimes necessary if unpalatable . #% Equally there is no need for Europe continually to seek disagreement with the United States over the death penalty which remains legal in international law . #% It is essential that we look for new ways and the best ways to meet the objective of balanced and sustainable development in a way which meets our own needs , those of the environment and which does not have a negative impact on the living standards of those in the poor parts of the world . #% If codecision is to have any meaning , that is a position we will maintain to the end . #% We have campaigned from the start to end the requirement for mandatory , annual shelf registration . #% There is terrible human suffering at the heart of the coffee business and we must put pressure on the companies to do more and care more . #% Dakar is an opportunity to deliver on internationally agreed targets . #% Mr President , I welcome the proposals to provide legal rights for passengers as well as the increase in denied boarding compensation and the right to reimbursement for delayed flights . #% But if some see that as a cloud , then the annex appended to the final text by the Commission must be seen as a very significant silver lining to that cloud . #% From what you said , I assume you are saying no sanctions , that it is a matter of wait and see and giving them time to sort themselves out before we take any action . #% 
That is regrettable because the industry needs to know its future . #% As a result of that broadcast , and as Commissioner responsible for Personnel and Administration , I was obliged to write to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp on 22 November to request confirmation and clarification of the reported remarks , in order to enable the Commission to establish whether or not the remarks in question would require any action by the Commission . #% Mr President , at the Conference of Presidents Mr Antonione correctly stated that the downward spiral of violence must be stopped . #% At some point the French -- above all , it seems -- must give something to enable those seeking a deal to be able to point to future changes and reviews of the agricultural policy , not just to help the UK out of a difficult situation but to help the world secure an agreement on the Doha Development Round . #% Given the current climate of suspicion , with another crash in New York of an airliner this evening , what additional security measures will be taken to protect us ? #% There are in any budget process successes and failures . #% Our ACP adopted resolutions in Brussels in 2001 , in Cape Town in 2002 and in the Year of People with Disabilities , in 2003 , in Europe , we got the guidance note . #% I have met people during the six years that we have worked on this subject who have suffered needle-stick injuries , and I would really emphasise that trauma . #% Most of the 640 million people who live in the Least Developed Countries , just over one-tenth of the world 's entire population , are struggling to survive on less than two dollars a day . #% We sit down , talk it through and try to find a solution acceptable to everyone . #% I speak not only for my own country of Scotland but also from knowledge of some of the more remote Greek islands and of the north of Finland and Sweden . #% I would therefore be delighted if we could continue that process at the moment , particularly emphasising the importance of Kaliningrad as a major source of difficulties and issues for the European Union to resolve . #% I refer to Article 1 of Annex I of our Rules of Procedure . #% I hope we will decide this week and that we will not have the third and fourth Funk reports next year . #% Hassan Nasrallah , its leader , has admitted as much . #% Sustainable development includes development and where is the commitment to that in the EU 's position ? #% I believe we should encourage research in these areas by underpinning an element of the research costs . #% Such flexible , targeted , measured and appropriate responses are good examples of what can be achieved . #% Mr President , I have listened very carefully to the Commission and Council and find it extraordinary that neither has mentioned the fact that two EU Member States possess nuclear arsenals , and that this undermines the moral authority of the of the EU in the debate on nuclear disarmament . #% On a technical point , I look forward to hearing the Commission 's response on the amendments which have been moved about the legal basis for this directive . #% On the regulation , I think you have heard that the consensus view in Parliament is going to be in favour of Mrs Doyle 's approach , and I am very loathe to use EU legislation to reduce environment standards in different Member States . #% The Socialist Group has consistently argued that military action was a last resort because of the very dangers of military action which we are seeing at the moment . #% We have seen the total destruction of a unique , distinctively different and ancient tribal people . #% Mr President , there is no doubt that the CFSP must be strengthened , particularly in the areas of early warning , conflict prevention and the development of the European security and defence identity . #% Is there not a danger that the finger of blame will be pointed at the Union , because these difficult issues are being forced upon Member States for decision at this stage ? #% But the legal problems that this raises touch on subsidiarity . #% We congratulate the presidency on all its efforts in the last couple of weeks . #% But it is necessary too for Parliament , as well as for the Commission , to reflect upon the outcome of the approval procedure . #% Mr President , I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very clear report , particularly the explanatory statement , which uses illustrations . #% Funding administered by our own government would ensure that the whole transport infrastructure - rail , road and air - receives the attention it deserves for the benefit of all our small businessmen in the South-West , and all of those people involved in our vital tourism industry . #% Secondly , we support Commissioner Patten 's proposal for a peace laboratory at Magdalena Medio . #% As he has already outlined the background to this particular proposal which very importantly fills a legal vacuum , I do not need to repeat it #% I wanted to contribute because , as colleagues on the other side of the House know , there are differences between groups on the important issue of corporate social responsibility . #% The committee has heard from many people who invested in Equitable Life and who have lost a great deal of money , which has caused them great hardship . #% Let them admit that the EUR 35 million budgeted for does not achieve Mr Patten 's own commitment made on 16 September in order to keep the Commission 's own seat on the Global Health Fund board . #% No one out there can affect that process ; no one in here can originate or terminate reports that come our way , so why should anybody care ? #% It is very important to get this legislation right in order to protect EU poultry and ensure that legislation is proportionate to the risk posed . #% Fifthly , provision is made for the rare occasions when a Member is obliged to assert a privilege or immunity before a court . #% Here is a country which can enter into a trade agreement with the EU without having to join the club , without having to pay the membership fee or take on thousands of directives and regulations every year . #% Secondly - and in my opinion of paramount importance - is the need to balance the problem of tyre noise and tyre safety . #% Our constituents want reform . #% It seems to me , having been to all these COPs , that we are caught now between this being a continuing and at times difficult negotiation and , at the same time , being an institution with administrative responsibilities . #% That does not , of course , justify us ignoring our own traditional positions . #% I am also concerned at reports that the military were motivated by the feeling that the Sharif government was not doing enough to protect and maintain the Federation of Pakistan . #% Mr President , it is estimated that Iran could have nuclear weapons within three to ten years , although the point of no return in stopping that development could be reached much sooner . #% Of course , there is the increasing pressure on the opposition . #% Mr Bowis was absolutely right : we must not forget that although it mainly affects women , one thousand men die of breast cancer each year . #% Therefore , I would hope we could include this on the voting list tomorrow . #% My own amendments focus on safety aspects . #% There are a very small number of SMEs throughout Europe that continue this traditional art , mainly in Belgium , the Netherlands , France , Portugal and the UK . #% We are therefore at the point - on the linear career system , on systematic appraisal and on a host of complementary activities - of making formal proposals , and of beginning detailed consultations on them . #% Children 's needs must come first . #% Another of my interests is India , which is clearly amongst several potential great powers that are in the midst of internal transition . #% Therefore , my contribution may seem somewhat esoteric in the context of what I have been hearing this afternoon . #% We wonder who will agree those structural indicators and just how strong the synthesis report to be produced by the Commission will be . #% Other issues have still to be addressed . #% This directive possibly changes part of the regulation . #% They seem to be twofold . #% Who says there could remotely be a risk ? #% We must face up to the huge number of farmers in these enlargement states and we must find some way of helping them to restructure their agriculture as and when they come into Europe . #% Three things are clear : one , women 's wages are on average lower than men 's across all occupations ; two , women are predominantly employed in areas where the work has traditionally been regarded as of less value ; three , women comprise a significantly higher proportion of part-time workers than men . #% Now he says he would take , or would have offered to take , some beef from some herds in some parts of the UK , irrespective of the date-based scheme . #% We are pleased to be sending a strong and practical message to eurosceptics everywhere that we are in Europe to make this continent a better place for us all . #% It is realistic to anticipate that by the end of October the Commission will be in a position to take a final view of the whole of the human resource policy reforms , including a career structure that is more linear and in the best professional interests of the permanent and independent European public service . #% As a UK Member of this Parliament I understand other Members ' concerns . #% This is an enabling , liberating directive . #% 
The rapporteur , in her address , and the Commission seem obsessed with liberalization . #% The provision of a review clause would be helpful and I trust the Council will introduce this . #% On this basis I abstained . #% The Council shares the concerns of Members of this House about the human rights situation in Tunisia and is well aware of the shortcomings in Tunisia 's performance , particularly with respect to acts of intimidation and harassment by the authorities against civil society and human rights activists . #% Then , of course , we would have to look at the proposal for the EUR 200 million and I would hope that , if the EUR 500 million is rejected , we do not decide that EUR 30 million is the amount to which we are totally committed . #% However , our job does not finish there . #% I wonder whether we could consider having a birthday party for the question on its 21st anniversary when it comes of age , because it appears to be proceeding exceedingly slowly . #% Come up with a good solution and you will have the backing of this House and the backing of football supporters across Europe . #% As a priority , I hope that Britain will put the roadmap for Arab-Israeli peace back on the agenda and combat nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea . #% Innocent people are targeted . #% If we add to that the Court of Auditors ' report on the operation of the political groups , we have come to the conclusion in our political group that we need to postpone discharge on its own merits . #% This resolution has left a sour taste with British sugar producers , many of whom have written to me and my British colleagues . #% One of the few silver linings of this illegitimate war is that even in the UK more people realise how crucial it is to have a single European voice . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs , Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Viola , on having produced guideline resolutions which are just that . #% That , I suppose , is a step forward - at least from where some Member States were . #% If the Council says it is inappropriate to comment in any way , it is probably difficult . #% We also want to see prevention of the use of drugs that damage health . #% We very much hoped that this would pressure national governments - especially our own - to produce a better deal . #% Now we need to make certain that we have , a fair market and a free trade for people so that families and children can work and move around with rules that are fair , rules that work and European institutions that enforce them . #% An EMU is just a sophisticated form of a fixed exchange rate . #% The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this . #% A one-word answer will suffice . #% This includes , amongst other things , insisting on the use of FAO identification standards for EU vessels and those entering EU ports , and on the development of proper catch documentation schemes . #% I think , quite frankly , that the ambitions of Parliament , as expressed by the Committee on the Environment , have exceeded the wishes of the Commission and the Council , particularly with regard to diesel engine trains . #% Our group will judge its proposals and initiatives on their merits . #% It is crucial if we are going to have a global market and a globally competitive market within the European Union that we move forward on international harmonization . #% At the heart of this debate lies the problem of the World Trade Organisation . #% Elections are not just about a snapshot on a day ; what is at stake is how we cover the whole electoral process . #% My reading of this compromise is that it is not in any way eroded and we must make sure that it is not eroded when we come to the vote . #% I wish him the very best and hope that maybe , when we both come back in July , we will continue some of that particular discussion . #% I do not expect the Chairman of the PPE Group , or the Chairman of the S&D Group - who was shaking his head as I spoke - to understand the critical importance of this , but I believe that very soon they will have to . #% However , with the assistance of the Commission and the last Belgian Presidency , Parliament has been able in the meantime to use its negotiating powers to turn a simple wish list into a requirement for our various governments to take action which will significantly improve air quality across Europe . #% To this end , I regard this report as a major part of the machinery of good practice and effective regulation in this field . #% All this was blamed on Brussels , on those wicked people in the European Commission , or in the European Parliament . #% On safety , we fully support the Commissioner in his efforts to make non-binding IMO resolutions binding and compulsory through EC legislation . #% I am concerned that in an attempt to reconcile the different requirements of Member States -- between hot countries and cold countries -- the Commission may come up with compromises that set standards well below the best that can be achieved . #% The focus on Africa is bolstered by the massive wave of popular support for Bob Geldof 's Live 8 . #% First , the Commissioner sent out warning letters earlier this year to the candidate countries . #% I conclude by again thanking the rapporteur . #% As Mr Spencer said , if we can achieve the euro , we ought to be able to achieve a genuine foreign and security policy . #% It should be specifically noted that supplementary pensions are NOT State-provided social security payments , and can not therefore come within the scope of Regulation 1408/71 . #% I hope that when we look at the salary level we will look again at the report of independent experts , which gave an excellent way forward for looking at the salary issue . #% I believe that when we look at fisheries , especially at catching plaice and sole -- and basically they are mixed fisheries because other species are being caught , cod included -- we have to be much more radical than we are at the moment . #% The animal welfare organisations which campaigned tirelessly for this outcome should not complain about the compromise that we achieved . #% I note with great pleasure that the Council conclusions refer to ` sustainable and efficient energy systems ' . #% This report has finally found a route to agree between ourselves in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . #% Madam President , I should like to express my strong support for the policy of the Commission and the Council on Cyprus . #% Furthermore , problems have arisen of people being held for long periods without trial because of bureaucratic delays caused by translation problems and because of the lack of proper legal aid . #% In other words it is an English responsibility . #% I am grateful for recent assurances from Commissioner Byrne that the new European Food Agency will consider how such information can best be provided . #% One could say that we are dealing with a Greek tragedy , but one that affects other EU citizens . #% We need improved testing , but we need direct intervention here from the Commission , and I am confident that we will get it . #% For that reason I would urge colleagues to reject it . #% That is a figure that Messrs Blair and Schröder were contemplating during the Vienna Summit . #% This will help make our fishing more sustainable . #% Can she confirm that she has taken real notice of the European regulators , who have , I think , been fairly critical of her initial approach and are being very cautionary about what she is proposing to do ? #% Anyone would think there is an election going on in the UK and the Socialists wish to exploit this Parliament for narrow , national , political point-scoring . #% The result of this economic boom has transformed China into the world 's fourth-largest exporter and , as we have seen in today 's earlier debate , has made it extremely competitive in a number of industrial sectors . #% I maintain that allegation in that both the Council and Commission have introduced a new mandatory and blanket exception on the basis of opinions or individual opinions . #% The Commission is making a brave attempt here . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Madam President , it is always good to see you in the chair when we are discussing issues about the plights of others . #% We still are , but a once-simple idea has become over-complicated and unworkable . #% As for the policy of digressivity , I normally agree with Mrs Sanders-ten Holte , but digressivity simply shows the lack of vision of the people who dreamt up that policy - a total lack of vision , in stark contrast to the vision of the founding fathers of Europe . #% I welcome the reference in the Commission 's work programme to Plan D for democracy , dialogue and debate . #% That is why many of us in the interinstitutional working group have been urging you in the European Commission to think about how you could extrapolate your excellent work in the impact assessment field and urge all institutions to sign up to similar practices . #% It seems to me that a roll-call vote engages the political responsibility of Members of this House in a way that is unusual and we should be given notice of that . #% 
Across Europe , the agricultural sector is in severe difficulties and stretching its budget further does not seem feasible at this stage . #% Of course we must encourage unremunerated donation . #% But we should all recognise that a whole range of factors are involved in maintaining overall security of supply , not just transmission and interconnection . #% We should not allow this plenary session to pass without paying some attention to the fact that the Nobel laureate and Sakharov Prize winner , Aung San Suu Kyi , is still denied her freedom . #% Consultation with all actors in the industry is vital if the regulation is to be effective . #% When we do that , it will enable the MODINIS programme , which is very carefully and tightly focused on achievable objectives , to help us reach the Lisbon goals . #% Just two days ago a federal appeals court rejected attempts to clarify the legal situation of some Guantanamo Bay detainees , including two Britons . #% On that basis , we should support the Environment Committee 's suggestions and the bulk of what the Commission is trying to do . #% There was a sketch where Eric Morecambe is playing and is making a real honky-tonk noise . #% So , the promotion of sport also bolsters and enhances other Community projects , ranging from the fight against racism and social exclusion , to the inclusion of disabled people . #% Could the Commission enlighten us as to when we might expect that common position ? #% That is why we urge the Commission to take very seriously the recommendation in paragraph 18 of the resolution that consideration be given to extending the import controls relating to health and hygiene to cover the products of IUU fishing as well . #% I believe that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria , which is really the fifth-and-a-half wave as initially they were supposed to join at the same time as the other 10 new Member States , will also prove to be a great success . #% In my opinion it will work and I say that on the basis of my own experience of the television and film industry . #% It certainly needs to be reviewed at regular intervals . #% The rhythm of the Conference of the Parties makes it difficult to take political initiatives between conferences . #% This is particularly so in my home region , the West Midlands , where this delay is causing a great deal of uncertainty to local communities and the local taxpayers , who are having to underwrite the projects to the tune of many millions of pounds , pending the resolution of the problems I have outlined . #% Furthermore you said that if you voted in favour of this report you would be helping drug dealers . #% Is it not the case that the partnership principle in Lomé actually might lie at the heart of the problem ? #% My second point is not on the plutonium programme -- North Korea has stated that it now has nuclear weapons -- but on one of the causes of the crisis , which was the claim by the United States that North Korea had a highly enriched uranium programme . #% In practice we do not believe it will help financially those who need it most . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I am very pleased indeed to have the opportunity to present my report on early years learning in the European Union , which is an extremely important aspect of education that we have not really given much attention to before now . #% Provocation leads to violence , which is met by violence , which leads to revenge and a slippery slope away from a just and peaceful modus vivendi . #% That is why we need a different legal basis and a panel of experts broadened to include independent scientific experts on public health and food safety . #% In my view the Dell ` Alba report is not formally in contradiction with the Treaty obligation to which Mr Ford has referred . #% I think it would be very helpful if the British media , in particular , could learn the difference , particularly since the words exist in English , between the description and definition of coordination and harmonisation . #% I say to those Members opposite who say they are going to vote against these measures tomorrow and who , like Mr Coelho and Mrs Klamt , have said nice things about a common European asylum policy : you can not say nice things about it on one occasion and then , every time there is a vote , vote it down . #% Let that be a lasting testament to his work . #% Mercury cell technology is being gradually replaced by the environmentally superior and energy efficient membrane cell technology and this conversion is releasing surplus mercury across the European Union . #% They must be asked to keep that in mind and act on it . #% There may have been some justification for special measures in border areas , but the way this panic has spread and infected most Member States is shameful . #% Good governance is surely an issue for all of us . #% It is not a question of counterfeiting or other spurious issues . #% I personally hope that we vote to retain Article 4 . #% There is a possibility of conflict in the world 's rule-making bodies on anti-competitive measures , which we know the US would strongly resist . #% Rather than being the force that drives the necessary reforms , it is the EU with its endless regulations and interference that is holding back the economies of Europe . #% Our research has already indicated that one woman in four experiences violence during her lifetime and 90 % of the perpetrators are men . #% We are all concerned about the apparent fait accompli in the statement by the Council . #% Export credit guarantees can help exporters to reduce risk and compete outside the EU with more confidence to find new markets . #% It is not only drivers who are killed but the families in the other vehicles they might plough into . #% Openness to criticism is not a weakness but a strength . #% The great error of Europe 's leaders is to assume that none of the great challenges facing us can be met without a Constitution . #% That is why these reports we are debating this morning are so important . #% Who will gain from potential forum-hopping other than litigation lawyers ? #% Do we want to say that upholding EU laws does not matter or do we want to say it actually matters a very great deal ? #% I commend the report and the work of the temporary committee . #% It is very important for us to recognise that this resolution is being debated here today at a very important time . #% Because of all the support for this initiative , both within the committees and from public reaction , I am very hopeful that once it has been considered by Parliament it will be taken up and put into effect and will assist in protecting that vulnerable section of society that needs protection in this fast-moving and growing area of new technology . #% The research community and the wider community expect a great deal from the Seventh Framework Programme , as it is seen as a crucial part of the Lisbon strategy for strengthening the European economy . #% Others have spoken about this . #% Notwithstanding what Mr McMillan-Scott said about the asymmetrical nature of the Customs Union benefitting us more than it has benefitted Turkey , that position is definitely beginning to change gradually . #% My action here does not imply a softening of my attitude to the EU and its impenetrable , inflexible and unaccountable structure . #% That story is repeated across the European Union . #% I very much agree with the price package that has come out of the Commission - it is very similar to a lot of the proposals I put forward two years ago when I was the rapporteur on that particular price package . #% I will be voting in favour of Mrs Aubert 's report on organic production and labelling of organic products . #% The directive permits no postponement of the deadlines , and the Commission must understand that if it comes back in a few years ' time with proposals for new legislation to extend the time limits yet again it will meet with a very hostile response . #% Recently published and well-respected scientific work from Germany , Italy and the UK , as well as the rapporteur 's own country of Denmark , shows no direct quantifiable link between whole-body vibration and back pain . #% Ethnic minorities , very often women , children - those who sometimes find the system difficult - will be the ones who are most at risk in this sort of situation . #% Words and political commitments by the Ecofin Council were not enough . #% There are a number of amendments from the PSE Group that were rejected in committee - narrowly , it is true - and which have now been tabled again . #% We need to stress that cooperation rather than harmonisation must underlie any measure in this area . #% Unfortunately , this report conflicts with a number of stated positions of my party , the British Conservatives , as it attempts to dilute UK veto powers with a double veto and suggests an EU seat on the Security Council , which would undermine British and French membership . #% in writing . - While I fully subscribe to genuine measures to overcome racism and extremism , this sort of resolution , generated by the Left , is not helpful and is merely intended to take forward their own distorted agenda . #% The question is whether they will exercise it in a balanced and useful way . #% Mr President , it is not often that a politician of my calibre gets to speak to such a packed and huge audience . #% It was not made from any personal sense of grievance whatsoever but in pursuance of my parliamentary duty . #% 
There is big money at stake here . #% The first has been mentioned several times already today , and that is contributions to European political parties . #% I am pleased to have been a member of the teams in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , which have worked very hard with the Commission to push through directives on matters such as the unbundling of the local loop and the whole of the electronics communications package . #% There are interesting imbalances within it . #% We have to keep moving forward . #% There is no more important question in the campaign for comprehensive human rights for disabled people than the pursuit of accessible public transport . #% I am sure you will agree with me , Commissioner , that we can not afford to fail . #% Yet legislation like this will cripple their very existence . #% I can safely say that the timetable now is just a mere guide , not a definitive object , when planning travel . #% I have not changed my mind , but I accept that I have lost the argument . #% Fusion power is perhaps technically renewable energy , nevertheless this is not what we are talking about here . #% Mr President , I share and express my sympathy for the United States and for the other victims of this terrible incident . #% The positive is that it will be a physical recognition of the Union moving together closely when it actually benefits individual Member States . #% Both provide very important commitments to the way forward . #% That is the way to re-engage the electorate with the European Union . #% What we can potentially do has been recently demonstrated in the not entirely different context of the Aceh conflict in Indonesia - the world 's fourth largest country and largest Muslim state . #% In my country this is known as leading them down the garden path . #% I learnt that in the old flag there were five stars , one for each of the five Somali nations : French Somalia , which is now Djibouti ; the British part of Somaliland , which is now part of Somalia ; the British part of Kenya , which was made up of Somalis ; the Italians with southern Somalia , which is now very much Somalia ; and the Ethiopians in Ogaden . #% In this case I am not satisfied , as Mr Bowis has said , that the Commission really heeded the advice of its own advisers . #% Resolutions were tabled because the committee was not satisfied with the institutional procedures and wished to obtain assurances from the Commission and the Presidency . #% The Commissioner knows from my own correspondence with him of the difficulties we have had in the East Midlands with the Denby scandal and others where meat was wrongly identified and sold when it should not have been . #% I do not believe it is our place to make such a momentous change to our one-China policy in the middle of an urgency debate . #% I would say it is our democratic duty to stand up for what we believe is the right solution for consumers and for e-commerce in the European Union regardless of whether that gives distress to Mr Byrne or not . #% It is Question Time , and a ` yes ' or a ` no ' would have been easier , but never mind . #% Commissioner Lamy has put forward ` everything but arms ' in the new proposals that are helping these underdeveloped countries . #% If you would allow me , I failed to thank my good colleague Mrs Cederschiöld with whom I worked very closely , as with others , on my report , and I thank the House for its patience . #% We have concerns regarding the powers and independence of regulators and infrastructure managers in some of these Member States . #% One of the questions we have to ask , quite frankly , is how many beans are the Member States prepared to pay for enlargement ? #% Let us also recall that the Commissioner ' s response in this Parliament last year that a communication on coherence had to wait until the overall development policy statement had been agreed . #% If we had more time we might have been willing to have a bigger fight with the Council over some of the amendments . #% A working group will then further develop the Commission proposal , taking into account the additional information on the situation in other international organisations which is currently being collected . #% I think on the question of human rights promotion , which represents universal values accepted worldwide , we now have an instrument which has the capacity and the flexibility to work effectively , primarily through civil society , and to achieve the goals of the European Union in its Treaty obligations towards human rights worldwide . #% The leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia refuse to give the people the right to choose their own government and to respect elections , as has been the case in Ethiopia . #% Let me turn briefly to sugar , with which the Commissioner has been directly involved . #% We also want to know exactly what the Commission 's response to those allegations is . #% We do not share that view and we are perfectly content that there should simply be obligations on Members and not on third parties . #% Unfortunately , as Mr Pimenta has already pointed out , this morning 's news demonstrates that other organizations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development do not seem willing to investigate in any serious form through these cost option studies other possible ways of solving East and Central Europe 's energy problems . #% A number of Member States , for example , are very concerned about children being left without appropriate adult care at times while their parents and carers are at work . #% We had one British petitioner who succeeded in getting her years of teaching experience recognised by the French authorities , presumably affecting her salary and promotion prospects . #% We want to make sure that Member States do not undermine the single currency when it is created , but be realistic about this . #% It will have a role to play in risk analysis , risk communication and risk management , where its advice is appropriate . #% I want them to work towards a date by which the long-term objective of never having ozone levels exceeding WHO guidelines will be achieved . #% Otherwise this trade might seem to be acceptable because the CITES conference is being held there . #% Some of the information on which decisions are based is highly sensitive and confidential and should remain within the domain of government . #% I regard homeopathic medicines in the same way . #% The UNDP is coordinating technical assistance and the UN election assistance secretariat is coordinating the observation team . #% I want , however , in a rare mood of openness to congratulate Doug Henderson , the President-in-Office , for what I thought was an extremely constructive speech earlier this evening . #% The Commission proposes , therefore , the creation of a locally established reconstruction agency to ensure the effective application of the Community ' s reconstruction programme in Kosovo . #% There are two demonstration farms in my Lincolnshire constituency . #% Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate those who have been responsible for getting the report to this stage . #% We have outstanding promises for legislation on homeworking , on teleworking ; we have the yawning gap of social security in atypical work that has been outstanding for almost a decade now ; we have the promise of a specific directive on muscular-skeletal injuries outstanding from the last medium-term Social Action Programme . #% This is especially so in the Structural Funds , which directly touch the lives of so many of our own citizens . #% Many of the amendments are seeking to strike the correct balance between them . #% Mr President , about a third of this poor , over-populated but democratic country of 140 million people is landless and forced to live on , and cultivate , flood-prone land . #% If it was possible to make a legal judgment on precluding competition before - and one has to assume it was , since it has been part of the standard directives for many years - it should still be possible now without adding to the legal traps of those directives . #% Secondly , would he like to comment on the fact that we need to make sure that all countries of the European Union , not just those that will be joining on 1 January 1999 , must start preparing , because all their businesses will be affected ? #% We also support the emphasis placed by this Commission on deregulation and the rigorous pursuit of impact assessments , something British Conservatives have long argued for . #% In the case referred to by the honourable Member , the advisory committee on appointments shortlisted a female candidate with good qualifications . #% What concerns me if there is a developing crisis that may have an effect on other countries , is that there should be some mechanism for crisis management between these organizations and including defence organizations like NATO and WEU . #% With China well on its way to reducing its carbon intensity by 45 % , it is in our economic interest to make sure that we take these measures , or we are going to be left behind economically . #% Until the last moment they skilfully obtain the insertion of several paragraphs coming from their own resolution and the deletion of text they dislike , but at the end they refuse to sign the joint resolution , for some spurious reason such as one word in the text being unacceptable for the Greens . #% Some supermarkets like Marks & Spencers have banned battery cage eggs completely and now only sell free-range eggs . #% Can Members please cooperate with this project , in order to justify the change and the human resources dedicated to making it work ? #% This is a fundamental right . #% in writing . - I supported this report as it sets out the need for a coherent policy on the future of industry across the EU . #% Let us look at some of the figures . #% 
There have been a lot of cultural changes in the way the process has evolved . #% Let me try and simplify it . #% The Partido Popular politicians say that the petitions in Valencia have been imagined . #% Of course , what we need is to ensure that safety is our key criterion . #% There is a tendency among some financial commentators to assume that we must have further regulation following Parmalat , and the organisations that are most squarely in the frame for further regulation and registration are rating agencies . #% What clear legal basis is there inside this European Union ? #% Mr President , in all our efforts to help construct a better Afghanistan we should not lose sight of why we are now involved there with such commitment . #% However , I and my group still feel that it would be best to have a directive that draws together the various pieces of legislation in this field into one overall legislative text . #% I fear that it may be extremely costly to implement and we need to make sure that his services are keeping an eye on it and that it is not being duplicated by the national regulation . #% I should also like to thank the rapporteur for ensuring that Marco Polo will be even more business-friendly than PACT was . #% That would be by far the most sensible solution rather than an outright ban and to force a number of small companies out of business , thereby losing the skills and traditions that have existed in Europe for several hundred years . #% Of course , in previous times , there was a very successful independence movement that campaigned on the slogan of ` no taxation without representation ' and you certainly are not a representative . #% I am glad she is not going to be leaving us . #% If you look , for example , at Canada , it almost seems frightened to have its name on products . #% The joint high-level group chaired by the former Secretary-General of the Council , Mr Niels Ertsbøl been particularly useful in facilitating a very thorough constructive and productive process of consultation with staff representatives . #% These discharges have not only killed thousands of fish but also resulted in dangerous levels of E. coli and other harmful bacteria . #% Benefits which we can work towards are specifically and generally a positive . #% I hope that at the end of tomorrow 's vote , the resolution we pass will set out very clearly that we want the Committee of Experts to bring forward those recommendations . #% That is the text we would suggest and it is actually very similar to the PSE Group text which comes next . #% In the field of chemicals policy , the field of preserving biodiversity , climate change , transport and the protection of air and water quality , there are clear and worthwhile proposals that could be built upon in the conciliation process . #% I know that you are very efficient at getting business through this House , but I urge you please to inform the Conference of Presidents of the continuing dissatisfaction of colleagues in this House about the times of votes being changed arbitrarily , at considerable inconvenience to the way this House 's business is conducted . #% So I welcome the agreement . #% Whilst the proposed phase-out for mobile air conditioning is at present unacceptable , there is no phase-out provided for at all for the use of F-gases in many other applications where alternatives are available . #% But I would like to say something about the pension question . #% To produce fat reports which will be translated into 11 languages but which nobody will read . #% Mr President , yet again this Parliament finds itself debating another maritime disaster . #% I am afraid the UK experience has in fact been largely negative on all these counts . #% I just happen to believe that this is done not by rationing , quotas or controls but by encouraging and helping the promotion and production of local programming . #% In some ways she is ideal , is she not ? #% Many of you may be unaware that part of Cyprus is already part of the European Union because Great Britain retained sovereign bases on Cyprus and Mr Tsiakourmas was seized from one of those bases shortly before Christmas . #% I am a little surprised , therefore , that the ALDE Group , having been involved in this , have asked for a split vote . #% Although I have some reservations about references to the social market in the EPP resolution , I am happy to support it . #% But this proposal is primarily about containment , not banning . #% We now have to compete with India , China and the United States , and the longer we brush the reality aside , the Lisbon Agenda remains nothing but an aspiration . #% We rightly call for improvement in that area . #% That they became victims of a clash of bureaucracies is now a matter of history and hopefully this report will compel an equitable solution . #% Secondly , if a decision is called back , it only goes to one branch of the legislative authority , namely the Council , even when it is codecision legislation adopted in the first place by Parliament and the Council jointly . #% However - with new technology , with new travelling arrangements , and indeed with people who want to abuse the system using that technology - it has become more and more difficult for the authorities to treat people in an appropriate and fair manner in handling their cases . #% Commissioner Patten replied to me , as did the UK Foreign Office Minister Bradshaw , expressing concern and willingness to monitor the situation , which this House is raising with concern again today . #% It is very easy to carry on bashing the food industry , but would you not agree that it is time for people to recognise that individuals have responsibility for their own lives and that exercise plays a huge part in what is clearly an important issue ? #% Mr President , the consequence of adopting a shoot-to-kill policy in response to the terrorist attacks in London is that the UK is now directly responsible for the killing of an innocent man based solely upon his appearance . #% The political elites of Europe are ever more distanced from their electorates . #% That is precisely the sort of action our citizens want to see . #% Do I see in the report that EU islands , especially in the outermost regions , might be used as sources of renewable energy ? #% That would certainly be cheered in the English West Midlands , where skilled workers are suffering at the hands of EU economic policy . #% Mr President , my group would also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for his work on this excellent own-initiative report : it has been a very good evening for those . #% I wonder , do these ten new members really know what they have let themselves in for ? #% Process can be important , and we must get that right . #% I mean the underlying crisis which has seen the European economy left behind by more competitive and innovative economies across the Atlantic and in Asia . #% In particular , the whole idea of a central clause called ` freedom to provide services ' was developed by us in the run-up to the committee vote . #% We have set up our working method , which involves a number of comparative studies ; these have been commissioned . #% The Public Prosecutor closed the Tunisian Magistrates ' Association 's office in August . #% In Northern Ireland , whatever the past , the ballot box now holds sway and the rule of law goes with that . #% Let me say very clearly that free trade is not the same as fair trade . #% However , I do not have time to rehearse them now . #% Let me suggest the easiest simplification of all : abolish the CAP ! #% Eco-labelling is moving on from forest products and detergents to computers and household appliances , but why stop there ? #% However , overall , the report is a balanced approach to this subject and for this reason , the British Conservative delegation supported this report . #% Equal treatment is a major factor in encouraging compliance . #% There is no excuse for the poor state of refugee management in the EU , since the numbers of asylum applications are low by historical standards . #% I am concerned about ensuring that farmers requiring compensation will not have that compensation payment delayed . #% The international financial markets now play a very important role in the world economy . #% How do you remove and dispose of 100 million hens in 24 hours ? #% That is what we should be doing tonight . #% This report does little to change that perception . #% About 10 % - around about 40 people - are actually engaged in professional activities . #% 
What you are all after is a European empire , is it not ? #% Finally , there is much to be done to bring about reform in Turkey , in particular in terms of human rights . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the GSP scheme was designed to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the world trade their way out of poverty . #% Given such a pathetic response from the Commission and the clear evidence that this House does not have any better solutions , it would be better to leave transport improvements to national governments . #% Amendment No 2 makes provision for breaks for workers obliged to wear individual breathing equipment because of their potential exposure . #% The European Parliament must do what it can to avert this catastrophe . #% Mr President , this debate has focused largely on the situation in the Middle East . #% That serves as a warning to many of us - certainly those in the Committee on Culture , which is unanimous in the view that I am expressing - that the consumer and the citizen need to benefit from an open and wide debate , taking some account of the problems we have had in past attempts at regulation , as well as of those that we face now . #% In theory , at least , the European Union could maintain the present banana regime if it agreed to compensate complaining countries or firmly refused to renege on its commitments to Caribbean and other countries under the Lomé Convention , and call for talks as happened , for example , on the issue of Helms-Burton . #% Between 700 and 1 000 of the party 's members are reported to be imprisoned , many for simply speaking their own language in public . #% We are therefore voting in support of the report as a whole . #% Secondly , the issue of the signing of the new Treaty that emerges from the Convention , containing a constitution . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate both the Parliament 's rapporteurs on the hard work that they put in . #% This is unsatisfactory and weakens our claim to be defending liberty and democracy . #% I should like to use my final few seconds to draw to your attention three projects in my own area . #% The committee continues to insist on a role in the ongoing and future shortlisting procedures for all positions , such as that of executive director . #% We have a sign language interpreter arriving now for the debate at 5.30 p.m. because everything has been changed around so much that we do not know when this report is being debated . #% The European Union wishes to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and its prosperity . #% Although supporting passenger rights is , of course , of vital importance , there are more efficient measures that can be taken without passengers being burdened with even higher costs . #% Of course , simply ensuring consumers can easily identify the nutritional content of their food is not a magic cure , but it will enable consumers to be more aware of the food they buy , compare products and identify the healthiest option at a glance , thus taking control of what they eat . #% So much needs to be done in so many areas . #% In the UK in particular , the large supermarket chains are gaining ever greater control of producers , insisting from a semi-monopoly position that their suppliers conform exactly to their requirements . #% I would not dream of trying to regulate on this subject , with all my experience . #% So I have tabled an amendment which would delete that . #% Looking ahead , it seems to me that we now have to implement this resolution on the proper implementation of the budget . #% Finally , I congratulate Mr Sterckx on the way he presented this to the committee and for his cooperation . #% I was here at the hour of our democratic birth in 1979 and I was here for the censure debate , when we came of age . #% Until we take Member States to court , they will continue to ignore our rules . #% If we are to be successful in terms of controlling the distribution of illegal drugs and their threat to our food , then prosecutions must be brought and , in this case , extradition ought to be granted so the American Government can bring this man to trial . #% On a separate matter , the report describes the impact of population growth in Bangladesh on food security and economic development . #% It is clearly enormously difficult , both in Africa and in South America , to prevent people who are starving or who have extremely limited amounts of food from ` poaching ' in their neighbouring jungle . #% I should like to refer to two points in particular . #% The wise men have a hard task in front of them over the coming six months . #% The principle is real exposure . #% That is why the first and most essential reform is a massive extension of qualified majority voting . #% However , let me just say , in reaction to the previous speaker , that businesses just stop - they go out of business . #% It is important because as the World Bank showed , this is the fastest growing area of health burden throughout the world . #% Fourthly and finally , we welcome progress in restoring the cuts in the environmentally sustainable transport heading . #% Those British people who queued up at petrol stations , fearing that there might be a shortage of petrol , behaved with rather less dignity . #% Spyker pays , but using money from the European Investment Bank . #% But I would like the Commission , in future , to make available on request any report at whatever stage in accessible format . #% We should not be bribing these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction , giving them money to absorb laws which are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth . #% He does not really mean an outward-looking Union ; what he means is an expansive Union and not , apparently , a period of reflection following the Dutch and the French referendums -- not at all ! #% Does Commissioner Fischler foresee individual farmers , regions or Member States having their cheques cut back because of this non-compliance ? #% Indeed , if it could do something for my brainpower as well , I would sit here munching it all night . #% The intemperate language detracts from the important message the report is trying to send out . #% Added to my list is the European Commission . #% It is vital that the work of this Foundation is monitored , that there are clear guidelines and that it has a wider remit than the narrow market economy . #% How can those demands be justified in relation to a Treaty that requires the Union to aim to eliminate inequalities , promote a high level of employment , guarantee adequate social protection and fight against social exclusion ? #% Indeed , the balance of opinion in Britain is that political union has already progressed too far . #% I think the United Kingdom is right to do what it has done . #% We have gone through the implications of it , we have gone through the reasons that it occurred and whatever else . #% I welcome the objectives set out in the communication for European policy . #% Does the Commissioner intend to take President Mandela 's advice and agree that it is not wise for us in the West at this time to give too much advice to Mr Kabila as he tries to restore law and order in that country ? #% It seems to me that Amendment No 106 should not be voted on . #% I would like to hear the Commissioner 's views about how he is going to work with us to get the Council to accept a serious timetable for dealing with these issues and how it is going to perform its part of the packages on the table . #% Mr Rübig is right to draw attention to the happy coincidence of languages within communities and countries in the existing 15 Member States . #% If they wanted to buy a fridge or a TV on credit , they would have had to leave it in the shop for two weeks before they could take it home . #% That split would then be followed by a third vote - it need not be a roll-call vote - which would take up our words which stand alone from the rest of it : ' ... expects the legislative procedure to be concluded by the end of June 2003 at the latest ' . #% These bits of the Constitution can not be forced into being against the will of the people . #% in writing . - The relationship between the UK and other European countries with the US will continue to be our most important strategic priority for decades to come . #% We have to remember that about 30 % of the total population of young people are drop-outs from the educational system , so we have a real problem here . #% I wrote to President Santer on 28 October ; his reply , addressed to you , came on 7 January . #% That is what will power the knowledge economy . #% Every club , every society has one . #% Madam President , instead of the empty gestures that we are getting from the Liberals and the British Conservatives on the issue of British beef , can we hear what the Commission has to say on Friday . #% 
Thus the Committee on Industry 's position is very much to support the Commission 's point of view and welcomes the fact that negotiations are going to start tomorrow but to ask that we proceed with sensitivity and caution . #% Regarding the Community strategy on air pollution from seagoing ships , as I have said before , I very much welcome the publication by the Commission of this communication on a European Union strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions . #% Anyone who expresses opposition to the regime is subject to harassment and arrest and goes in fear of their life . #% Unfortunately , in two minutes all I can do is talk about some of its failings . #% This seems especially relevant for those building debt in euros . #% That is the framework in which we must all judge your proposals . #% Should this not be of some concern to us ? #% We have helped our citizens , Mr President . #% Because of this complexity and because of the importance of the report , I would like to propose that the vote be delayed until tomorrow to give people more time to gather their thoughts and to take into account what the Commissioner and others have said this morning . #% If the applicant countries read the Hughes report , they may not want to join . #% Other forms of setting up branches in other countries , such as by subsidiaries , will remain , so there is no need for Member States to fear this proposal . #% There is a very serious situation developing in the Ukraine and EU support has been of tremendous importance . #% Madam President , I would like to focus on one specific issue . #% In setting policy priorities for external relations , the 2007 budget must lay the groundwork for an increasingly outward-looking European Union . #% He informed the Petitions Committee back in July that the Commission would be ready at the end of the summer to give its response . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that extensive report . #% We have heard a number of arguments over the past few months in favour of maintaining transitional periods . #% We have constantly criticised the Council for not progressing that agenda on the basis of the Commission 's comprehensive proposal . #% The trans-European networks are a potent symbol of that single market , creating transport links that spread evenly the length and breadth of the EU and providing calculable benefits for business and people alike . #% Finally , the Fernandes report endorses various IMO recommendations . #% The swift adoption of the European Company Statute , naturally involving the workforce , would achieve that desideratum . #% We have never been more isolated , more alienated , more disliked by our European neighbours in our entire history than we are today , sitting here in this Chamber this morning -- and I guess that is why Mr Blair has sent you here today to do his dirty work . #% They are very slow in arriving . #% Just coming back to this idea of the level market entry strategy , would you agree that spending aimed at effectively reducing unemployment should not be seen as an additional burden on public finances but as a way to guarantee sustainability ? #% I support self-regulation . #% I just wish to draw the attention of this House to the agenda for this week , particular the agenda for Friday , when the only item on the agenda is the Hallam report ... #% In short , we believe it is an ill-conceived project which is against the best interests of Europe in general and the single market in particular . #% They risk being forgotten and that is something we have to be very much aware of . #% We have to keep looking . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank Ms Angelilli for this report . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner very much indeed for that extremely comprehensive answer and also for mentioning his own personal experience of the problem . #% I am very pleased that this House overruled the Presidency of Parliament on the question of where the last JPA should be sited in the European Union . #% If we want debt relief to contribute to achieving the millennium development goals , then we need to acknowledge that debt is unsustainable wherever it prevents a country financing its poverty reduction programmes . #% To my mind that has to involve issues like the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement . #% Health is at the very heart of the Millennium Development Goals and it must be recognised by all that health is central to development and to the fight to reduce poverty , as well as an important measure of human wellbeing . #% He was a man with great ambition , but who knew when to compromise . #% There must be further progress by a convergence of family law developments at national level , and EU immigration and free movement rules , in recognising unmarried partners as family , especially , but not only , those in registered partnerships . #% I am disturbed that there is concern in Mexico that full information has not been provided , that civil society is being excluded and that multinationals and private capital interests have carried too much sway . #% Today we find that Pakistan finds itself at a crossroads . #% We need to make the European Union as competitive as possible . #% This figure pales into insignificance compared with the EUR 30 billion which the President-in-Office of the Council has said has been reimbursed over the last three years from the budget to Member States . #% Article 46 is particularly important in that respect and I would draw Members ' attention to Amendments Nos 82 , 86 , 87 and 89 . #% Mr President , we must make it very clear that this is not about the EU raising taxes or imposing a new tax over and above the existing national taxes . #% The families of the victims in Iraq can not forget this fact , and the Iraqi Constitution does not permit the presence of groups such as the NKO or the PKK on Iraqi soil . #% I see no reason whatsoever for the European Union to raise its own direct tax . #% I would like to see a time when this Parliament could spend more time focusing on and reviewing the legislation that has already been agreed rather than commenting on and contemplating future legislation . #% Delivering a single market for the benefit of all citizens is an excellent chapter in the action plan . #% Recent medical evidence shows that each one of us has 300 more chemicals in our bodily tissues and blood than our grandparents did . #% I commend this report to the House and congratulate Mr Donnelly again . #% Mr President , as a little boy growing up in Portugal I collected Portuguese stamps and particularly remember the colourful and attractive ones from East Timor . #% Moreover , this market must be made for the people , and not the other way round . #% My second question to Commissioner Monti asks specifically whether the Commission apprised the Visegrad countries themselves of the difficulties being encountered in managing the Community and the common transit systems before accession . #% As the EU creates its own judicial system with instruments such as the European arrest warrant and trials in absentia , and now its own police force , we in Britain are seeing the destruction of our most basic and cherished liberties that have formerly protected us . #% The severity of some of the remarks you will hear from the floor today do not reflect on her , but on the fact that she is caught in one institution which is now on a collision course with another . #% Clearly a lot still needs to be done , and we have to take advantage of the current crisis to perhaps change the emphasis in our work . #% We are a long way from achieving the millennium development goals . #% It is very important indeed for us to make sure that the countries spend this money , to allow the private sector to get its act together because , at the end of 2006 , with enlargement , we , the existing fifteen countries , will lose the ability to have structural funding . #% Secondly , financial conditions are set at a lower level - 65 % of final salary instead of 70 % - than has been customary in all previous termination of service arrangements . #% We have perhaps an opportunity with the forthcoming IGC to do that . #% You even threw out his seven-year budget -- his precious rescue attempt -- with an overwhelming vote on the Böge report . #% Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC ? #% Why is it still the currency of choice for the Russian mafia ? #% There it seems to me , in deference to the Council member present , you must try harder . #% I said that we would be considering the matter he has referred to . #% ( Applause ) I certainly hope that even though he will be giving up that post he will still visit the European Parliament to give us the benefit of his extensive knowledge . #% I do not want to invest in your bank and neither do the British people . #% 
Unlike bacterial or some other form of organic or biological contamination of the food chain , we have here a finite quantity of substance that could easily be eliminated . #% Mr President , the Funk reports are about actions to limit the production of beef and ways to pay for those actions . #% There is no link between depleted uranium and the illnesses . #% We need clear reassurance from the Council and the Commission - by way of an insertion of a paragraph in the text during conciliation - that prompt , immediate action will be taken when the results of the risk assessment become available , as promised , in June 2003 . #% I am talking particularly about whole-body vibration aspects , rather than hand and arm vibration . #% We have a duty to remember that this constant flow of illegal immigration is posing an enormous burden , in particular in inner cities , on our national health service , social services and social security system as well as putting huge pressure on our limited housing stock . #% You can not simply allow this dynamic to fail . #% And yet you , Commissioner , seem to have a very different view of the role of SMEs and how best to support them . #% Mr President , am I correct in thinking you said that the deadline for tabling amendments would be Wednesday 3 July ? #% The principles which have guided this report are to encourage greater public awareness of these issues and to support parental responsibility and to develop co-operation between the content providers , consumer organisations and the respective authorities , both national and European . #% It is estimated that between five and ten people are injured in mine blasts every day in Afghanistan and that an estimated 10 million mines litter the country . #% That is not to say that compromise is a bad word , it is a brilliant word . #% The Commission is right - information is available to some , but not to all . #% It is about the procedures of the European Arrest Warrant and whether it is being misused for political purposes . #% I think Mr Santini would agree that is a difficult and contentious area and one which , if reopened , will negate much of the valuable work that has been done . #% I fully support this report , which will potentially ensure that EU consumers operate in a level playing field and sales promotions are standardised across EU Member States . #% Would he encourage all Member States to take the fullest advantage now under the new rules , which offer greater flexibility , and to listen to their farmers and their agricultural community in the process ? #% There have been estimates that in the next two years we will require half a million extra people in IT jobs . #% However , the key to tonight 's debate is Amendment No 8 : a guarantee of level access to all new buses in urban areas for persons with reduced mobility . #% Why , for example , have fewer summits if there are going to be more rather than fewer issues to discuss ? #% In due course , given the fact that the European Union is a major contributor of humanitarian relief , it would be most useful for the Commission services and ECHO in particular to explore possibilities for improving the effectiveness of relief organisation in disaster situations . #% The purpose of the proposed regulation being considered by the House is , therefore , to authorise such a termination of service scheme for 300 Commission officials in the course of this year , and another 300 in the course of next year . #% Only the Colombian Government can decide what is best for the future of its country and what price it is prepared to pay to achieve peace . #% Could the Commissioner tell me if the official policy of the Commission despite its fine words , is that we are talking in waves regardless of how each country develops ? #% I repeat what I said last month that those who talk loosely about independence are only going to make the situation worse , not better . #% I should like to add my congratulations to the Irish for the leadership they are showing on this difficult question . #% It is often said that this is a historic enlargement -- it is indeed . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for today 's communication . #% However , one server is down and it was down for a while yesterday morning as well . #% I put that before you and leave it in your good hands , Mr President , and exhort the services , if possible , to look at this before we come to vote on the matter tomorrow . #% I shall read the amendment with the technical changes : ` calls for a permanent solution to be found , as a matter of urgency , in the field of TRIMs -- trade-related investment measures -- and of TRIPs -- trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights -- to ensure access to medicines for countries with no manufacturing capacity facing public health concerns ' . #% It would also constitute a climb-down from Gleneagles pledges to halt climate change and promote energy conservation . #% Could I ask whether the Commissioner would meet with Ms Morgan and myself specifically to try to find practical ways forward here . #% Some need those new partnerships to develop drugs ; many need access to the drugs that we in the West take for granted . #% That was where our rapporteur , Mrs Gill , thought that the Commission and the Council were being generous - I would say extremely generous - in their attitude to the budgets proposed by three of the other institutions : the Court of Justice , the Committee of the Regions , and the Economic and Social Committee . #% Indeed , only last month the Trade and Industry Minister attended an EU meeting in the EU capital , Brussels , organised by the ACP , an institution created by the EU . #% It is interesting that only some 70 countries have signed the Rome Statute . #% We need to continue to maintain sanctions but , at the same time as maintaining sanctions , we need to provide humanitarian aid . #% Not only do the authors of this report wish to see this new regime inflicted on chicken meat producers in the 25 Member States , but they also make it clear that they expect non-EU countries to follow suit . #% The test ban and the marketing ban have not been complied with . #% I think some of us really also understand the need sometimes for a bit of confidentiality . #% We need to ensure that we take into account the capacity constraints of the ACP countries and seek to build those as part of the process . #% But I wanted to focus on the Middle East . #% It would be easier for us to focus on the supply side and the difficulties caused by Hurricane Katrina , but if we did that we would just be applying a sticking plaster , when what we really need is major surgery . #% Well , Mr Blair , having collapsed in the negotiations , having been totally outwitted , outclassed and outplayed by President Chirac , has signed a really rather bad deal for the British taxpayer . #% Thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles , to encourage private sector recycling companies , through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements , and to incentivise the use of recycled materials . #% What we have to do is share sovereignty where we can improve society but agree that things should be left to individual governments where appropriate . #% Before the democratically elected Authority had the chance to organise itself , the EU-Palestine Agreement was up for review on the basis of human rights in a way that has been dismissed by both the Council and the Commission as unhelpful because it would remove leverage . #% We should protest against the impact of poverty which is felt disproportionately by women . #% There are some 370 000 premature and preventable deaths a year from outdoor and indoor , industrial , traffic , farming and dust pollution . #% They will be paying more because the Prime Minister has let them and the country down . #% The real challenge faced by the farming industry is to become more competitive and closer to the consumer . #% If the schedule for the day says a debate starts at 10.30 , I submit to you that it should start at 10.30 , even if there has to be a short adjournment . #% Now we are all aware in this Chamber of the pressures that are brought to bear on the Commission , the Council and on Members of this Parliament wherever the matter of alcoholic products is concerned . #% I would be interested to hear his views . #% Just now it should not be about who is to blame , but who is going to stop the suffering . #% Mr Blair has said that there needs to be a real debate on the kind of European Union that we want in the future and I agree with him . #% We need to be careful , for example , to look at the situation in the UK , where if you are prosecuted you appear in the paper , but if minor infringements are discovered , such as a cracked tile in a slaughterhouse or a piece of mouse dirt in a restaurant , this does not appear on the front page of the local newspaper . #% People have spoken about the issue of partnerships . #% We have heard already that the gap is widening , which is why our EU 2020 strategy also needs to take into account the need to reduce the gaps between rich and poor . #% I would like to warmly welcome Mr Bodrato 's report and the very clear presentation he gave . #% I find it very depressing that this ` fragile compromise ' , as it was described , was the best anyone could come up with . #% Finally , on spamming , I myself have been spammed . #% There is no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all . #% On Monday , 11 January , Mr Pastrana reiterated the exclusive responsibility of the state to disarm the paramilitaries in his ten-point proposed agenda presented to the FARC . #% Nevertheless , the report is excessively negative and very unbalanced , particularly in relation to the Cyprus issue , where there is no recognition of Turkish Cypriot support for the Annan Plan or of the EU 's unfulfilled promise to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus . #% 
We do not want that in this case and so it is very important that the quarantine provisions remain . #% The agenda says Question Time finishes at 7 p.m. #% But this is only going to happen if the international community can work together to step up its efforts and exercise pressure to end the political violence and the political impasse in that country . #% If we are all to participate in this particular game , we must create an even playing field . #% The Committee on Budgetary Control tabled a number of amendments to the budget to gain extra information and evaluations from the Commission . #% At the end of the week , the developing countries were simply not prepared to accept a `` done deal '' made in secret rooms by the big players . #% Does the President-in-Office not agree that if the EU had said way back in 2002 that it was unacceptable for our citizens to be detained without charge or trial in Guantánamo , then they might all be free by now , or put on trial and convicted if that was what should happen to them ? #% The good health of our economies and public finances , which we have striven so hard to put in order since the early 1990s , has been ruined in less than two years . #% However , I would ask him to go further . #% Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States . #% So , if you think the lobbying over the past year or more has been intense , wait until the industry starts trying to stuff the Agency with its own people . #% Some boards are already too big , especially that of the Agency for Safety and Health at Work , and enlargement risks making this worse . #% You can be sure that Parliament will be an ally on this , even more so if we have codecision . #% This overall proposal is an excellent example of how Parliament can make a real contribution to practical legislative improvements when it works together with a Commission that is open and sympathetic . #% Madam President , I should like to make it clear that I am not speaking on behalf of the ELDR or in favour of this resolution . #% The European Commission wishes to retain the opt-outs , the CERCAS report eliminates them . #% Over the last half-century , social engineering of this kind has proved beyond doubt that it simply does not work . #% Perhaps he was unwise to do so , but he was right to do so . #% Then we as co-legislators can decide , but it must be our decision , not that of experts , nor of technocrats , stakeholders or lobbyists . #% The ECB will not have the full confidence of the market until it becomes more open . #% We are looking here at the way in which they might in this decade get to the point we and the public desire , and they will only do it with the looming incentive of a marketing ban . #% The fourth case , on the face of it , again seemed to be straightforward . #% This proposal for a directive seeks to include the new training and certification requirements , including watchkeeping requirements and to introduce common criteria for the recognition of seafarers ' certificates issued by third countries . #% But all that jargon does is to hide an uncomfortable truth : the common fisheries policy has not worked , does not work and can not work no matter how much reform is dressed up in flowery words . #% The EU will keep up the pressure to ensure that they are . #% At the review of the rules scheduled for 2002 , the WTO should at least agree to extend the deadline for TRIPS compliance for all developing countries and base it on development progress rather than on arbitrary dates . #% It is important , therefore , that when considering the matter of small arms we should take care not to become over-obsessed with our own authorities or industry : these are the easy targets . #% This is a serious point and I know the Commissioner will be listening to it . #% I am sure that the Council will find a solution to this unnecessary conflict , but it must fully respect Parliament 's budget rights so that we can ensure that the final stage in the enlargement process will proceed without any delays . #% Mr President , I will be a member of this Parliament 's delegation to observe next Sunday 's run-off presidential election in Ukraine . #% With this in mind , I believe it is right to highlight the progress made by Latvia so that a decision can be made to start negotiations with Riga before the end of the German presidency . #% So do not tell us that we need more research before we call for a moratorium -- we do not : there is plenty of evidence that we need to act . #% The only way to preserve some prosperity in Britain is to leave the EU . #% If we want to survive and prosper in the 21st century then we must welcome and manage change . #% Negotiation is the only way forward , but negotiation should involve all groups , including other Tamil organisations -- peaceful Tamil organisations , such as the Tamil United Liberation Front , for instance . #% If these governments , including the Egyptian Government , do not take human rights seriously then we must take further action , if necessary suspending any agreements that we have with them . #% This temporary protection needs to cover not only spontaneous mass influxes into the Community territory but also non-spontaneous influxes , when people have been airlifted out of difficult areas by Member States , or perhaps other parties , and possibly assisted to come to the EU . #% Undoubtedly , Lithuanian society remains , by and large , conservative and we should understand that . #% Yet when dealing with our most powerful and important international partner , the European Union has not reached a common position or made -- as I understand it -- any formal to the United States . #% Much has been said in this debate about the great progress Turkey is making , but very little has been said about the Union 's capacity to absorb a country of the size and nature of Turkey . #% We are getting conflicting comments from the Commission and from our colleagues in the Committee on Development . #% We also need tangible progress on the rights of EU citizens to move freely and reside elsewhere . #% I suspect that part of the reason for Turkey 's total over-reaction to the conclusions of the Luxembourg Summit was that it has been encouraged by some American politicians , at least , to believe that it would get more out of the European Union . #% For these reasons we have been active in tabling a series of amendments to the report , pushing for the development of new WTO rules in areas such as the environment , now directly affected by international trade policy . #% I also welcome the call for producers to have taken ` all necessary measures to minimise its environmental impact ' , whilst at the same time I recognise that it may be difficult to standardise such a measure . #% We also asked for the universal service to be guaranteed . #% I have been extremely impressed by the diligence and commitment of the entire Montenegrin Government . #% Our colleague Mr Rehder produced an excellent report , underlining the changes required , both to achieve a common agricultural policy appropriate for an enlarged Europe in the 21st century , and also to release the kind of sums required for regional and social programmes in that wider Europe . #% Finally , I would ask colleagues to pay particular attention to paragraph 128 of the draft report . #% The adoption of the assimilation of facts and events will be of benefit to frontier workers in particular and the number of derogations and exceptions has been reduced , despite our concern about the future development of the Annexes . #% Mr President , I should like to add my voice to the chorus of praise that there has been for the efforts of the rapporteur , Mr Medina Ortega , and the chairman of our Conciliation Committee , Mrs Fontaine . #% If self-interest serves , then perhaps we might note that the latest scientific evidence forecasts that Europe will get colder . #% And it does not just relate to expenditure . #% It has to deal with all those who think that a cost-free -- for them ! -- way to increase resources is to cut the British rebate -- although even with the rebate Britain 's net contribution is far higher than that of France and Italy . #% I have no quibble with the Socialists for what they did in pursuing their agenda . #% We need to see a healthy environment too as a prerequisite for our economy . #% There are no high walls to keep the market out . #% Certainly CIETT have said to me that they are appalled by this directive , and I will be having further conversations with them on the basis of your reply today . #% We will find that European consumers are consuming meat from poultry produced in China and Thailand containing substances banned in Europe . #% It is a responsibility which I would like to see this Parliament discharge . #% We must only propose and adopt legislation on the basis of good counsel and good experience . #% In 2005 , 70 trade unionists were killed , while 260 received death threats , 56 were arbitrarily detained , seven survived attacks in which explosives or firearms were used , six were kidnapped , and three disappeared . #% We want the businesses Mr Kamiński has talked about to take advantage of this . #% I am now quite confident that there will be a majority next month in favour of a useful package of reforms that will not solve all our problems - far from it - but will be a useful step forward . #% We want a European Union that is efficient and accountable and where Europe ' s institutions are kept under close scrutiny . #% We need safe havens so that young women and girls can be protected . #% 
That is an urgent priority . #% I disagree with this . #% Here it is important to bear in mind the reasoning behind the existence of the immunity . #% We can therefore express ourselves satisfied that we have made good progress on this proposal and we can look to pick up the issue of chemicals in products , and a range of other issues , when we address the chemicals policy proposal that we understand the Commission will be publishing for wider consultation on 7 May . #% Moreover , the Irish referendum and the concerns exposed in the demonstrations - even though they were hijacked by extremists - should be telling us something . #% That is our message to all those affected : to the European Union ; to the Indian Government ; by all means , to Dow Chemicals and its responsibilities and to the courts which will be looking at that . #% This report will no doubt be adopted nevertheless without the real issue being confronted . #% Secondly , interlinked with the first priority , is that of ensuring security for European citizens in areas such as freedom and security and justice , as well as the specific sector of energy supply that we have just been discussing . #% With this in mind the framework directive should set out the general principles governing the behaviour of traders at all stages of their commercial dealings , so that consumers ' rights are effectively enforced . #% I ask Mr Schulz where that investment is going to come from . #% I would like to think this was an unwitting translation error but this derogatory phraseology is probably not accidental . #% Mr Rocard 's questions , I hope , will take the debate further and I will at least be able to listen to the Commissioner in the time available to me . #% It is a shameful indictment of this centralised bureaucratic form of government that it has taken so long to act , even then only under pressure from the WTO , and that so many people will suffer as a result . #% Whilst I was researching for these comments to make to you today , I looked for examples , because I think these illustrate so well to the citizens of the European Union how these developments will bring benefits to their lives . #% Perhaps he could answer that particular point . #% The security staff who I believe were involved include Mr Zylka and Mr Dekhudt . #% In London , Mr Javier Solana spoke on the Palestinian issue on behalf of the European Union . #% We accept the near inevitability and in many cases the desirability of mergers and takeovers , but we also see the potential and actual dangers . #% The Caribbean producers have been somewhat perplexed at the ruling of the WTO . #% At the meeting in Gaborone , the EU agreed to postpone until 2006 the anticipated review of the situation of non-LDCs that are not in a position to enter into EPAs . #% I believe it is important in the future that if the Bureau does come forward - and I hope it will - with efficiency savings proposals , that it is discussed with Members at an early stage . #% More importantly , I would like to thank those people who sit behind us -- sometimes seen , sometimes unseen : our assistants and our advisers , without whom we could not do this work . #% That is why it is so important to support the Sacconi-Nassauer compromise and ensure the passage of this legislation through Parliament , so that we can improve human health and the environment across the world , while at the same time maintaining our own industrial competitiveness . #% author . - Mr President , since I have been in this Parliament , some twelve years now , we have been trying to help the people of Zimbabwe have better lives and greater optimism for the future . #% It is a bit too late to be asking for transparency now , Mr Verhofstadt . #% These new rules will set the necessary minimum safety criteria for the use of tissues and cells across Europe . #% I sincerely hope that , particularly during the French presidency later this year , the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options , and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament . #% He has done an excellent job in very difficult circumstances . #% I strongly support the recent Commission Green Paper . #% Perhaps the Commission could comment on that at the close of the debate . #% This is wrong because the role of these government civil servants in the last referendum was very dubious indeed . #% The country-of-origin principle is an integral part . #% Lastly , in terms of enlargement , we would like to be sure that in interpretation we have controlled multilingualism ; that in translation , we are looking at the aspects of teleworking ; and , above all , in the buildings , that we do not take on any commitments to construct new buildings until we know they are absolutely essential . #% Therefore this is a very mixed debate on how we are going to make sure we can make the European Union run effectively . #% Would he agree with me that a suitable limited extension could be five or six years ? #% In both cases a single government was able to hold up proceedings to make the others pay a political price for an eventual concession that was made or a new compromise that had to be found . #% Some people are indeed working hard for democracy in Turkey , and the AKP deputy Faruk Ünsal spoke out against this particular verdict . #% And , incidentally , it is by having a flexible workforce that you raise people out of poverty . #% I mainly want to speak on the issue of the Assyrians . #% The Indonesian Government must take measures to protect the human rights defenders and members of the press who speak out about these atrocities . #% As the Commission President has announced , this is a Commission decision already , and to come first to us in the Parliament is always an agreeable thing so far as budgetary matters are concerned . #% I therefore , as Mr Howitt has done , urge the Commissioner to respond to the request for clarification of what the Commission view will be on what I am sure will be a very strong European Parliament response to the comitology procedures suggested here . #% Unfortunately , that means that company could show a severe degree of prejudice but it could also show a very positive degree of enlightenment . #% That is why I would reject the legalisation and decriminalisation arguments on this occasion . #% How about some targeted action against products from Pennsylvania , Ohio and West Virginia ? #% Mark Forrester is innocent and we will carry on that fight to prove that he is innocent and to clear his name . #% This is a familiar story to those of us from the UK and one which should redouble our determination to ensure that the moneys reach quickly those on the ground for whom they are intended . #% There are , frankly , divergent views , not just within my group but within most groups on this issue . #% The report was lost as a scaffolding or works-at-height directive , as an annex to an original report . #% Admittedly , however , the conference did start badly . #% Mr President , I must say that I am slightly disturbed by the lack of response on one or two of the issues there , but I will come to those in one moment . #% By that I mean information that shows that the benefit is felt not by farmers but by multinational processors of food and big landowners . #% I hope she would approve of where we have got to today , and how the European Union is now able to allow lawyers to move and practise in other Member States by choice rather than force of circumstance and that by this regulation our committee will further assist a step forward in giving greater access to justice to our citizens across Europe . #% This is very important , because if we do not carry on the search for General Gotovina , how can we push for the capture of Radavan Karadzic and General Mladic ? #% For the first time since King Henry VIII ended the jurisdiction of the Pope in ecclesiastical matters in England , a power other than the British Parliament will have the right to create laws and set the penalties for transgression . #% One thing that has been made clear to us is that in next year 's budget there could be shortfalls , especially in the Structural Funds , where the Category 2 expenditure on payments may well have to be exceeded . #% In our last Joint Assembly we worked on the EPA trade negotiations , human rights , governance , the European Development Fund and environmental concerns . #% Indeed , the British perception of the euro as a failure , because of its fall against the dollar , simply misunderstands the whole project . #% Labelling must allow for accurate health messages , such as for folic acid . #% I want to make two substantive arguments in this debate . #% So we have clarity now , in that Member States can put in place systems to enable them to ensure that needs can be met . #% We had a strategy and we had some muscle enabling us to achieve that , by withholding monies or posts so that action could be taken . #% Mrs Malliori 's report has been parodied and attacked in some countries , including my own , and we are owed a small debate on it . #% I would just like to ask when you expect the results to be available . #% Numerous allegations were made before the report was published . #% Which finance ministers are prepared to sign an annual statement of assurance of their accounts , which will put an end to the annual saga of us failing to sign off the accounts because of the failure of Member States to control their accounts ? #% 
Clear rules for security across Europe 's airports are absolutely necessary . #% The Chinese people are at long last beginning to reap some of the material benefits of the capitalist system . #% Is it in fact practical for there to be separate IT platforms in the long term ? #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your points of view on the previous debate . #% In the UK , we thought we had been promised that harmonised taxes , especially income tax , would never come . #% If we can not get it right for the beef for human consumption , if we can not get it right in Germany , which has one of the best records in the EU , how can we expect that the waste will be correctly segregated in Greece or Italy or Spain ? #% I hope the Commission will think again about the acceptability of Amendments Nos 14 , 15 , 17 and 19 on the statute , concerning the inclusion of the consideration of employment effects in the case of a merger , transfer or conversion involving an ECS , because I think they are entirely justifiable . #% Matters have not been helped by Syria 's lamentable behaviour in turning a blind eye to Islamist terrorists crossing into Iraq from its territory in spite of its own fight against Islamism , as well as its covert support to terrorist training for Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah , in spite of its continuing denials of such support . #% If we want to export these technologies we need to make sure that the resources are available . #% That is what we should be aiming to do , President-in-Office . #% The reaction against this ranges from Indian farmers calling for an increase in tariffs to protect themselves from cheap food imports , through to steel workers , including fully restructured UK steel workers , who find that they will now still be unable to compete with Romanian steel exports . #% Mr President , I want to raise a different matter - the subject of Zimbabwe . #% In addition , citizens would be entitled to submit their comments either orally or in writing . #% In that broader field , you will be putting in place the most important building blocks for an open coordination for social protection , and we wish you well , although I was disappointed not to hear specific reference to social exclusion in that context . #% That protocol was a unique combination of determination between NGOs , government and business to solve a vital environmental problem . #% I come from Devon , where we are often referred to as simple country folk . #% Animals have rights , children do not . #% It is a system which is subject to wide-scale abuse . #% We wish the new Commission every success and hope that the high standards they espouse will be put into practice . #% Past agreements should dictate that both the Council and the Commission should understand that when the Development Committee takes a strong stance , as we have done on the DCCI , we in that committee will maintain a very strong position on our principles . #% I do not share the cynicism and despair of some in the ELDR Group . #% Often , the workers themselves are isolated , and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this situation . #% More appropriate would be temporary special measures to assist particular sectors to survive through short-term difficulties . #% Others pretended not to see . #% I would hope that this issue will also be raised with the Commission so we can have guidance on it . #% No one should have ignored these issues in the vote we cast today . #% We in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy have long been aware of this situation and have been debating the need for measures to address this dependence . #% The first point is about making sure that the poorest regions of Europe do not pay the price of enlargement . #% So , can I ask you -- and I hope I will have colleagues ' support on this -- to broaden this statement so that we can all be included , particularly those like myself who have constituents involved in motor vehicle manufacturing . #% The Buildings Directive has only been properly transposed by a handful of Member States . #% This is a Union of different cultures and differing priorities . #% Why has he been in prison for so long without any evidence being brought against him ? #% If the Commission is willing to make such a statement you do not need to put it to the House . #% So please do not tell me that we will increase the population by giving 20 weeks fully paid maternity leave . #% Lastly , once Member States begin to co-operate more in this domain and demonstrate how they have mainstreamed sport into their education systems , we will finally come to realise the full potential that sport has to offer . #% I therefore abstained in the vote . #% That does not mean to say , however , that this Parliament will not be continuing to take a keen interest in the whole process of the reforms because the regulations themselves have to provide the right framework in which the reforms are carried out . #% We have an exciting time in front of us . #% It displays a dangerous and economically illiterate philosophy that needs to be strongly rebuffed . #% I want to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done . #% Is it in order to have a split vote when it has not been put in writing before the actual part-session begins ? #% More than this , the social and philosophical needs that we have in mastering the cultural question become central to ensuring that we have stability in our globalised world . #% Firstly , can we now have more precise details about the Treaty change and the procedure ? #% Our commitment to such safeguards was reiterated and formalised in the stability and association agreement with Croatia , initialled by the Commission on 14 May . #% It is all a very unhappy situation . #% Please face reality . #% We regret , in fact , the delay of four months now in Parliament bringing the report to a conclusion . #% We see a similar position with the US , the Japanese and the European markets acting to some extent on their own . #% The example of Iraq exposes yet again the frailty of common security policy in the European Union and not surprisingly it confirms a widely differing outlook in interests of the Member States of the European Union . #% I can envisage circumstances where it is right and just that the government has a role , where pollution has taken place , and where it may not be appropriate to put the blame or impose the responsibility for what occurs on some other party . #% There have been enormous improvements in the technology over the past few months since we first looked at this . #% My group supports all of them for one simple reason : we surely should have learned by now the lesson that precision and targeting of possible dangers in animal feed is of the essence of the precautions that we need to take . #% It has the powers and over the next year should try to exclude state subsidies in this fishing area as much as it is trying in other areas of economic activity . #% We demand his immediate and unconditional release . #% However , in seeking to address these problems , the crisis must not be used as a pretext for extending further the powers of the European Union . #% It is amazing to me that , in this modern day and age , thousands of these containers go missing each year , with the great majority of them falling off the ships into our oceans . #% Let us not forget that foot and mouth disease is no respecter of borders . #% So I was particularly anxious that a compromise would be reached which saved jobs and this compromise does exactly that . #% So , before you condemn the USA , look in the mirror and see your own hypocrisy . #% My only reservation is with regard to Amendment 39 , part of which argues that freedom of speech should not be compromised , even in cases of harassment . #% Commissioner , you have the melancholy satisfaction of being proved right and that never makes one popular or even happy . #% But most sinister of all in this report is Guideline 19 : continual review of incentives and disincentives resulting from the tax and benefits systems . #% The ASEAN ten must now deal with internal tensions , especially when such tensions spill over to contaminate relations with the EU . #% Hundreds of thousands , yes , but not the four and a half million that are in the region . #% As this is such a broad subject , I will just devote myself to one area . #% It is right that we should focus on the way in which counterfeiting is growing between the Member States , within the single market , as well as beyond the frontiers of the European Union . #%
