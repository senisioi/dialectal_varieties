I have raised it with the rapporteur and he is in agreement with this . #% Water will become more valuable than oil in future in developing countries . #% However , we have four red lines . #% Mr President , it is all very well for you to say that you are not going to take account of it , but when somebody genuinely makes a mistake with the electronic voting system and corrects it straightaway , surely that should be taken into account . #% We need a treaty for a Union of 27 Member States , but in the meantime there is much you can do to rebuild on the basis of the current treaties and restore public faith in the European project . #% To this end debt relief must be treated and reported separately from aid . #% It would be ludicrous , however , to ignore the impact such activities have on the fisheries sector and on fish stocks . #% Finally , I fear that the mid-term review of the CAP since the Agriculture Committee dealt with my report may have significantly altered the thrust of some of these recommendations . #% Madam President , the situation in Afghanistan is of great interest to this House . #% Madam President , one of the successes of the Hänsch presidency has been the elimination of this abuse of certain Members voting more than once in a procedure that has been described to me as ` playing the piano ' . #% The Liberal Democrat Group has always sought to apply the Copenhagen criteria and the timetable , not to elevate one above the other . #% But there is keen sadness about the broken promises : the direct relationship offered to the new Scottish Parliament with Europe has been watered down , the status of the ` Länder ' has been watered down , the right to attend meetings if the Scottish interest was dominant has been watered down . #% These are founding principles of our Union which are simply not compatible with second-class citizenship for our new Member States . #% To this end I welcome the recent adoption of a regulation seeking to establish a control system applicable to the CFP emphasising the use of Community inspectors in addition to national inspectors . #% Moreover , there are referenda to be won in all the new countries - referenda in which each and every one of us can play an important part , if we so choose . #% I grew up in the Middle East , so I know the region pretty well . #% Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems , governments , and the Commission too , should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon , providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents . #% How will the Council support civil society in delivering aid within Ethiopia ? #% I therefore welcome and support calls for policies to encourage greater economic participation by women with the aim of further improving their status and boosting their income and assets . #% This is one of many issues which require to be addressed . #% If political forces in Spain are allowed to raise the ghost of regional autonomy , if , in France , the debate is muddied by Turkish membership , if , in Britain , EU financing becomes an issue in the Constitutional Treaty debate , the whole thing will come crashing down around Europe 's ears . #% I believe that the internal market is about workers ; it is about workers ' rights ; it is about health and safety ; it is about living conditions ; it is about elderly people ; it is about young people ; it is about disabled people ; it is about employment and unemployment ; it is about the training of young , old and unemployed people . #% Mr President , I suppose I can start on a note of slight optimism in that President Mugabe has now named the days for the election as 24 and 25 June . #% Water quality is essential to our environment and I am pleased to see that through European action we have witnessed improvements . #% Sadly , efforts to improve trade have not been successful and many developing countries have much reduced export trade compared with ten years ago . #% No European Union worthy of its name can be complete unless we take these countries in , and these programmes are a very good way to go forward . #% I am told that the Commission then had discussions with the CFO , who may have been less than honest with the Commission . #% You might also say something about pharmaceutical products , because of the provisions which allow pharmaceutical products to continue to be traded within the European Community that contain gelatine . #% We are helping to educate half a million children . #% Reckless military adventurism on one side and cynical acceptance of terrorism on the other offer only further bloodshed and misery and the deepening of mutual hatreds , which will delay and render more difficult the achievement of lasting peace . #% Can I ask the Commission to do what it can to reassure the Scottish islands , the Scottish executive that is struggling with this situation at the moment and the Scottish Parliament , that it stands ready to make sure that this process works well , that it does not undermine but improves the shipping services in the Scottish islands . #% It is important to sort out the structural problems in our economies but this will take time . #% Our proposal would still be on a shelf gathering dust if it had not been for the events in New York five days later . #% You need three Councils a year . #% Our second concern is the apparent downplaying of the importance of trade in the package as a whole . #% We have built many of Mr Martínez Martínez 's ideas into the new rules . #% As an article in today 's Guardian says , we are at a crossroads . #% Secondly , this House is sovereign on this matter . #% Now Latvian workers are out of a job thanks to the Swedish trade unions . #% In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt , on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides , Orkney and Shetland , there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service . #% This is critical to us and the Commission has still omitted to answer the question . #% The Secretary-General of my Group stated that she would have liked to have had the opportunity to discuss that report , along with other reports , at our group meeting before the part-session . #% However , I should like to ask a slightly different question . #% The Sapir report contained a number of ideas that merited consideration . #% I regret that Parliament rejected attempts to ban junk food advertising during children 's programmes . #% Last night as the Echelon Committee adopted its report , it made it clear that running systems of random interception of messages breaches the fundamental right to privacy in one ' s personal life and communications . #% Our once proud Scottish fleet , which landed 400 000 tonnes of cod per year in Scottish ports in 1970 , is now limited by strict TACs and quotas to a mere 20 000 tonnes per year . #% This is desirable in normal times , but in the present economic crisis , it is even more necessary . #% In my constituency in Scotland , we have the materials and the know-how to be able to develop this industry and are eager to put these proposals into action . #% We , along with the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and the Liberals , would like a little more strength to it , but we do not mind . #% Nevertheless , hydrogen power can only be truly effective as a clean and green energy if the hydrogen comes from sustainable and , ideally , renewable sources , and this fact has been noted in the final report . #% It is all the more alarming if the holders of the rights themselves abuse the rights to the disadvantage of consumers . #% We recreated our Scottish democracy in 1999 with the establishment of the Scots Parliament , when it was reconvened by my party president and former Member of this House , Winnie Ewing , with the words : ` The Scottish Parliament , adjourned in 1707 , is hereby reconvened ' . #% It is a very good report . #% It is vital we take steps to combat these crimes which have the power to undermine confidence in the EU 's financial systems , as well as notoriously close links with terrorist finance . #% That is indeed the position . #% So I take it that you are telling us we are going down a path that could lead to near disaster . #% But President Hu Jintao has to accept that a deal is a deal . #% in writing . - While progress has been made on the issue of gender equality in Europe , we are far from full parity . #% It was wonderful . #% I believe he is also right to say that the institutions need ` space to think ' and therefore some informal documents should be excluded from his proposal in order to allow the free exchange of ideas . #% In the communication , the Commission talks of `` a solid relationship in terms of culture and civilisation '' . #% MS patients deserve better . #% Who , if not you two , could convince Europe 's governments of the beauty of Lisbon and the importance of its agenda ? #% Yes , the embryo also is due dignity , but we have large numbers of supernumerary embryos resulting from in vitro fertilisation and these are usually frozen and ultimately destroyed . #% Your proposals , President Barroso , recognise the overwhelming urgency of action . #% 
The Commission made its proposals in 2002 and undertook to see speedy action . #% I am extremely grateful to Mr Wuermeling for the way in which , in Amendments Nos 4 and 62 , he has sought to create an exemption for that kind of activity . #% Does Commissioner McCreevy believe that his cabinet 's lobbying of Parliament last week advanced the case for Europe 's single market ? #% Mr President , I should just like to touch on a couple of points that Mr Evans raised . #% That in the light of experience with areas like the Shetland Box , specially protected areas based on scientific advice should continue in the future . #% If you kill off the Pact in its existing form , you have a responsibility to commit yourself to an agreed interpretation of a set of rules to prevent a borrowing free-for-all . #% As a result it has faced enormous internal pressure and threatened instability . #% Their generosity of spirit sets us a challenge . #% Such an alliance , when it happens in national parliaments , happens only at times of war or crisis . #% I am delighted that the one Member State 's objection has been lifted to the adoption of the framework decision . #% If we do not take account , adequately and properly , of substantial constitutional regions with legislative powers - the internal nations of the Member States - then this Union will not work as a successful democracy . #% There is a question mark over whether the occupants of those posts should be engaged to such an extent in such a political battle while holding those offices . #% I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility . #% in writing . - I voted for this report , which calls for better definition of investor protection standards and greater transparency in the arbitration system , the right to appeal against decisions by international arbitrators and the possibility to consult trades unions and civil society organisations . #% Mr President , the European Union stands for democracy , human rights , self-determination , or nothing whatsoever . #% That is an irregular way of proceeding and I request that Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market be asked , even it is asked to do it quickly , to verify that a legal base exists for this measure in its new form . #% This year we will integrate ten new Member States . #% In 1994 , Iraq recognised the territorial integrity of Kuwait . #% We need to resolve the blockage that we have and the hardening of positions that seem to be adopted on both sides . #% Only within such a positive environment will it be possible to realise this potential and be competitive in the industries of the future , in the agriculture of the future , in the highest standards of healthcare , in our contribution to third world development and the elimination of starvation and disease . #% We had proposed Bronisław Geremek , one of the fathers and architects of today 's Europe of 27 Member States and a symbol of Europe 's reunification . #% Today I also supported amendments which sought to make social and environmental reporting obligatory and supported the kind of reform of the CAP which would `` make poverty history '' . #% I regret that the European left , which gave us the inspirational leadership of Jacques Delors , now seems to lack conviction about the future of our continent . #% That would not benefit any of us and would not benefit fish stocks , which are nearing collapse . #% in writing . - I voted for this report for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the installation , location , operation and identification of the controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors ( codified text ) . #% Mr President , I refer to pages 12 and 13 of the English version of the Minutes and matters that were raised subsequently . #% It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually . #% As a British Member it is with a certain sense of sadness - not anger , not political antagonism - that one hears repeated references to the lack of success of this presidency in leadership of the European Union . #% We need an inclusive society and that means that we have to tackle some of the current heavy regulation . #% In addition to the short-term technical proposals referred in this type of report , the approach of the Commission 's Green Paper , which is both more regional and conservation-orientated , must be embraced . #% There are other immunities which arise in other circumstances where the immunity a Member enjoys is equivalent to that of a Member of a Member State parliament in their own Member State and in other Member States , an immunity from prosecution except with the agreement of Parliament . #% I therefore support the Commission ' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation . #% As Members will notice , the Finnish interpreters do a good job speaking English and other languages because we could not recruit Finnish-speaking English interpreters . #% The triumphalism of the ` no ' voters , however , will be short lived . #% If those countries can bring the same conviction and determination to the solution of the Israeli-Palestine conflict and the same zeal to eliminating their own weapons of mass destruction , as they demand of the Iraqis , then we might make progress . #% We should remind ourselves that those people were in Libya to assist the Libyans ; to provide better healthcare for Libyans . #% There is no intention to change this and the UK industry has no intention of carrying out human reproductive cloning now or in the future . #% What we are accomplishing are secure , minimum safety standards for the design of buses operating in Europe and secure basic requirements to ensure access for disabled people and others with reduced mobility , including older people - Mr Fatuzzo and others no doubt - and parents with children using urban buses . #% The risk of sectoral legislation about one particular kind of fraud is that you simply regulate one part and leave on the margins new forms of fraud , which is unregulated or left under only general criminal law regulation . #% We know this because recently the ruling party actually made some concessions to the opposition to help create free and fair elections . #% Madam President , I simply wish to ask whether we could once again check that the no smoking rules in this House are being enforced . #% In fact , someone diagnosed with lung cancer has an average of between three to ten months of life left . #% It is an honour and a pleasure to have the opportunity to present this report to Parliament today . #% Is there any room for manoeuvre or is that the absolutely determined and settled position of the Commission as you said in your earlier answer ? #% I would like to thank in particular Mr Marín for the work he has done and give thanks for the humanitarian support and for the commitment to logistic support , as we approach a referendum . #% The Commissioner mentioned that he was concerned about birds threatened with extinction . #% in writing . - I voted for this resolution which recalls , in the light of current events in the Southern Mediterranean , particularly in Tunisia and Egypt , the ENP 's failure to promote and safeguard human rights in third countries ; urges the EU to draw lessons from those events and to revise its democracy and human rights support policy so as to create an implementation mechanism for the human rights clause included in all agreements with third countries ; insists that the review of the ENP must prioritise criteria relating to the independence of the judiciary , respect for fundamental freedoms , pluralism and freedom of the press and the fight against corruption ; and calls for better coordination with the Union 's other policies vis-à-vis those countries . #% I take the point made by Mr Huhne and Mr Bolkestein that there are further problems we did not have before . #% in writing . - The Kalniete report rightly emphasises the importance of authorities below the Member State government level in implementing rules relating to the Single Market . #% If we do not reinstate the estimates that the Court of Justice itself made , we will fail more and more often . #% When we make laws here , the Scottish Parliament and government are bound by them and have to put them into effect ; that is quite right and it is the same across other similar regions . #% Unless we are prepared to trust each other ' s judicial systems and democratic practices , however , more and more families will be deprived of their loved ones as innocent people lose their lives to those who murder for political ends . #% I do not know if the Commissioner is familiar with this . #% Any measures should only be taken after impact assessments have shown that the benefits outweigh the costs . #% He is no friend of the Chinese authorities . #% Conversation therapy and other such forms of treatment can only supplement other forms of punishment , such as prison . #% However , I urge the Council and the Commission to press Libya to ratify and implement the Geneva Convention on Refugees of 1951 and its 1967 Protocol , including full cooperation with the UNHCR , so as to guarantee adequate protection and rights for migrants , and adopt asylum legislation that recognises refugees ' status and rights accordingly , notably , the prohibition of collective expulsion and the principle of non-refoulement . #% However , to do so we first must learn the lesson from past failures of the common fisheries policy . #% He also points out that an arithmetical application of the criteria is not possible , and if applied there would not be a sufficient number . #% Especially with a crowded agenda ahead which includes negotiations on the next financial perspectives , talks on Turkish membership and elections in Spain , Britain and Italy . #% Worse than that , I fear it will infringe liberty , and add unnecessary costs to business and consumers without actually making any of our citizens safer . #% So we come to the need for flexibility which other speakers have mentioned . #% Mr President , you did not really answer my question because you said ` verbal ' . #% Mr President , very much in the same tone as Mr Gil-Robles I voted against referral back and for the amendment which , sadly , was rejected . #% We know from surveys that before 1993 compliance with customs controls was costing traders some ECU 7.5 billion every year - that is based on 1992 trade levels but expressed in today 's money . #% History has judged him wrong on the first count but perhaps not on the second . #% 
We need to provide access to capital and training , for small businesses especially , and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , under my rapporteurship , has put budget lines worth a total of ECU 150 million into a package to enable the heads of government to do this . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate Karl von Wogau on his report . #% Mr Napoletano has prepared a report today to the Constitutional Affairs Committee of this Parliament . #% There were no amendments from the committee and I am not quite sure on what grounds the chairman was asking for referral back when he was representing the committee . #% We should never forget what an important sector the construction industry is - 12 million EU citizens are directly employed in the sector and 26 million EU citizens are dependent on it - that is 38 million people reliant on the sector . #% That really is something that needs to be reflected upon . #% Giving blood is a positive act of citizenship . #% Repatriation of refugees is not satisfactory as the people are simply afraid to return to villages devastated , overrun and terrorised by the terrorists or the warlords . #% We have been for a long time hoping that the peace process in the Middle East would come to some form of conclusion . #% President Obasanjo has the potential to be one of the great leaders in the new Africa and should not be tarnished by the behaviour of some of his supporters . #% I wonder whether she can confirm that lack of an internal settlement will not be a barrier to Cyprus 's membership in the next wave and that they will keep to the original timetable ? #% It is important that we learn from previous outbreaks so that we can protect ourselves better in the future . #% If this is so , it was sadly lacking when the Finance Ministers fudged an early warning decision on Germany and Portugal just recently . #% The EU as a whole is a key producer and user of pharmaceutical products and I was happy to support this report . #% A Parliament of this kind and a Union of this kind must have a very particular regard for the interests of minorities and for fairness to minorities and the rights of smaller groups . #% Four million of the poorest people died in one year . #% I support this report because it stresses that the agreement should ensure that increasing bilateral trade brings benefits to the widest number of people and contributes to the Millennium Development Goals , including preventing environmental degradation . #% In the case of the pig sector the export trade is also suffering because during the past two years the pig industry has experienced acute difficulties . #% The EU has broken down barriers across Europe for many years , yet so many infrastructural barriers remain in energy and must be addressed . #% Those on the European side were somewhat handicapped in that they did not have before them the evidence which the Commissioner has just read before this House . #% Developing nations must trade their way out of financial problems . #% No one has been fooled by these deeply flawed elections in Burma ; everyone has welcomed the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest ; but everyone has also condemned the lack of other freedoms that is still imposed . #% I am sure there are many who are greatly disturbed to hear that the Israeli Government has decided to go ahead with the building of the settlement in East Jerusalem . #% However , we should remember that in the EU there are still countries whose female representation in national politics falls short of the mark . #% The President-in-Office did not mention fishing today . #% Renewable energy is the key plank of the solution . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of Amendment 7 . #% The Liberal Democrat approach would be to open the front door a little , by providing legal avenues for immigration , in order better to close the back door to illegal immigration . #% There are many key issues , such as development , which rely upon many voices to get a point of view across . #% While I am sympathetic to patient groups , many of the patient groups have come to me and said they were misrepresented . #% However , the seriousness of this issue comes back to the fore when we realise that the floor leader of the Grand National Party in Korea said just recently that this de facto moratorium on capital punishment should be ended and a swift execution should take place of certain prisoners . #% Many of the amendments had much to commend them but they would have threatened the directive as a whole - as so often in politics the best would have been the enemy of the good . #% I find this behaviour extraordinary . #% The only way that we can make progress in fighting climate change is responsible reports such as this one which hold those accountable who cause the most pollution and which is why I was able to support it . #% The European Commission and we in the Parliament , too , should do all in our power to ensure that consumers Europe-wide can have confidence in their food purchases . #% Mr President , as a member of the Convention I noticed that very early on it became a commonplace - at least certain governments tried to make it so - that the six-monthly rotation of the presidency of the Council leads to inefficiency , a loss of momentum , a loss of direction and , sotto voce , that if too many small countries have the presidency it will not work . #% in writing . - I voted for this report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on rear-mounted roll-over protection structures of narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors ( codified text ) . #% If you look round you will see that there are only two or three Members present , four including yourself . #% We should not apply stricter standards than for previous enlargements , nor pretend that everything in our own gardens smells sweet . #% The broad brush approach , I would contend , has not worked with stocks on the decline and recovery very slow , if evident at all . #% When we act fast we find that we need urgency and urgency frequently leads to bad law . #% These measures represent a major step forward towards the creation of a European judicial space . #% It is now up to the Council and our Member States to put democracy , human dignity and the rule of law back at the centre of proceedings and work to foster peace in the region . #% Is there going to be any attempt to recover the money by way of compensation ? #% And then I see that all this great work which is to take place from 1998 to the year 2000 is going to cost ECU 30m . #% I thank the President-in-Office , Mr Mitchell , for a very full reply . #% The response of the EU to this , and to the resulting deterioration within Togo itself , is in marked contrast to the inspirational response of this House and our European Union to the situation in Ukraine . #% The report promotes the following : a global fund financed by G8 , the EU , oil-rich nations and others to finance access to and supply of medication and treatment ; a global strategy to implement a programme of action to treat and prevent communicable diseases ; tiered pricing of medicines from the pharmaceutical industry to ensure wide access to treatment ; support for health infrastructure to scan , diagnose , treat and monitor patients , as supply of medicines in itself is inadequate ; use of incentives - both financial and legislative - to enhance research and development to produce new medicines and vaccines by both industry and the public sector ; the European Commission to work closely with the governments of developing countries , UN agencies , NGOs and civil society to implement the programme . #% Joining forces to innovate so as to solve common problems in Europe means more focus , more rapid development , efficiency , including cost-efficiency , and greater creativity . #% In these circumstances we should welcome the chance to bring in an effective regulation on e-commerce . #% I hope that the threat of those safeguards will be sufficient to ensure that they are not used . #% When I returned to Brussels , there was no sign of this letter . #% I hope you have had a good dinner . #% Stand by universality and affordability ! #% As there are a number of difficult situations building up in various African states I hope the Commission will use Article 366a in its widest form . #% We believe that the Bureau is taking decisions which could have a knock-on effect in the future because a precedent is being created . #% I personally always have difficulty when it comes to restricting the rights of the individual . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the compromise package on tyre labelling . #% My group had sought a motion on Hong Kong in view of the recent statements there by the government of the territory , which suggest that there is not to be any movement towards universal suffrage . #% I am also astonished that European parliamentarians and journalists were refused access to Western Sahara and call on the Moroccan authorities to allow the press and non-governmental organisations access to the region . #% In particular , I support the main objectives with the aim of encouraging the transfer of traffic from road to rail . #% I would like to know what I am going to say to the likes of John Campbell of Glenrath Farms and all the producers in the United Kingdom who have spent , on average , GBP 2 million each to comply with the legislation and now incur an extra cost that is between 8 and 10 % higher than under a conventional cage system . #% It is wasting the Commission 's time and it is wasting our time . #% We look to the Commission to keep a beady eye on the progress that is being made . #% The work that is being done on capital markets is most important . #% It defines for the first time in international law a terrorist act and the offences which constitute a terrorist act . #% 
But sometimes it can produce ridiculous results , for example when environmental laws are too detailed to allow sensible local discretion in adapting common principles to local situations . #% Madam President , I know how hard it is to chair these sessions , but I wonder what relevance that supplementary had to Mr Mitchell 's original question ? #% Mr Wijsenbeek 's report looks especially at the financing of public transport and promoting intermodality . #% It would appear , to my group at least , that according to that definition this is a very good compromise . #% There is almost total opposition to these proposals in Scotland and yet the United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency just yesterday gave its approval for these potentially disastrous plans to go forward . #% The Commission proposal will help people to stop smoking . #% That delay was intended to allow time for the other institutions to consider our amendments and for the Commission to formulate amended proposals . #% Under Article 90 of the Rules of Procedure of this House , the Commission is duty bound to consult with us on international agreements . #% I find it difficult to understand or justify why services were left out of that enterprise . #% Firstly , as the Commissioner has said , the 75 tariff lines that would help boost Pakistan 's trade by an estimated EUR 100 million a year do little harm to EU investment . #% As has been said in the course of the debate , there is a matter of serious concern about the future pension liabilities of all the Member States . #% The motion for resolution which was adopted shows acceptance that the question is not if Turkey will join but when and under what conditions . #% He has again shown he is a good friend of the King of Morocco and , unfortunately , an apologist for the illegal occupation of the Western Sahara by Morocco . #% I do not know if you know , but Parliament voted in February to delete the reference to age limits from the Annex to the Staff Regulations . #% On the question of consultation : we have been consulted at every opportunity . #% If he appeals , the Lord Advocate of Scotland will have to contend in our highest appeal court for the lawfulness of a defence policy based on weapons of mass destruction . #% The UK 's designated port scheme may have been well-intentioned but it has not been helpful to those ports which have not been designated but which do , in fact , have fish processing activity , which is important to these communities . #% In particular , in light of the country 's candidacy for EU membership , respecting human rights , including women 's rights must be made a priority . #% There must be a balance , however , so that any new directive that is passed is not unnecessarily obstructive to farmers and agricultural business . #% The amendment also ignores the political realities of other Member States : it is ridiculous that this House can not fully cooperate with the Scottish Parliament on matters such as fisheries , where Scotland holds the biggest UK stake . #% Additionality , whether or not EU funds are providing additional impact , compared to what would otherwise have happened , can be used as one of the selection criteria by the local programme planners before they decide to approve aid to individual projects . #% I wish to support all the amendments on the ramp and the pigs , because I have watched the horror of trying to get pigs into a lorry . #% We should waste no time in deploying the 7000 troops that the Union has pledged to UNIFIL to stabilise the situation in southern Lebanon , to cut off the flow of arms and to support the humanitarian effort . #% That is its value . #% The accepted guidelines are designed to prevent the acute and long-term effects to the eyes and skin that can occur with high levels of exposure . #% Those who urge America not to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iraq are not appeasers , as Donald Rumsfeld implies when he compares George W. Bush to Winston Churchill . #% The truth is that picture of the family is a declining picture of the family . #% It is in the frontline of the war against terrorism , costing it so far , it is reckoned , USD 40 billion . #% In the new Rule 36 , we must ` fully respect ' those rights as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% This will enable Parliament to give its response in time for the Council to discuss it . #% We want a political settlement in Iraq that guarantees the highest standards of civil and political rights for all Iraqis . #% Mr President , on the same issue , the Socialist Group supports the other groups in demanding a statement from Commissioner Brittan . #% I hope that in the future more women will be able to make informed choices and they will not have to suffer in the way that so many women like Margot have in the past . #% Mr President , I shall start by also congratulating Mrs Stihler on her excellent report and on the excellent speech she made this evening in this House . #% Why should every Member not have a screen on their desks to bring us into the 21st century ? #% I strongly support the direction in which we are going and hope we manage to get home to port at the next plenary . #% However , if local authorities , in their wisdom , feel they can do better for their citizens , they can so do without having to notify the Commission , as long as they keep within the rules , which ensure that potential competitors are not harmed and , most specifically , that they are small in scale and very local in nature . #% However , whistle-blowing has a different ramification in the west of Scotland : it tends to indicates flutes and that does not go down too well in my part of the world . #% To this end , language training should be provided by the Member State to long-term residents . #% I would also support the call for Member States to urgently ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings . #% Whilst I therefore supported amendments to increase preferential access to the EU market for those third countries which have ratified and appropriately applied core international labour and environmental standards as an added incentive , I believe that the Commission should work more closely with the ILO to investigate and inform itself of the observance and enforcement of these core standards in practice , so as to safeguard against future abuses of the new GSP + system . #% For all these reasons we should support this programme . #% The codes of transparency and democracy which drove the Constitutional Convention were a good deal preferable to secretive summits , and backroom deals in the wee small hours of Thursday morning . #% I challenge your presidency to stand up for our Union 's values by speaking for Europe as a whole at the EU-US summit on the issue of the remaining Guantanamo Bay detainees . #% We must do all that we can to bring this to an end . #% Help has to be given to rebuild not just their physical requirements but also their institutional organizations to give them the ability to run their countries . #% Could you give me an explanation , that I can pass on , as to why the mini-session has been changed ? #% I ask , in the mean time , that Parliament concentrate on this paragraph 3 and the parallel amendments tabled by myself and colleagues . #% We ask the appropriate bodies in this House to look again at the way in which we organise our work . #% We have to show our citizens that the European Union can work on energy policy , on issues like mobile phone roaming charges , and in particular on justice and home affairs . #% I am particularly concerned that the Internet is being abused by both pornographers and paedophiles . #% The third amendment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy concerns the computerised monitoring system . #% Finally , the 60 % compensation scheme is equivalent to full compensation and the Commissioner should keep reiterating that . #% Croatia can not duck that issue . #% Moreover , on Bulgaria and Romania , a clear difference is emerging . #% Hopefully Parliament , together with the Commission and the Council , can help to bring it back on track . #% They are in Parliament today and tomorrow to raise awareness of the former Soviet empire 's nuclear testing programme which impacted not just severely but hugely on their country . #% Fortunately , and I disagree with the last speaker , the Gemelli report strengthens the Commission proposals . #% Enlargement is a process of continuous assessment , not a one-off exam . #% Let us not be satisfied with woolly wording in relation to vital public service . #% The question of the strength of the media within Hungary is very important . #% Will the Commission tonight promise a full inquiry into the causes of the Channel Tunnel fire and eliminate any potential cause which may be linked to the blockade . #% The demographic trends are such that there are fewer people in the younger age range and more in the older age range and we must look at these changes . #% In my report , I broadly welcome the Commission proposals for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism and for a European arrest warrant . #% But in the face of the recurring violence , we have recycled those tired phrases so often that they have lost whatever impact they once had . #% I welcome this opportunity to support the idea of national action plans as a way of implementing the Lisbon Strategy , with every government nominating a minister to coordinate action . #% 
Perhaps the Commissioner could see fit to promote the greater use of cycle paths throughout the European Union and easier access for bicycles to be carried on trains . #% I gather that the decision has been taken without consultation of the Bureau of the Israeli delegation or with any members of the delegation . #% In particular , the report highlights the lack of progress in the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets and urges action in the opening up of European markets in energy , transport and postal services . #% Paragraph 5 of the report requests an increase of the 5 % fin - to live-weight ratio to 6.5 % , particularly for blue sharks . #% From a Scottish perspective , we have a particular stake in the energy debate given our massive energy resources and even greater energy potential . #% I think it would need a miracle by the Archangel Gabriel to persuade Mr Cassidy to come round to our position . #% The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories must be addressed urgently . #% Given recent events in Libya , it is crucial that we continue to campaign for and seek to defend human rights at an international level . #% In particular I want to deplore the role of the British Government in this . #% To address the democratic deficit , it needs greater democratic accountability . #% However , given that this is the last month that this will take place , can you give me and this House an assurance that any changes which are to take place regarding Members ' interests will be put to the Members of this House the way the change in the Members ' voting procedure should have been put to this House in January ? #% This European initiative is to be welcomed as a means of better coordinating the EU 's work against dementia . #% We also visited the Department of Forestry in Malaysia and were rather impressed by environmental concerns there . #% Taking individual examples , the UK will be required to scrap 23.1 % , Belgium 25.3 % , Denmark 27.3 % and Sweden will face a staggering loss of 49.7 % of her gross tonnage . #% So I would be a bit worried about sending him to Spain . #% The overall thrust is quite correct . #% My Group can not accept a lack of clarity on this point . #% I wish to put on record that many of us in this House find it unacceptable that the Commission refuses to accept , for technical reasons , an amendment which is a clear expression of the political will of Parliament . #% Madam President , I refer to page 16 of the English version of the Minutes concerning the vote on my report yesterday . #% The insights they provided allowed me to make specific input to the report . #% We have to work towards availability of supply , but balance this with high hygiene levels and sustainability of that supply . #% Along with my shadow rapporteurs , I have modified the sections of the report which are no longer relevant or which were so unclear that no one was able to follow them or ensure their application . #% Member States must face up to their responsibilities and we in Parliament must play our part by ensuring that sufficient resources are voted into inspection and surveillance . #% However , support for initiatives in , for example , the fields of vessel safety , fuel economy , training and investment funding is worth pursuing at local and EU level , through the European Fisheries Fund . #% in writing . - I voted for this report which recognises the major role of statistics in the development of more effective tourism policies at European , national , regional and local levels . #% Yes , we need to examine other tools such as risk insurance and future markets . #% The Commission ' s scheme to compensate food processors for losing out on export refunds , by encouraging them to seek inward processing relief on a range of commodities from outside the EU , is both muddle-headed and inept . #% I thank my colleagues for the work they have put into it and recommend that they adopt the report as it stands , and vote against the 30 amendments which have been submitted , which seem to me to relate to issues that have already been dealt with in committee . #% The Commissioners have gone . #% I would urge the Bulgarian Government to address those issues within the next year so that they can become members in 2007 . #% I am also glad that the Knesset has approved the Wye Accord and that we can move forward hopefully to see some greater security within that agreement . #% Germany - the best citizen , perhaps , of our Community - wants deeper and wider ; the UK , perhaps the worst Member State , wants wider but not deeper ; France wants deeper but not wider . #% It was about gradual liberalisation ; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price ; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector . #% The European Union must continue to play a crucial role in the search for peace in the Middle East . #% Financial services make a very substantial contribution to the economy of Scotland , and re-insurance , whether directly or indirectly , affect Scottish-based enterprises and consumers . #% Of course , it is important that we should check that there is an adequate legal base . #% They would be unlikely to get someone else who had simply been handed a dossier , who was unacquainted with its contents and would just give a completely unsatisfactory off-the-cuff answer . #% In fact , I understand that the Council Secretariat is preparing a letter saying , ` please , if things do n't get better soon , we may have to ask you to stop helping us ! ' #% This IGC was not fated to fail it chose to . #% I hear that the draft is currently running to two pages . #% I know that in the past the Commission has taken action on products that have come from East Jerusalem , the Golan Heights , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . #% Why should the European Parliament not meet formally every week to receive a report from the Commission ? #% The other was the question of the 600 to 5 000 tonne tankers which we were concerned would not be available . #% There should be public discussion too of the Union 's burgeoning defence policy , currently being planned behind closed doors . #% The EU will increasingly receive foreign investment and we can not push investor protection to the detriment of the general interest . #% Will anybody take a bet with me that we will be here again in six months ' time ? #% This is not cap in hand . #% Mr President , the Musotto report is a good report . #% ` Difficult ' indeed , Sir . #% This is the only logical and realistic approach to achieving a sustainable deepwater fishery . #% As my friend Mr Lannoye said , it is , if not ` too little , too late ' , at any rate ` not very much and rather late ' . #% I speak in this House for the European Free Alliance , for the parties representing minority nations within Member States -- regions , as they are sometimes called : not very accurately , in my judgment . #% This is a coup in every sense of the word and we should show no sympathy for it . #% We need , as a Parliament , to resolve more issues in committee and reform both the structure of our debates and the way we vote . #% But there are estimates that far more than 40 000 jobs may be lost , and this at a time of enormously high unemployment . #% I would like clarification as to which coherent and transparent financial instrument will be used for the return policy in question and readmission agreements in particular . #% Despite my complimentary remarks , I am not too happy with some of the wording in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the motion for a resolution , where phrases like ` the ACP partners must be made to understand ' what the European views are on democracy . #% Therefore , in welcoming and supporting this resolution , my Group would also sound a note of caution that the people on the ground trying to help those most affected by the situation must not have their freedom of movement curtailed by our actions . #% Europeans deserve better . #% If we allow the Member States simply to appoint anyone to take the role of observer - and we do have rumours that some Member States want to appoint national parliamentarians - I think that would be entirely unacceptable . #% However , the failure of our approach to date is written in spilled blood on the ground . #% I too share my Irish colleagues ' concerns that , as Mr Ó Neachtain stated in the Irish Examiner , we could find these waters completely fished-out in no time at all . #% in writing . - I supported this resolution as I believe the specific issue of safeguarding equal treatment and fair competition on public procurement markets in the EU and in third countries urgently needs more political attention . #% It is the most reliable method for ensuring that tuna is dolphin safe . #% The test , though , is not whether , from time to time you get things wrong but whether or not you learn from your mistakes . #% Therefore , I would ask the Commission this afternoon to clarify a number of issues . #% 
Mr President , given the tragic nature of the disaster off the coast of Galicia and the other Member States which have since been affected by the oil tragedy , there is great solidarity and support in this House for our colleagues in Galicia . #% That affects not just people in Scotland ; it even more affects people down the motorway routes through England , if far too much heavy freight traffic goes down there . #% The conference came up with some recommendations which we have put to the Commission . #% Can I say that this report has been under negotiation for nine years and it is only now coming to fruition . #% Mr President , we are well aware in this House that many thousands of fishermen , processors and ancillary workers have suffered severe hardship as a result of the cod recovery proposals agreed by the Council last December . #% Amendment No 4 by Mr Provan is very dangerous , as was an answer he gave in a press conference today . #% Mobile phones should be included , unlike what the previous speaker said . #% I do not know the difference between the regions of Luxembourg intimately , but I dare say they are less than the difference between the regions of Scotland . #% The amendments proposed in the committee 's report recognise that management action , rather than drastic fleet cuts , is more appropriate for this stock . #% Therefore we have the legal means to protect not only increasingly pressurised sport professionals , but also the countless minors and amateurs vulnerable to doping in sport . #% I suspect this is a breach of the rules of the interinstitutional agreement . #% Going forward as well , we also need to see a greater degree of understanding , a greater degree of flexibility . #% Sanctions should be used sparingly and only as a last resort , but we in this House should not be afraid to call for them and indeed to see them implemented , as they are the only real weapon for encouraging internal change within that country . #% It supports the work of the Competitiveness Council . #% I welcome Mr Kindermann highlighting this . #% My understanding is that there are some technical difficulties on compensation to the Italian fishing fleet which is a separate issue between the Italian Government and the European Commission . #% To provide the security , prosperity and opportunity which our fellow citizens expect government to deliver , we have to work together . #% I welcome this report , which outlines the preventive steps that should be taken in health and veterinary care to protect workers from injuries caused by needles and other medical sharps . #% By that time we had contacted groups throughout Europe and brought the issue to the Petitions Committee in 1998 , though looking around this room and I do not see anybody who was at that Committee . #% Unable to admit that national sovereignty is a luxury of the past , they persist in trying to impose their order on others . #% The Conference of Presidents last week agreed on only two subjects for debate in our regular ` urgencies ' slot on Thursday ; normally we debate three . #% We seek to improve access to legal assistance for those seeking asylum and to emphasise that asylum seekers should not be sent back to places where their lives might be in danger . #% This means that richer players , such as the EU , should complete the necessary reforms to end distorting subsidies in agriculture and open our agricultural markets to products from poorer , agriculture-dependent countries . #% The close scrutiny of commissioners , veterinary officers , scientists , ministry officials and many others who gave evidence has quite clearly shown that in the early days of this dreadful BSE epidemic there were mistakes at all levels , both at Commission and European level . #% It should also serve to bolster the Commission 's new-found courage as regards biotechnology and the life sciences . #% This a very unsatisfactory way of doing business . #% That is the sort of inflationary , inflammatory type of remark which is creating the problem and making it even worse . #% So getting aid to those most in need is absolutely vital and that requires local knowledge and the right kind of aid . #% Mr President , let me do a rather unusual thing in the European Parliament and respond to the previous four speakers , not a thing that people often do . #% In common with most other colleagues who have spoken in the debate , I think this directive is going in the right direction and that we should all be pushing it as well as we can towards a conclusion . #% Across the North Sea , in a country of similar size , the Scottish Government is making a vital contribution to climate change efforts . #% We look forward to seeing what will come out of the employment guidelines which the Commission agreed at the conference in Luxembourg and some of the discussions about the European Social Fund and older workers . #% Mr Martin said that the roll-call votes on Friday did not count and you also have made a distinction . #% On the substance , Aid for Trade is a vital tool for linking developing countries to the global economy . #% The European Union must step up its support for financial reform of the Authority to help it distance itself from terrorism . #% While quacks of State must each produce his plan , #% I believe that the legal systems of all the EU Member States have the capacity to guarantee justice . #% Mr President , I am grateful for this opportunity to make some general comments about the 2001 Budget . #% As Mr Gil-Robles has said , and as I said earlier , we are now in a position where the interinstitutional agreement as regards OLAF applies to the Commission , to the Council and to the staff of this institution but it does not apply to the Members of this institution . #% This could take up to three months . #% What about the fine that the Commission imposed on the Italian organisers of the World Cup in 1990 , a fine which was , in fact , larger than the fine that is imposed on the CFO this year ? #% I would like to thank Members of this House , in particular former colleague Karel de Gucht , Gijs de Vries and now Mr Anastassopoulos , for their work to see that such injustice is repaired . #% in writing . - I welcome the push for democracy in Libya and in neighbouring countries . #% I hope that you will continue to seek to balance repressive measures against illegal immigration with a generous approach to refugees and an emphasis on human rights and fundamental freedoms . #% The Commissioner will doubtless largely agree with us . #% Therefore it is excellent to discover , as Mr Koukiadis shows , that it is a matter for the Community Pillar . #% We have a number of objections to the Constitution itself , but in the seconds remaining I will simply mention the inadequate subsidiarity provisions . #% It should be slightly smaller but it would just have been gesture politics to retable the amendment we put in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market since it was obviously not going to be carried . #% I also voted against increases in budget lines relating to expenses , travel and administrative costs . #% The proposal to extend Regulation 117/70 deserves Parliament 's support since it is just this type of aid to combined transport which we believe is in line with the European Union 's future transport policy . #% I would ask you to confirm that this has indeed been carried out . #% Fortunately the risk to most of these air passengers from transport accidents is extremely low and I certainly took great comfort from the impressive statistics which the rapporteur produced to prove that . #% Tartan Day is a day of celebration where Scotland reaches out to our diaspora in North America and encourages our North American friends to come and visit us . #% As the European Blood Alliance outline , voluntary and non-remunerated donations of blood and blood components are considered to be a gift from healthy citizens to those in need . #% Liberals and Democrats are disappointed - though not surprised - by what has come to pass . #% The employee will be guaranteed reasonable hours over the whole of the year . #% If the Doha Round is successfully concluded , the conditional agreement on the definitive elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies by 2013 would translate into incremental yearly EC budget savings that are estimated to be around EUR 3 500-4 000 million per year , depending on internal and world market prices , as of 2013 . #% These two policy areas are linked . #% Madam President , much has been said tonight , and it is difficult to add anything refreshingly new . #% I welcome it because my friend , Mrs Müller , who is the scourge of the Commission , tells me that this is a fairly well run programme and that Mrs Cresson 's dentist does not have any part in it . #% For Liberals and Democrats it beggars belief that a British Prime Minister is depriving UK citizens of the rights which made his country respected - and which are now guaranteed to other citizens - in order to pander to the popular press . #% Mr President , this has been a good debate and it is important for certain Member States . #% Secondly , we would like an assurance that the Bureau will not wait three months to review these matters but will review them within the next three days . #% Therefore , I would urge the House to support the switching of EUR 30 million . #% The report suggests ways of dealing with each of these problems . #% In the area of forced sales , we support the idea of a scoreboard , comparing the length and costs of judicial processes in the various Member States . #% 
I am sorry because I had hoped to raise a point about the agenda , which we have now adopted . #% I respectfully disagree with Mr Rothley on the issue of privileges and immunities . #% I look forward to receiving the report the Commissioner talked about on the development of our forestries . #% We must make sure that we never have systems of research support that are so over-burdened with bureaucracy , with application mechanisms so difficult to penetrate that we use resources in applying for research funds that should be spent doing the research itself . #% Madam President , I should like to congratulate the Council and the Commission on the progress made at Tampere in so many areas and I would like to associate myself with the remarks made earlier by my Liberal Democrat colleague Baroness Ludford . #% It will drown the hopes of democracy in the Middle East . #% We know that some of our stocks are at seriously low levels , and therefore when there is a ban on cod fishing , it is not just the fishermen , but the processors that lose out too . #% Let us be openly critical of the British failure to act as the President of Europe rather than the fifty-second state of the US . #% That is to be greatly welcomed by this House and a great step forward . #% However , since issues such as people trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children have such an international dimension , EU-level action may be appropriate . #% This means wholesale debt relief and scaled-up , better coordinated and better targeted aid . #% in writing . - I voted in favour on the Weisgerber report . #% He has closed eight television and radio stations and has made sure that every other voice of opposition is oppressed . #% If we are to fulfil our objective of staying within the financial perspectives , enlargement must also mean reform of the common agricultural policy . #% He may remember a constituent of mine , Simon Hossack , who wrote many letters to the Commission and I tabled many questions on his behalf . #% Mr Rajamäki , you said that human rights are at the top of the Council 's concerns and fully taken into account . #% I am very concerned that Commissioner Fischler should have been here at 6.40 p.m. to take the questions . #% These labels have , until now , been unregulated , confusing and often misleading . #% However , I want you to focus on an African woman who is suffering and dying from HIV/AIDS , TB or malaria . #% What about the CIA secret prisons saga , where this House was right to set up a committee on rendition to see whether we need to use Article 7 ? #% My group also agrees that Member States have to work together better to tackle terrorism , but we remain suspicious of the Council 's intent to employ biometric identifiers widely . #% One can not say that about the rest of Europe , and it is the lack of confidence that has created the problems . #% I urge you to check and verify the information you have been given because I am told there will be no direct flight to London this week . #% The Poignant and Gallagher reports have attracted some amendments , which seek to do away with the 6/12 mile limits and break open the Shetland Box and gain free access to the North Sea . #% It is right that legal protection is extended beyond the labour market and this proposed Directive will be a valuable tool in the fight against intolerance . #% Some animal welfare groups launch campaigns to terrorise those connected , sometimes only tenuously , to experiments on live animals . #% We in the European Free Alliance hope that the process which we start today will be marked by a respect for subsidiarity in a generous and extensive sense : Amendments No 5 and 18 from the Liberals and Amendment 28 from my own group are for us keystones of this process . #% It is of equal importance that the welfare and mobility rights of circus workers are protected through the use of short-term residence permits . #% Some of these proposals are premature and some are unlikely ever to be desirable ; for this reason , the Labour Members decided to abstain on this text . #% It is a monstrous stability under which nobody seeks justice in law courts , which flaunt their subservience and partisanship , nobody in his or her right mind seeks protection from the institutions entrusted with maintaining law and order because they are totally corrupt . #% It was like a dialogue of the deaf last night . #% Transparency in expenses is essential . #% My own ancestral languages in Scotland - Gaelic and Lowland Scots - have suffered severe discrimination and neglect over a couple of centuries . #% It is a very successful method . #% That is quite an achievement , given that it is only a consultation exercise . #% If they did not know much about GMOs before 3.45 p.m. they certainly know much more about them now . #% Mr President , if this is a sign of things to come from the influence of the events in Berlin on this House , then they will do us no good whatsoever . #% Mr President , it is said that a bad compromise leaves some people happy and some people sad , while a good compromise leaves everybody pretty well unsatisfied . #% We welcome Mr Fischler 's generous offer to meet with leaders of the industry to discuss alternatives to the draconian proposals which have been widely publicised by the Fisheries DG in the last few days . #% Mr President-in-Office , most of us can admire the tactics and future tasks to be conducted by Europol as an organisation . #% Indeed , satellite-based studies by the German Aerospace Centre have shown us that , using less than 0.3 % of the desert area of the Middle East and North Africa , enough high-voltage electricity can be generated to supply current and future demand in Europe , the Middle East and North Africa . #% Nevertheless , when this was fully discussed in committee , we had to accept the very strong legal view of the Commission that this would not be possible . #% After yesterday 's adoption of taxation at Community level , a salary at 50 % of a European Court Judge 's , an implementation date after 2004 and immunities which would involve primary legislation , we believe this has gone too far . #% On the same issue , it is not just in getting the honourable Member 's name wrong that the administration have boobed , in actual fact the question of restraint of trade is a question for Mr Monti because he is the one who has put the paper before the Commission and he is down for questions , so I do not see why it was tabled in the wrong section . #% It is a disgrace and we should say so ! #% The interpretation of the Sixth Directive by Member States , often to the benefit of their national treasuries , is no less than scandalous . #% The European Parliament reached , after great length , an acceptable compromise . #% Mr President , I rise on the same point which has just been made . #% Are we not , as the only elected representatives of the people of these Member States , expected to safeguard the interests of the people who live in the Member States ? #% However , what concerns me about this agreement is that it is the first in what will be a series of such agreements . #% Women in the EU diagnosed with breast cancer need to understand the treatment options available to them . #% National parliaments do not need a European Constitution to scrutinise the European work of their ministers more closely , but they need to be engaged in a process of monitoring and holding ministers to account . #% Where peace is achieved , help must be given for demobilisation and reintegration , and the use of child soldiers below the age of 18 must be banned . #% In conclusion , I welcome the Wijsenbeek and Killilea reports . #% I would like to congratulate Ireland on having become the tiger economy of Europe and of being able to qualify . #% Also , greater access to long-term financing and availability of risk capital will be hugely beneficial . #% I look forward to us joining you in cyberspace , if not geographically . #% The reality is that there are large numbers of Turks living in Germany and France , large numbers of Muslims - including Turkish Cypriots - who live in Britain . #% I strongly support multilateral aid backed up by bilateral aid where it can complement a project . #% This report emphasises , therefore , a number of key concerns : there should be no broad-brush approach ; there must be accurate scientific advice , the impact of industrial fisheries must be recognised ; there must be adequate funding ; and accessible diversification programmes should be available . #% I welcome the underlying Commission communication , but I would say , on behalf of my Group , that we regret that this communication was not much stronger . #% As Members of this Parliament , we believe this is undemocratic . #% In the service of the Lisbon Agenda your Commission has been an engine of intelligent , inventive , reformist single market legislation . #% This country 's continued participation in the European Neighbourhood Policy must be made conditional on democratic reforms rather than on its willingness to supply oil for the Nabucco pipeline . #% Share fishermen jointly own their vessels and are paid solely by share of their catches . #% For all bus and coach journeys of 250 km or more , there will be specific assistance , free of charge , for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility , both at terminals and on board and , where necessary , transport free of charge for accompanying persons . #% 
The problems of getting home from Strasbourg are just as bad and colleagues have had to leave here at lunchtime today so that they can be home for tomorrow morning . #% They are able to say ` we are against patenting the human body ' , but then they are making it legal to give a patent on an isolated gene on a gene sequence . #% Will the Council take advantage of this new climate to up the tempo of meetings of the Quartet and the road map to peace in the Middle East , in order to lend greater impetus to that process ? #% I quote from the Commission 's own document which says : `` The Scientific , Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries found no evidence that stocks had , in general , deteriorated or improved since the adoption of MAGP4 . '' #% Recently I went to the European Youth Opera in Baden Baden to see that launched and it is a great success . #% It is therefore preferable at that stage to get all calves into groups as soon as possible . #% I also believe that Mr Sharif should be allowed to return to the country and campaign if he so wishes , and again have his security guaranteed . #% If we could summon the drive and the determination , the guts and the grit , we could make the shift from oil while providing jobs , drinking water and better infrastructure for those bearing the brunt of climate change . #% I hope this resolution will give an added impetus to the Union 's dealings with this troubled region and the positive experience that we can bring to its future . #% Many of the problems that affect injured parties in trade disputes , especially SMEs with limited resources , arise from the time it takes for the WTO to make its rulings - often many months , if not years . #% The Committee on International Trade fully supports the Commission 's efforts to improve policy coherence between the Community 's external and internal policies . #% It is worth reminding ourselves of the 13 long years this process has taken as the siren voices of the sceptics seek to dash enlargement on the rocks . #% Indeed when I was at school we were told that the United Kingdom was a lump of coal surrounded by a teeming sea of fish . #% We in our group believe much in extended subsidiarity . #% It is not true to say that Ethiopia has not been crying for help for food aid over the past two years , but the war situation has blurred the vision of many looking on . #% The forthcoming summit in Stockholm will discuss a range of issues important to the EU , Russia and , indeed , the wider global community , and Parliament has today sent a united message highlighting the areas of key interest and concern . #% It is not just a recent phenomenon ; we have been requesting the study for some years now . #% It would be an irony if the working time directive was imposed upon fishermen who do not need or want it but fails to benefit oil workers who do . #% Mr President , I would like to ask the movers of Amendments Nos 31 and 37 to clarify whether they intend that this should ban the therapeutic cloning of human embryos . #% It is really for them to look after Members ' interests . #% I have always maintained , in previous points of order when this first came up , that if it was a change of Rules - and it must be a Rule if it has political ramifications which cash-for-votes certainly has - it has to go to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities and then be discussed by this House . #% If so , that is a debate we welcome , but surely a debate which would better have been conducted some months ago . #% Mr President , it is just very specifically on what you have said , because you are the second Vice-President this morning who has referred to the different system . #% I suggest that he look at the Hunterston nuclear power station where a reactor had to be shut down in March of this year . #% Of course it would be good practice if Parliament - and by that I assume the Committee on Development and Cooperation - could be consulted before suspension took place . #% On the separate issue over transparency concerning who serves on technical bodies and how they work , I think that we have moved the bodies which approve products further than was originally foreseen . #% The market in fireworks is characterised by problems relating to the quality of imported products , their safe handling , safe storage and their condition of manufacture . #% It is established practice that we use the geographic names of counterparts . #% Statistical effect is of crucial importance to regions across Europe . #% I urge the House to recommend to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure that an overall majority is needed to change the responsibilities of committees . #% From 1991 to 1997 , UN inspectors - UNSCOM - systematically and comprehensively inspected , destroyed and verified Iraq 's capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction . #% Our group will only grant these powers if they are time limited and they are constrained to extreme circumstances . #% I support the rapporteur in stressing that the same rules must be applied to imported beef from non-EU countries and , in cases where not all information is available , a clear indication to that effect should be provided . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs voted for it clearly and my own group has tabled some amendments . #% Instead , we have to look for the best practice and best policy to deal with issues which may impact upon the way in which people want to live their lives , bring up children and live together , which varies considerably across the Member States . #% However , it should not come at the expense of securing a successful Doha round before Mr Bush 's mandate expires on 1 July . #% Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter ? #% There seemed to be no unanimity within Israel or within the PLO , and the Palestinian cause generally , as to how to proceed . #% You tried hard to strike the deals Europe needs . #% I heard the Commissioner with some interest . #% It may not always be appropriate simply to transpose controls which are designed for farmed animals to fishing and aquaculture products . #% For a quarter of a century this Chamber has gathered powers and asked European citizens for respect , for trust . #% Such behaviour will no longer be tolerated . #% The EU and the US offer substantial subsidies to their farmers . #% Any steps that can be taken to improve these connections are greatly to be welcomed and much to be encouraged . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity this evening to debate the violation of women 's rights in EU international relations . #% Such conditions exist in Djibouti today that we really have to look at our policy because it is part of Lomé , it receives aid from the EU and one of our Member States , France , is very strategically placed and has considerable influence in Djibouti . #% The situation in Chechnya can be ameliorated by EU involvement , and this motion contains ideas which we must ensure are taken forward . #% Contrary to inaccurate Eurosceptic scare-stories that have caused much controversy amongst consumers , British consumer choice is protected . #% This matter has been drawn to the attention of the Committee on Citizens ' Rights and Freedoms , Justice and Home Affairs , which I have the honour to chair . #% We can not afford to stifle vital European SMEs . #% Much praise is due to Mr Rocard for this superb and detailed report . #% It did not apply to the right to strike , the right of association and it did not apply to pay or to lock-outs . #% The EUR 0.45 million will be used to retrain and support workers through a difficult transition . #% Yet as my colleague here said , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is going to spend our money on two other reactors as a price for the agreement of closure . #% Your programme 's proposals on transatlantic relations , which are on the mend after the breakdown caused by the crisis over Iraq , and your aim to rebuild ties with America are welcome . #% Madam President , I hope you will not penalise my speaking time if I add my protest to that of Mr Varela . #% It contains a welter of information and worthy aims , but without more overt economic pressure from us , I fear that it will remain a shopping list never to be fulfilled . #% The Spanish Government must do all it can to bring justice to those people affected . #% in writing . - Given the scientific uncertainty and ethical questions involved , I fully support calls for the Commission to bring forward proposals seeking to prohibit the cloning of animals for food supplies . #% That is why I voted against this report . #% But , more importantly , it is helping to fund other forms of criminal activity and strengthening international organised crime . #% With regard to the stability pact , I have a question for the Commission . #% As the defenders of the Community method , the strength of our House is ultimately the strength of yours . #% It is important that these efforts are redoubled in order to counter the rise in Islamophobia , Anti-Semitism and discrimination against other minority groups , especially those from new Member States . #% We must enforce our own policy not just against the Myanmar Oil and Gas Company , but also against the Myanmar Timber Company and Myanmar Post and Telecoms , and I regret that they do not appear in this resolution . #% 
I am sure the Commissioner is aware that the trade itself is not particularly comfortable with the idea of developing such an agency . #% The main protagonists in that battle royal happen to be the current President of the Commission and the current President of the Council . #% You might talk to Colin Powell tomorrow about threatening suspension of USD 3 billion of aid annually to Israel . #% I also hope that the Commissioner will go some way this evening towards expressing some willingness to resolve the situation whether there are huge disparities of tax . #% As a point of principle , I very much hope that this House will reinsert the repair clause amendment . #% We , too , see this as the moment to achieve an historic settlement with Cyprus . #% What is important , and Mr Harbour mentioned this , is the maintenance of the five levels that we already have . #% Mr President , the accident in the Dominican Republic in February 1996 clearly highlights the problem before us today . #% This is to be achieved by providing Community financial support to Member States to reduce weaknesses in their fisheries control programmes and by assisting coordination of control measures , particularly via the Community Fisheries Control Agency . #% What we want to see is the kind of things asked for in Mr Papayannakis ' Amendment No 4 on minimum standards . #% I support the creation of four strands Comenius for general education activities in schools , Erasmus for higher education , Leonardo da Vinci for vocational education and training and Grundvig for adult education . #% Mr President , biotechnology is at the heart of the Lisbon process to make Europe the world 's most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy . #% However , many of these different channels of communication are now controlled by the same media conglomerates , which can thereby cross-promote these services and provide incentives or pressure advertisers to buy space or air time in other media they control . #% I am therefore pleased that the Committee endorsed my amendments which emphasised that the impact of legislation should be fully assessed , and specifically , that the Commission should provide support for the development for water recycling systems , such as the one recently established by a processor in my own area in the north-east of Scotland . #% -- Mr President , last month in the city of Neka in Iran a 16 year-old girl accused of offences against chastity was publicly hanged from a crane . #% Globally , one woman dies each minute from pregnancy-related causes , about 200 000 maternal deaths per year result from the lack or the failure of contraceptive services , at least 75 million of the 175 million pregnancies each year are unwanted , and rape and other forms of sexual violence are increasing , including in Europe . #% I thank the rapporteur in his absence . #% The Zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future . #% Like the rapporteur and previous speakers , I think it is a pity that the Council chose to reach a political agreement in advance of the debate in this Parliament . #% As the Commission will know , the proposals for any new ACP-EU agreement could be based on regional cooperation and integration , with funding being distributed via the regional organisations rather than through individual nations and national indicative programmes . #% I invite the rapporteur and members of the Socialist Group to be bold and to welcome a limited degree of competition . #% We have four important issues in front of us this morning and I want to concentrate on salmon in particular . #% Moreover , President Barroso , you will need political will in the Council and support in this House for your reforms , neither of which is yet fully evident . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the Hedh report . #% A standard definition should be welcomed in order that there can be no loop-hole in the use of these destructive nets . #% Liberals and Democrats view with concern the direction of some of the Council 's policies : to undercut the Americans in some downward Dutch auction of human rights standards would be an affront to the dignity for which Europe 's people have fought so hard . #% It is important in airports which are run as commercial entities that they retain the flexibility to apply non-aeronautical income to subsidise aeronautical charges at their own discretion . #% Very importantly , there are attempts to impose European prohibitions on ethical aspects of research and therapy which are clearly the subject of the subsidiarity principle and which it must remain the right of Member States to decide . #% We ought to support it . #% Mr President , surely if the rapporteur is requesting a referral back to committee of her own report , and there is a dispute , then the House should vote on this ? #% We are very strongly in favour of this directive and hope that it will leave this House in a really strong form . #% Why not establish urgently the first pilot regional advisory council - or management council , as I would prefer - and give it the task of helping to devise measures to save the stocks of white fish in the North Sea . #% I would advise you , Mr President , that while I seem to be alone in my objections to these particular impositions , I can assure you that many Members of this Chamber from all political groups are as concerned as I am about the imposition of Rules from a Bureau which does not make itself accountable to this House . #% in writing . - I voted for this report because there was nothing in it to object to . #% Mr President , today we have a chance to remove the barriers which have held back meaningful discussion on the whole question of the Statute of Members . #% Official UN figures predicted up to 9 000 cancer-related deaths as a result of that accident . #% A thriving market with job security are not achievable within the context of the CFP and control of fisheries management must be returned to the nations dependent on fisheries . #% I would also like to draw the Commission 's attention to compromise Amendment No 23 , which highlights the difference between the rates of excise duty on wine , beer and spirits and says it should not be increased . #% I draw attention to the importance of ensuring that the court system functions free of political interference and welcome the efforts to increase the efficiency and transparency of the court system . #% Tax rates are for the Member States to set and clearly they are quite unwilling to sign up to the long-delayed directive on taxation of energy products . #% Thirdly , I agree with them that implementation and enforcement of environment policy are tremendously important issues , but I would ask them not to reach an agreement at the first Environment Council but rather to wait until the second one so that they can have the benefit of consultation and discussion with Parliament on this very important subject . #% That is why we also need to have a balanced immigration policy . #% I noticed in the ninth EDF that 90 % of the funds will be going to the least developed countries . #% But I would suggest that we must work with the fishing industry and make sure that it fully understands the problems . #% That is why I will vote against recitals O and R of Mr Musotto 's report . #% Reliance on this original wording , put forward by the Commission , is ambiguous and would effectively lead to substantial delays to development . #% Opt-outs were offered as essential ingredients at Cancún and must be part of any future plan . #% That is a good feature of his proposals . #% The Committee on Industry suggests that Parliament support the Commission 's praiseworthy attempt to reduce unnecessary regulation and vote against the Committee on the Internal Market 's proposed extension of mandatory sizes to all these extra products . #% It is up to nations themselves to develop this . #% On Europe Day , Estonia became the fifteenth state to ratify the Constitution and Finland will soon follow . #% Since our November part-session , we have had contacts with the other institutions , though as yet no agreement has been forthcoming . #% We are making great strides but I will vote against Amendments Nos 11 and 18 because I believe they are almost impossible to attain , will demoralise the industry and add very substantially to the costs imposed on waste site operators and on local authorities . #% Therefore the independence of meat inspectors would be compromised , as those paying their wages would then be the companies they are in charge of inspecting . #% My point is that the way you have conducted business in this Chamber today was correct . #% The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability . #% You give a very factual and clear answer in terms of the current situation , but I should like to ask you personally , as Commissioner : do you feel that driftnets , with their indiscriminate catch , can continue to be used in European waters ? #% Mr President , I would like to concentrate on the threat posed by the Commission 's proposals in terms of the privatisation of the independent meat inspectorate in the United Kingdom . #% I would suggest that we do not wish to go down that road again . #% Mr President , as the Member who has the honour of chairing the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino and Ministers Bodström and Klingvall for the spirit of loyal cooperation in which they have approached the construction of the area of freedom , security and justice . #% It is a success story , because here we are today looking at legislation that we are putting through this Parliament , which is great . #% The resolution recalls that good neighbourly relations are one of the most important preconditions for progress by ENP countries towards EU membership . #% It is important , therefore , that we keep institutes such as the Torry Institute and that we ensure that food hygiene in fish is of the highest possible standard . #% What have the new Member States found in their brave new world ? #% That is the engine for NEPAD -- the economic engine that can bring about development . #% author . - Mr President , the European Union in general , and this Parliament in particular , has a very proud record - an honourable tradition - of opposing the death penalty . #% 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , EU growth in 2006 hit 2.7 % - the highest in six years . #% Do we demand a stronger , more credible Europe at home and abroad ? #% It is rare in my experience for a presidency to receive such wide praise from all sides of this House . #% I have always believed that it is difficult to transpose a European-style election procedure onto some developing countries , as they do not have the capacity to properly prepare the paperwork . #% Members will also recall that last year 's report on leghold traps by Carlos Pimenta , which called for their banning , was supported by a huge majority in this House . #% Where they have signally failed is in the field of international cooperation between law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the Díaz de Mera García Consuegra report on the exchange of criminal record information between Member States . #% However , when the Prestige disaster occurred last November and the shores of Galicia were covered in layers of black oil , we began to search for emergency aid to alleviate the catastrophic suffering of the fishing communities in this region . #% I wonder whether representatives of the oil companies or the bus companies are trying to get a squint at what the Socialist voting lists were . #% Your propensity to play the fairy godmother means , I am afraid , that the naysayers - die Verfassungsfeinde heissen sie immer noch in Bayern - were rewarded in proportion to their negativity , while the friends of the Constitution - the silent majority - received precious little for supporting the Constitution signed by all Member States in Rome . #% Perhaps we could best bring it home to the US by suggesting that it thinks about a blockade policy towards Saudi Arabia and other client states of the US where no democracy and human rights exist and very little concern is expressed by the Americans about them . #% However , with the flow of drugs apparently on the increase and the level of addiction rising particularly among some of Europe 's most deprived communities I would like to see the Centre raise its profile and make a more significant contribution to tackling these problems . #% The idea that this is popular is killed by the fact that , on seizing power , the president has had to ban all public demonstrations for two months . #% I call upon the UK Government to abandon its previous resistance to taking part in such a process . #% We believe that while geographical origin is important , it is certainly not the conclusive or definitive factor . #% On paragraph 66 , in particular , going forward , I would be very grateful for an indication from you , Commissioner , of how you view the call from us for a three-year moratorium on EID - electronic identification of sheep - cross-compliance penalties . #% I know this is slightly confusing , but it is a confusing directive ! #% The Lusaka and Arusha peace accords have failed to end the violence and internal conflict . #% This is an attempt by my New Labour colleagues to save the British Government embarrassment . #% I welcome much of the output of the committee so far . #% When the poor have an economic stake , then civil society and democracy will take root . #% When the time is right the people of Kashmir must be given a voice in determining their future . #% Mr President , again I congratulate the rapporteur on his report and note with satisfaction the progress that Romania has made towards membership of the Community . #% Accordingly I have voted against this report . #% Germany plans to close uncompetitive mines by 2018 and the rapporteur has proposed an amendment to extend the proposal to 2018 . #% As the final Charter text is not available , we are supporting the Charter in principle but awaiting the final version . #% A tourist industry focused on sustainability will focus automatically on quality , which is ultimately what the consumer in this modern age demands . #% in writing . - The proposal amending Council Regulation ( EC ) No 337/2004 aims to harness the know-how and experience of immigration liaison officers for the benefit of Frontex and vice-versa , which was not a matter addressed in the original regulation . #% We talked on the Women 's Rights Committee about how we should feminise the policies more : to have effective standing committees with more women on them , to make sure there is better representation of women from the developing countries on ACP delegations , to make sure that we monitor and evaluate all development projects from the EU in terms of the impact on women within the developing countries , and to make sure the reports are fed back , not only to the Commission but to Parliament too , so that we can see that there is a true feminisation of EU development aid . #% The President-in-Office mentioned that the question is being raised as to whether the minimum number of MEPs per state is too low . #% Quite frankly , if Air France can not provide a better service to Strasbourg airport then a lot of British Members are just not going to turn up in Strasbourg . #% It has ruled out decisions based on political expediency to the extent that Member States surrender their own nationals . #% In the same manner , tourism statistics represent a useful tool to support decision making in business and in the private sector . #% Lasting settlement will have to recognize the rights of the Palestinians as well . #% Is it not a disgrace that the right of Members has been taken away in this manner ? #% The waste water directive is a prime example where the concerns of the processing sector were overlooked . #% It advocates disarmament and demobilisation , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration of armed groups . #% On agriculture and rural development , I support the idea of increasing aid to less-favoured areas where agricultural production faces very serious and particular challenges in economic terms . #% Perhaps in the second reading the rapporteur could organise outside this Chamber an opportunity for Members to donate blood . #% As I said in my report quoting the poet Robert Frost - ` Good fences make good neighbours ' ( with an implied question mark ) . #% What talent , knowledge and experience is lost because of this ! #% We must project Europe 's voice with the unity of a choir singing from the same hymn sheet , rather than the dissonance of an unruly cacophony . #% This is not just affecting businesses , it is impacting on a whole community . #% Mr President , this is an important piece of legislation which will really help to improve and consolidate the single market by ensuring that we do not have excessive cross-border differences about sales promotion rules . #% Perhaps there are some positive signs . #% . -- Mr President , I know that the Commission proposal is based on the best of good intentions and we support good intentions in the wake of the awful tsunami disaster . #% Unlike some Members I welcome this . #% This was a decision based on political pressure ; it owed nothing to conservation and everything to politics . #% Madam President , coming back to a point that was raised earlier on : 9 May is , as you know , Europe Day and Parliament will be closed . #% But the common position , for some not very apparent reason , restricts such cover to only 50 % of the requirement . #% There is much in it that is to be commended . #% I would like an assurance from the rapporteur that relates purely to external borders into the Community . #% We have an old saying in Scotland that you can not polish a turnip and no amount of presentation will disguise the fact that the EU has a structural problem which we are not addressing . #% If these parties try to use this alliance to carve up the way things are done in this House , my group will fight them every inch of the way . #% These are the ideas in the Gemelli report which support Commissioner Nielson ' s report and good work . #% I have been listening to the debate on the television in my office and I heard your answers to my colleagues . #% So I am happy that there has been at least part exemption . #% If we create a Charter of Rights that overloads the Court of Justice , that has everybody beating a path every week to Luxembourg , we will destroy the purpose . #% I appeal to you to consider a certain flexibility in the application of any legislation related to animal transport . #% The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else , at an affordable stamp price . #% We in the ELDR Group will support the Commission in its efforts to move the Union towards the common policies foreseen in the Amsterdam Treaty . #% I am pleased to say that the Committee on Budgets agreed with us and through the global amendment has restored those cuts . #% My own nation , Scotland , still has levels of poverty which are quite shameful particularly given the country 's immense wealth . #% If we are to feel our way towards a new relationship with China , let us welcome China 's signature on Monday of the ICCPR ; but we shall know them also by their actions . #% Commissioner , Scottish fishermen and others north of 55o north are being restricted to 15 days , which they find difficult to accept , all the more when they see the industrial fishermen scooping up a million tonnes of sand eels and Norway pout , which are both the feedstock for their whitefish , and in many cases , immature haddock and other whitefish . #% Since independence , Mugabe has had much time to establish real democracy , rule of law and prosperity for all . #% 
I do not condone them ; I have always objected to and stamped on corruption wherever it is , especially in Africa . #% I am privileged to present this report on behalf of my colleague from the Fisheries Committee , Michael Holmes . #% She had been turned away by a wide variety of authorities - elected members and health authorities . #% Liberals and Democrats will back your presidency and your drive for better regulation . #% If we scrap another 20 % , the fleet will fall below the critical mass needed to sustain jobs in our harbours , ports and processing factories . #% I would suggest to the rapporteur that Amendment No 1 is trying to be congratulatory of one government in the Council when we should be looking at the Council 's overall position rather than an individual government . #% We all know that efficiency is absolutely essential . #% Starvation and death continue today . #% I want to say one last thing . #% At one end it requires that decisions be taken as close to the people affected as is consistent with efficiency and equity . #% I want to concentrate on the comitology aspect . #% This report should also add clarity to what legal assistance drivers are entitled to following an accident . #% How can we tolerate a system that sees the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , sitting in session here in Brussels , demanding quite correctly ever more draconian regulations on the sale and marketing of tobacco products that kill half a million of our citizens every year , while across the corridor the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is happily voting for an annual subsidy to Europe 's tobacco farmers of more than EUR 1 billion ? #% You have brought this Parliament closer to reforms than ever before and I have no doubt that as a result of your work we will succeed in reforming this House . #% We wish you success with other important items on your agenda : migration and other aspects of the Hague Programme ; social and economic policy ; the fundamental rights agency that we so badly need . #% The report starkly highlights some of the statistics which clearly demonstrate that more action is required . #% I know this Parliament is behind him . #% Now all of a sudden you say that the EU needs modernisation and yet not so long ago you told us that this was what the Constitution was for . #% It is vital that we take action . #% Madam President , I regret that a matter of such sensitivity to air travellers is taking place at such a late hour . #% The elephant is in the heads of the governments who gave you a weaker Commission than you deserve , and then refused to come to your aid when our House called their bluff . #% I will not summarize these just now because that would take up time from other people 's questions . #% Every one of them could pose a threat to global health security . #% in writing . - I voted for this report and in doing so , urge the Commission to ensure that fishing activities that fall under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement meet the same sustainability criteria as fishing activities in EU waters . #% The fact is that the Union makes decisions that are binding on Member States without proper democratic or judicial control , exposing us to censure by the Court of Human Rights or the constitutional courts . #% On the renewal of authorisation , I oppose the Commission 's proposal to remove five-year renewal of marketing authorisation and rely on enhanced pharmaco-vigilance to ensure product safety and , indeed , exclusivity . #% However , we must send it to the Council with as strong a voice as possible . #% The presence of observers from the Bulgarian and Romanian Parliaments can make a useful contribution to the preparations for a successful accession and I look forward to their arrival . #% European forests can be grouped in five bioclimatic zones : the Boreal , Temperate Oceanic , Temperate Continental , Mediterranean and Mountain zones ( 5 ) , compatible with the EEA 's forest typology , developed to guide policy decisions ( 6 ) . #% The roof may be the African Union , the walls may be the pan-African Parliament , but the foundation of economic growth and the eradication of poverty in Africa has to be something like NEPAD . #% This type of action is deplorable , not helped by the fact that the UK is seen as having the weakest legislation in this area . #% The motion for a resolution on the table today reflects that . #% Because if the Council had pushed Europe 's case over bilateral bargains , we might have had a more united and principled stand . #% This report details the objectives of a plan to maintain the biomass of the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay at a level that allows its sustainable exploitation in accordance with maximum sustainable yield , on the basis of scientific advice , and while ensuring as much stability and profitability for the fishing sector as is practicable . #% Let us recall that when the Commission asked for EUR 15 million for counter-terrorism intelligence last year , the Council offered EUR 1 million . #% As for the British Foreign Secretary who was previously a leading supporter of CND in Britain , it is a disgrace that he attaches his name and support to that action as well . #% Mrs Randzio-Plath 's explanatory statement says that tax exemptions currently permitted on social grounds should be replaced with a zero tax rate . #% It is primarily aimed at maintaining law and order and security and preventing and combating criminal offences during international events attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State . #% The Scottish Executive , on legal advice and after consulting the previous European Commission , decided that under EU competition law these routes would have to be put out to private tender and private operators should be given the opportunity to take the contracts away from the state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne company . #% So we voted against paragraph 2 ( b ) , not because we oppose reform but because it is too generous a model for reform . #% It is therefore with some hesitation that I voted for the deletion of Fridays from the Strasbourg sessions . #% The situation in the North Sea is of particular concern . #% If there are rules they should be applied properly ; and if people have special permission to take interviews up there , at least the House should be informed . #% Commissioner , do you have any reason , on public health grounds , for a difference in the taxation rates on , for example , Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague 's Bavarian beer ? #% Just as at the UN Summit in Johannesburg , the European Union will have influence only if it acts as a United States of Europe . #% In my report , I have recommended the inclusion of several points of substance in future negotiations , which I hope the Commission will take into account . #% What we want is an agreement that contributes to the conservation and sustainable management of our biodiversity resources . #% Thirty years later , some might say that it is still struggling . #% In the last few days I have had the opportunity of looking at this problem and recognize that minimum import prices could be implemented straight away . #% The future of the European fisheries fleet is closely tied to these agreements . #% With regret , I am unable to support the draft Statute of Members in the form in which Parliament adopted it on 3 June . #% Although not perfect , most scientific evidence suggests that many stocks are in danger of collapse and are being over-fished by an EU fleet that is too big . #% This has been a long-standing call of this Parliament , and it strikes me that this is not just about doling out money but about sharing best practice and knowledge across the Union . #% The first essential to try to resolve the situation is to have proper political and economic stability within the country . #% This does not affect the UK and the UK applies their reduced rates through Annex H. Nevertheless , I would be disappointed if this scheme collapses . #% It leads to a lot of confusion . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , on behalf of the Green/EFA Group , I congratulate the Commissioner for coming here this evening and I congratulate colleagues , and Mr Ashworth in particular , for the original resolution which has spurred tonight 's discussion . #% Oh , heckling ! #% Mr President , it is a great privilege to take part in this important debate . #% We have the scientists , the research establishments and the scientific capability . #% It is a crisis that has driven the European Union to the position it is in , though something Michel Barnier has called the . #% I urge Israel to fully respect the internationally recognised rights of Palestinians and call upon the Council and the Commission to develop another EU observatory mission in Palestine as compliance with the EU-Israeli Association Agreement needs to be enforced , notably Protocol IV of the Agreement . #% I voted as I did in the hope and expectation that the Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee will take proper and full account of the very severe problems of remote parts of the Union in relation to this law . #% You are correct , too , that there is a cognitive dissonance between reality and political debate , that we need to get the politics right and give Europe a compelling narrative . #% Is the President aware that there are about 4 000 vessels of this type under 5 000 tonnes in the world , and less than 200 of them have double hulls ? #% Continued engagement in dialogue , sweetened by aid to those most in need , is the European way , and in the long term that is far and away the most successful . #% 
By highlighting these challenges MEPs have voted for a constructive dialogue with the Chinese in which broader questions of the social and environmental impact of rapid economic growth are taken into account . #% It has featured films from Scotland -- with world-famous actors such as Ewan McGregor -- and lectures by people like Alexander McCall Smith , the world-famous author of the series . #% It seems to me to be an utter paradox that the Commission can , on the one hand , support such a draconian regime to enable cod and other whitefish stocks to recover , while at the same time calling for the effective dismantling of the Irish Box . #% However , I would ask if she could prevail upon her colleagues to desist from claiming some sort of parliamentary immunity every time she gets arrested at Faslane . #% The skippers and crews , who have often mortgaged their homes to raise the cash to build these boats , will lose not only their jobs and boats but also their homes . #% I am sure you would want to report as a matter of some urgency . #% In conclusion , the challenge to this House is Anglo-American law and whether Anglo-American law will supersede the European model . #% Through your eloquence and your judicious use of the well-crafted sound bite you have communicated the practical benefits of our work to our citizens . #% During the current Parliament , I have had a number of assurances that the Commission is serious about upholding rights derived from Community law on behalf of lecturers in all issues involving non-discrimination . #% Well , I for one would sign up to that project today . #% You take the baton from the last runner , Denmark , and try and cover as much ground as possible as quickly as possible , before handing it over to the next presidency . #% European Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House have consistently urged all parties to support the plan and we do so again now . #% I would like to praise the European noises that are coming from the front bench . #% These communities strongly believe that exclusive competence is not only unnecessary but is indeed anomalous and unjustified . #% From what I hear , the Commission has got it more or less right and I would like to put a couple of questions for the sake of clarity . #% If the House accepts the oral amendment it can be voted on in that way . #% in writing . - The European Globalisation Fund was created in order to provide assistance for workers suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns . #% That , surely , is about the most unsatisfactory way of conducting things that can be imagined . #% Lastly , on page 17 - which is a little more complicated - I am wrongly described in the last paragraph as requesting ` that the matter be referred to the Rules Committee ' . #% Every one of us carries the burden of building the legitimacy of this House and thus European democracy and the work that it does - but none more than you . #% Where we can prove an airline was at fault , how would that situation be so different to the situation with Pan Am where so many difficulties compounded the question of compensation ? #% That is where this motion really could be better . #% No serious person would question the desirability of protecting workers from skin cancer . #% Let us include also in that area the Egyptians , the Jordanians and , hopefully , even the Iranians and the Iraqis . #% Mr President , like everybody else here , I enormously appreciate the work which Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi did as rapporteur , partly because we appreciated so much her work as chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% -- Mr President , we were all shocked by the physical and emotional devastation wreaked by the tsunami across south-east Asia on Boxing Day 2004 . #% Could we have an assurance from the Conservative Group as to whether Mr Donnelly and Mr Stevens are currently members of that group or not ? #% frustrating progress in judicial cooperation , even judicial proceedings ; overstepping the borders of propriety , of a free and independent media , or even of electoral systems ; using the Presidency of the EU to embrace Vladimir Putin , ignoring Russia 's actions in Chechnya . #% There is a need to push broadcasters to use spectrum efficiently . #% If such fishing opportunities exist , the people who most require to benefit from those opportunities are the beleaguered fleet operating at present in the North Sea . #% The capacity labelling of all portable and automotive batteries and accumulators will be introduced no later than 12 months after the date of transposition of the directive . #% I would like to know what the outcome of these investigations were , particularly given the amount of lobbying which I received concerning my report . #% The EU must show understanding of the situation . #% They understand the system . #% I do not wish to make an issue of this , but could we have an assurance that the photograph will not be used for any public purpose and , if it is , could the Bureau make certain not only that it does not happen again but also that the Member is punished because he has given an assurance to this House that the photograph was only for personal use . #% It focuses on furthering EU interests in industrialised countries and it builds on the highly successful executive training programme for Japan and Korea and the Gateway to Japan programme . #% It is important that through the Senegal agreement , and the subsequent agreements we have achieved since then , we are trying to continue with this pattern in order to continue to provide these kinds of sustainable fisheries agreements . #% I and the leadership of the Scottish fishing industry have played a constructive role , working with environmental organisations in the consultative process towards CFP reform . #% The final compromise report we have ended up with is in danger of satisfying no-one . #% The amendments by Mr Pietrasanta and Mrs Maes , which add the points about sustainability , environmental goods and health , to the other economic points that we have been making , are important and should be adopted . #% Yet the Commission 's FVO report in February highlighted a catalogue of failures : 50 % of the farms which were inspected which were designated for exports to the EU had problems . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I would like to add my own congratulations to the rapporteur and thank him for his very constructive approach to our amendments as we were working on this in the committee . #% It is also important for Member States and the Commission to co-operate closely with the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) , the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) in a way which enables the European Union to act effectively with regard to the prevention and control of doping . #% If this presidency can publish guidelines and principles for the negotiations in December we will have the basis for an intelligent debate on future financial perspectives . #% While it is true to say that the EU institutions need reform , it is also true that euroscepticism has grown in Scotland because you have continued the traditional UK Government practice of selling out Scotland 's interests in cobbled together compromises . #% The opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , which took a liberal line , was supported by 34 votes to 6 , by conservatives , liberals and even most of the socialists . #% As more women choose to have implants - whether for purely cosmetic reasons , reconstruction after breast cancer or breast deformities - we must ensure that people make informed choices and we must put patient safety first . #% They are still too often associated with criminals . #% The Union is not the project of one political party . #% I hope that the necessary reforms can take place to allow financial support for the Fijian sugar industry to be allocated . #% The interim agreement between Papua New Guinea , Fiji and the European Community was initialled on 14 December 2007 . #% A new target for the underlying budget balance could be added , and government expenditure on investment should also be taken into account . #% I welcome this phasing out . #% The Commissioner must push for that . #% There is the eight-hour rule and the recommendation mentioned by the last speaker that animals be slaughtered as close as possible to their place of origin . #% It raises the perfectly legitimate question of whether nuclear reprocessing should continue at Sellafield . #% The Commission 's proposal sets out a package of measures which , if followed , is believed to allow the safe recovery of this valuable stock within five to ten years . #% Key initiatives , particularly in justice and home affairs , are often hampered by the absence of qualified majority voting and they end in stalemate . #% On these grounds , with the greatest respect and with regret to my colleague , Mr Gargani , I ask that this matter be deferred until the next Strasbourg sitting . #% It is a shame if we continue to allow this process of squeezing Question Time out of our business . #% It is vital to improve framework conditions for private research , since in it is estimated that the EU needs 700 000 new , adequately skilled researchers by 2010 if the target of 3 % of GDP investment in Research and Development ( R [ amp ] D ) is to be reached . #% Mr President , your predecessor , Pat Cox , put much effort into modernising our House . #% I would ask the Commissioner to confirm that such clear and transparent tax incentives would still be permitted under any proposals he brings forward . #% I shall speak to him privately about that . #% Now it is freedom , security and justice , and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security , important as it is , above the equally important needs of freedom and justice . #% That aid is 25 % of their GDP . #% 
But I also believe that we have unfinished business in relation to the recent controversy . #% It seems extraordinary to me that , when it drew up its original proposal , there was no provision for making this kind of very minor change affecting one Member State without the need for a full consultation process . #% My group supports the closer cooperation you propose with countries around the new borders of the EU , but we should not offer false hope of membership to our neighbours . #% Countries which operate a responsible policy in the good times could benefit from more flexibility in bad times to let borrowing take the strain . #% Mr President , to visitors from afar , the sea crossing to the Scottish islands is the stuff of romance , and indeed the beauty never fails to move both native and visitor . #% It is also a direct attack on the fastest growing export sector within the EU , our processed food sector . #% Mr President , as author of last year 's report on the future of the biotechnology industries , I can only welcome most warmly the high priority given to the life sciences in the Sixth Framework Research Programme and strongly supported in Mr Caudron 's excellent report . #% I congratulate the rapporteur and welcome this common position . #% Perhaps it will be the argument of our carbon footprint , rather than any other , which will finally end our Strasbourg sojourns every month . #% Mr President , although many of us opposed the basis for the recent war with Iraq , we can unite in rejoicing at the fall of the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein . #% To point out to them that unless we let low-cost labour come to where the investment is , then the investment will go to where the low-cost labour is . #% However , we must not only set high welfare standards , we must also enforce them . #% I welcome this report on rules of nominal quantities for pre-packaged products . #% We have not achieved very much in Algeria , Israel , the Middle East or , as the President of the Commission referred to , in Turkey . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , with permission , I did not give Mr Bin Laden as the justification ; I said he helped us to speed it up . #% In the EU we have far too many fishermen chasing far too few fish . #% Mr President , the Parliament 's committees on which I sit have in the last few days made important progress with legislation on both financial services and energy market liberalisation . #% Could he share with us his priorities during his tenure of office ? #% Speaking as the Member for Elgin - where we are very ashamed of the past history of Lord Elgin - I wish to say to the President-in-Office that by way of follow up to Mrs Castellina , who is chairman of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , I was chairman of that committee in 1985 when it passed a report which included the restoration of works of art in the broader sense of Mr Bertens . #% The education systems need to be reformed in order to increase the efficiency and pace of higher education , thus enabling an earlier entry into working life . #% He invented something called Salter 's Duck , a cheap way of producing wave energy . #% That is why my group is calling for support for Amendment No 70 to this report . #% It is also worth noting that the same proposal for a Council regulation in Western Waters would burst open the 200 mile economic exclusion zone around the Azores . #% As a general rule , we reject or resist the practice of holding asylum seekers in detention centres . #% We call specifically for the railway market to be opened up to new , private railway companies , thereby enhancing consumer choice . #% New Labour clearly does not respect her as much as Members in this House . #% I would be nearly happy if it was taken as an addition . #% I therefore voted in favour of calling for a ban on the cloning of animals for food supply . #% I call upon this House to demand of the European Council an unequivocal statement of Europe 's dismay , and I call upon our President to convey that message . #% Furthermore , it is necessary to adapt the legal framework to reflect recent trends in the tourism industry by introducing new variables , for instance , concerning same-day visits . #% At times like this the Union must act fast , but finds it can not act fast . #% in writing . - I voted for this resolution which commends the efforts and achievements of humanitarian organisations ( the Red Cross , NGOs and the United Nations ) as well as the Member States , and stresses the need to communicate the non-visible effects of humanitarian work and the fact that the situation was brought under control thanks to , inter alia , the provision of care for the injured , drinking water , food and temporary shelter . #% The decisions that remain will not be easy . #% Constituents all over Europe will wonder what the European Parliament is thinking and doing about that . #% To conclude , if these areas are safeguarded , it is encouraging that the Commission has decided to modernise the GSP . #% The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would certainly have preferred less . #% In particular I am pleased that the report asked the Commission to propose `` an appropriate instrument '' to codify the case law of the Court of Justice . #% During the Barcelona Summit of 2002 agreement was reached by Member States that by 2010 a third of children under three and 90 % of children aged three to six would be provided with childcare places . #% In other words , if enlargement works , if the Agenda 2000 programme is successful in improving the economic situation in Central and Eastern European countries , this will of itself reduce the flow of economic migrants from those countries to existing Member States of the European Union . #% in writing . - I voted for this report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009 . #% This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about . #% I have retabled key amendments for the plenary and urge colleagues to support them . #% A peaceful and prosperous Europe was always based on the premise that strength lay in convergence and shared mandates . #% This House is not asking to be placated or patronised . #% in writing . - I welcome this contribution to the consumer scoreboard from Parliament . #% I support this report but I believe that further discussions should take place . #% Therefore , what concrete proposals is the Presidency planning to improve the coordination between national regulatory authorities in order to ensure that there is a genuine , free and fair internal market for all operators ? #% The same goes for ICCAT , where scientists have reviewed fin to carcass ratios but have not recommended an increase of the ratio . #% The FBI Legal Attaché has said that in their professional judgment the best chance of detecting those responsible lies in RUC involvement in the investigation because of its knowledge on the ground and local intelligence . #% Security and flexibility of the labour market will enable us to respond to the challenges of globalisation . #% This is where Ireland can play such an important part , Prime Minister , not only because of the role you played in the Convention , or your experience of adverse referendum , but because of Ireland 's role in looking for what you called a return to the balance and the substance of the constitutional treaty , and in working together with Portugal and Slovenia . #% The real competition in the global economy is to attract investment capital to back new ideas and create new jobs . #% I hope this House can support this resolution . #% Is that why you require the powers ? #% Finally , again , something I have heard you , Mr President , talk about : the issue of legal advice . #% Another failure on our part to show unity would further undermine the EU 's credibility in foreign affairs . #% I have asked Sir Brian for such a response but , once again , he has chosen to ignore my request . #% This does not just concern the maintenance of sand eel stocks themselves , but the preservation of the entire ecosystem in these localities . #% It is essential that every effort is made to ensure that this so-called flagship event is managed effectively and that the changeover is smooth . #% Let us not lose sight of the good old lorry . #% Most of my comments , however , are based on a view from the outside , from Scotland , for the time being part of the UK . #% This is not the package we wanted , but there is more in it to like than dislike . #% We recognise your work , and the work of Commissioner Verheugen and the work of the hundreds of dedicated Commission staff who made the climb . #% Nonetheless , we , too , recognise that the European Union has justifiable ambitions , whether to run a coherent security strategy , generous development policy or an effective policy of regional aid and social cohesion . #% There is much discussion on project finance versus budget support . #% Mr Arafat 's record of involvement in terrorism and his continued acquiescence in abominable Palestinian terrorist acts are at least in part to blame for the current situation . #% 
It is important that we take these up and implement them . #% We felt that as this directive is part of a body of legislation aimed at dealing with various aspects of airports there ought to be some degree of consistency , and the figure we have chosen would fit in with those appropriate to the groundhandling directive . #% Will the Presidency urge the COREPER Working Group to expedite their work on this matter so that we can get this adopted as soon as possible ? #% This clearly emphasises the need for an environment that enables disabled people to be as independent as possible . #% We are calling foul , and if we are not allowed to go to the stadia , then we may go to the courts . #% For them Cancún was a step too far , too soon . #% The WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December 2005 set out an ambitious work programme for Aid for Trade and called for more assistance to help developing countries into the global economy . #% I would request that it is not removed from the report and that we take the report with the words ` the United Kingdom ' and ` the United States ' in it . #% These decisions will be regarded by many fishermen in the UK and Ireland as the last straw . #% When international law is so blatantly ignored , such bloodshed , as we have seen , is unavoidable . #% Mr President having listened carefully to the various arguments presented during this morning 's debate , I would strongly urge members of this House to give their support to the 21 compromise amendments which would stop the introduction of software patents in tomorrow 's vote . #% We all accept that there must be a redistribution of the best land in Zimbabwe , but this must be done through round table negotiations , and not with the violent acts we have seen over the last few months . #% Therefore , you have three litres of spirits and 600 cigarettes . #% Mr President , I should like to ask for clarification of the Commissioner 's remarks in relation to regional advisory councils . #% For many years he worked on the safety aspects of sea-going vessels . #% This framework is now under revision after the completion of the so-called IMPASSE project , whose aim was to develop guidelines for environmentally sound practices for introductions and translocations in aquaculture . #% For example , if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of , the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe , very hard-pressed , a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky , Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine , seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States . #% This debate can not wait for the need to underwrite a treaty that governments have already signed . #% As we came into the hemicycle Members were greeted by a demonstration of members of staff with a very laudable aim : ' Tomlinson go home ! ' #% How many of Europe 's governments would have done what Mr Berlusconi probably did and told you to take their man , , even if it left you with a Commission containing a Commissioner whose political feet of clay would probably disqualify him from inclusion in most of the European Union 's national governments ? #% Will the Commission commit itself to establishing joint monitoring mechanisms with the countries with which we make readmission agreements ? #% In this case , we have a report of an abundance of deepwater shrimp and tuna in this area . #% I also support the EU taking a leading role in strengthening the regulatory and quality-control capacity for medicinal products and medical equipment placed on the market in resource-poor countries . #% It is clearly important to know the precise cause be it pcbs , global warming or fish diseases . #% We have a responsibility to make the case for enlargement to our electorates and we must not shrink from that challenge . #% Our advice to the German Presidency is : keep it short and simple - the kind of text one might nail on to the door of a church in Wittenberg . #% The committee was alarmed that the Convention seemed to attach fisheries policy to agriculture as a mere appendage . #% Zimbabwe depends on the success of agriculture and the contribution of these farmers is vital to sustain its economy . #% Two years ago we were seduced and panicked by the horror stories of those opposed to biotechnological research . #% This would be a much more meaningful response . #% In conclusion , it is said that only three legislatures in the world make their decisions entirely behind closed doors : one is in Havana , one is in Pyongyang , and the third is the Council of Ministers in Brussels . #% Let us drop this whole question of duty-free coming or going . #% Paragraph 4 of this resolution expresses our support for the Khaldun Centre for Democracy and requires the Commission to continue its financial support for this organisation and its activities . #% As he will be aware , the economy and the security situation in Kenya are worsening . #% According to the Commission , the smart car system could reduce the numbers of fatalities on the roads by as much as 15 % . #% I particularly welcome the acknowledgement of Council and Parliament 's ` equal footing ' and the implications that has for Parliament 's access to confidential documents , its right to be informed of Commission meetings with national experts and its participation in international conferences . #% When it comes to tackling disease , Europe works . #% The issue of silicone gel breast implants is a sensitive one and this debate , as many have said this evening , is long overdue . #% This streamlining of procedures will only be slightly offset by the need to review the Community licence every five years , which , of course , is part of the proposal . #% It is now our duty , the duty of the Commission and the duty of the Member States to see that the financial services industry is given our full support in providing the essential ingredients of a successful European economy . #% Mr President , I have been here longer than any other Member , and ever since Mrs Díez de Rivera Icaza came we have been close personal friends . #% Finally , the one weakness in the Napolitano report is that it has not given enough emphasis to the role of regions with legislative authority . #% I am pleased , of course , that the EU is involved and I want to ensure that this Parliament is aware of the continuing problems in Africa , because it is European taxpayers who in the end become impatient if we are seen not to take appropriate action . #% Secondly , Israel must respect international law and its own national laws , as well UN Security Council resolutions . #% What good is it if we have health and safety but no work ? #% The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices , especially in rural areas , play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities . #% It is important that we are kept informed of the progress . #% This ducks the difficult issues posed by the need for stock recovery . #% I suspect he has sent these officials over here to fly the flag . #% They are fighting for the future of Scottish fisheries and the final decision ultimately rests at their doors , not ours . #% A Member may be allowed to draw your attention to any failure to respect Parliament 's Rules of Procedure . #% Madam President , I should like to thank Mr Funk for his report which we will be supporting this morning . #% All other amendments fall , as Amendment No 20 was adopted , allowing us to support the report as amended . #% Rather , we fear that the inclusion of sunlight in this package will add to the burden upon farmers , fishermen , foresters , businesses in general and others , without necessarily achieving the desired health effects . #% My point of order is on the central register of Members . #% This report shows how the EU can help encourage growth in this vital future technology and I am pleased to support it , even though a few of the key recommendations were not passed by the house . #% How often will it meet ? #% Yet that is not an argument for less Europe , indeed , it may well be an argument for more Europe . #% The paragraphs which draw attention to the growing problem of declining labour standards and unfair trading practices are particularly important in the run-up to the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in December . #% Instead , the Commission over-reached itself with an unnecessary article awarding itself the right to reallocate fishing quotas . #% The Council promised in the past to put sustainability in the forefront of European Development . #% With finite resources fast depleting , Europe will have to radically re-examine its patterns of energy supply and consumption . #% One last but important point , because both you , Mr President , and Mr Poettering in different ways referred to it . #% In terms of the content of the resolution , Parliament has to consent to this agreement before it can be ratified . #% Of 6 billion human beings , half are living on less than EUR 2 per day and 800 million are going to sleep hungry every night . #% As a son I obviously wish to help her , as I wish to help all visually impaired people within the European Union . #% 
We must ensure that older people remain integrated in society and that solidarity between the generations is promoted and older people are assured dignity and non-discrimination in their twilight years . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her report . #% The United Kingdom has the highest rate of takeovers and takeover battles throughout the European Union . #% Mr President , I would like to inform the House that at the end of the debate yesterday afternoon , Mr Napolitano , in response to statements made during the debate by myself and others , made the following offer : he suggested that we ought to withdraw Amendments Nos 18 and 12 in order that he might , through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , propose the bringing forward of a specific report on the issue of constitutional regions in the architecture of Europe . #% I also welcome amendments tabled on behalf of the PSE Group by Mr Kindermann , both singly and jointly with other groups , in particular the amendments that ensure that adverse effects on fisheries resources and the local economy are avoided , that the transfer is accompanied by any appropriate training , that boats are suitable and that the transfer meets the requirements of the FAO 's needs assessments and is requested by the third country . #% Although the regulation comes to an end , the policy does not . #% While the Americans were digging Saddam Hussein out of a hole in Iraq to global acclaim , our leaders were digging themselves into a hole in Brussels . #% It is clear , however -- in the eyes of my group at least -- that he should be released forthwith , because the crimes of which he is accused and indeed convicted do not appear to stack up in reality . #% A number of areas have to be considered . #% The house that we are building for our citizens should be able to withstand an earthquake . #% They can not continue to use Sharia law and these dreadful , horrendous punishments . #% This is an excellent report . #% I wonder whether that can possibly be done if we encourage privatization to take over the public role . #% They raised with me the problem of the town - the old borough . #% Indeed , a former Shetland Islands MEP was fond of pointing out that the nearest mainline railway station to Shetland is in fact Bergen . #% It is not good enough for governments to stand aside and see fish-farming and perhaps the future of fish production in the European Community being decimated by one country which is determined to gain a substantial market share at the expense of a young , thriving industry in some of the peripheral areas of our Community . #% My view is that national countries must decide on their own drugs policy . #% Therefore , the report recommends Member States to take measures to increase and improve information for patients through tracking and surveillance , quality control and assurance . #% It is not for us in the European Parliament to intervene directly between the Spanish Government , political parties and the long-running conflict in the Basque country , but nor can we turn a blind eye . #% That is a dreadful thing to happen and we should add to this admirable motion for a resolution a clause calling upon those who are in authority in Uruguay to recognise the evil of disappearances , to recognise their bounden duty to bring children back to their parents and to end this scandal and disgrace . #% Well , Korea , since the negotiations have been initialled , has signed four ILO Conventions and their trade and sustainable development forum is going to be established as a result of this agreement allowing the civil partners in Korea to ensure that greater market opening is accompanied by labour and environmental standards improvements . #% We must not allow them to derail enlargement . #% They are issues for the Commission because the Commission is going to be tested in this climate as a defender and guarantor of the Treaties . #% In the years when I had something to do with this in an academic capacity , it was notorious that it was extremely difficult within the sociology of law to find reliable ways of assessing the impact of legislation which was in force . #% Many of us would have liked wider rights and fewer exceptions . #% My committee considers that a free market works in the best interests of the consumer . #% However , a Greenpeace report released last week estimated 93 000 , which could rise to around 200 000 if we include other related illnesses . #% As Hugh McMahon , the rapporteur , has pointed out , this is really a conservation measure and this Parliament will want to support anything that the Commission brings forward by way of conservation measures #% in writing . - The Commission has proposed granting EUR 633 077 from the European Globalisation Fund to help 1 104 workers made redundant in Poland in two enterprises involved in the manufacture of motor vehicles , trailers and semi-trailers . #% This is the economic problem . #% Investing in projects such as hydrogen fuel might have the potential to achieve oil savings equivalent to 13 % of global oil demand . #% That is why Liberal Democrats insist that both the criteria and the timetable must be respected . #% As Mrs Langenhagen said , one third of EU citizens live close to , if not on , these areas . #% I see a warning light flashing here because such a move would change the legal tax basis for organizations that are exempt and possibly allow the imposition of the reduced rate or a standard rate in the future . #% Stopping Iran building nuclear weapons must be our aim . #% In Scotland , as elsewhere , we are still suffering from the effects of the Asia crisis , with promised investments failing to materialise and with delays in lowering interest rates and the strong exchange rate of sterling continuing to hit our industries and our exports hard . #% Mr President , paragraph 16 of Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines ' excellent report calls for training designed to correct school failures . #% The Stability Pact needs adjusting but it also needs enforcing , with proper monitoring arrangements like those used by the IMF . #% The real lesson of history is this : Churchill correctly identified the Nazi threat at an early stage but when he acted it was not unilaterally and pre-emptively . #% The reference to marine biological resource conservation must be removed from the list of exclusive competences . #% We must look at Article 33 of the Treaty , which gives Member States the task of ensuring the maintenance of law and order , and see whether the responses have been appropriate . #% But it is not going to be easy to get an agreement and I would like to see the document in detail before passing judgement on what the Commissioner said this afternoon . #% Young people are tomorrow 's decision makers , and it is vital that they are able to develop the competences , skills and knowledge today that will allow them actively to contribute to the growth and sustained future of the European Union over the coming years and achieve the goals set out in the EU 's growth strategy . #% The common position provides for the Commission to report on this matter within five years of entry into force of the directive . #% I am encouraged by the statement of Mr Danielsson , the confidence of Mr Solana and the excellent analysis of Commissioner Patten of the situation on the ground . #% The benefits of low-cost air travel have been felt over a much wider area than just around Charleroi . #% We in this House must play our part , as we did in the Orange Revolution itself , though today we must continue to support the forces of progress and democracy within the Ukraine . #% I agree with Mr Ozdemir 's recommendations and voted in favour of the report . #% For all our grand plans for transnational cooperation , we have failed to explain to people what we are doing at European level and why , and to address their fears about jobs , careers and a productive retirement in a fast-changing world . #% We would also suggest that the Commission instigate research into the implications of ultra-fine particle emissions from gasoline diesel injection engines . #% The European Parliament can not afford a superfluous excellency , because you will be our voice ; you will speak for us in the Council ; you will be the will of this House : you will be our resolution . #% Eighty-seven people have been hanged in the past four weeks . #% My question was next . #% For example , if we are setting up a register at European level , what action do we propose to take with the names entered on that register ? #% The implications of civil war and escalating violence are of immense and imminent proportions , not just because of Albania itself , but because Albania is a powder keg . #% Today a parliamentary delegation from Norway is visiting Parliament and wishes to discuss the matter with us . #% This list is , however , neither exhaustive nor prescriptive . #% Nice showed the failures of intergovernmental Europe . #% The main thrust of our aim therefore must be better education leading to better health care . #% I welcome the Commission proposal because it improves the situation for people who need to claim compensation in the event of an accident , both in terms of the amount they will receive and the speed with which they will be helped . #% The strength of many African states can only be developed on the basis of good economic regional cooperation leading possibly to political integration at a later stage . #% In its infancy it questioned the eligibility of British membership and rejected its application to join . #% It is an indication of the breadth of support across the committees for the sentiments which the three rapporteurs are presenting . #% Without a coherent intellectual property regime across the European Union , we will create few new European companies . #% Parliament , in its Amendment No 2 , proposes that we give EUR 885.5 million to South Africa , EUR 98 million more than the Council . #% The reforms urged in this report all go in the right direction . #% 
Surely , it is not too much to expect each individual to have done enough homework to be able to demonstrate that they have mastered their brief . #% We voted on 12 amendments with one vote . #% I should like to ask you to refer this matter to the Bureau for investigation . #% If we look at the summary and the key information document - Dr Klinz has spoken about that and the need to have clarity - I think we have reached a wording which will ensure clarity , whilst being clear that civil liability remains with the base prospectus . #% That would enable the Commissioner and everyone from the Committee on Fisheries to be present for all of these reports . #% I know Commissioner Nielson understands this and I know he is working for it . #% Is the Commission going to bring forward something in writing ? #% Then perhaps we will see subsidiarity starting to work for the betterment of EU legislation in the future . #% The convergence criteria and the rules to counter excessive deficits , for example , are among these and must be respected . #% It also has a lot of sympathy for the amendments submitted by Mr Bushill-Matthews but feels that the Weiler report is not the appropriate report for such amendments . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he agrees with the President of the United States of America that perhaps Europe 's position on trade in genetically modified crops is having an effect on our trade with the southern African countries in agricultural products , thereby affecting their ability to feed themselves ? #% As part of that process you have worked to make the Commission 's relationship with this House open , productive and respectful . #% We must be very clear that we all want patients to be informed . #% Therefore , my group particularly welcomes your initiative to open the discussion on flexicurity . #% Mr President , before the Minutes were approved I tried to catch your attention concerning a point of order that was raised yesterday by Mr Imaz . #% You tried to turn that slightly in your answer earlier by saying it is up to the individual Member States to look at that and to look at ways of utilizing the Structural Funds by diverting them into those areas that may have unemployment caused by the abolition of duty-free . #% The fact is that women already contribute significantly in economic terms in both the public and private spheres . #% Cooperation between France and Spain or between Britain and Ireland has improved in recent months and yet the opportunities offered by the Amsterdam Treaty for more effective action have not been grasped . #% We wish Mr Busquin , his team and this programme well . #% I am glad to see that the article by the Prime Minister in today 's Times effectively confirms that . #% The evidence is very clear from my knowledge of the programmes as a former lecturer in higher education , that the more we can get young people across Europe meeting and talking to each other , the more they will understand the importance of Europe and the importance of building Europe . #% Our generation has aspired to , and achieved , more than our parents could ever have dreamt of . #% We in the European Union should be concerned about all aspects of safety in all modes of transport , not just two-wheeled vehicles , four-wheeled vehicles , trains , planes , boats or whatever , but also in relation to cable cars and cable installations . #% The vast majority of young people who travel across our borders for language courses enjoy a very good experience and their first visit abroad is a very happy one . #% We will look to you and your Council colleagues to be vigilant and true to your commitments . #% Clearly , their purpose is to prevent all advance in this area of great scientific promise , for that is what these present texts from the Trakatellis and Scheele reports would mean . #% European industry is gearing up for the challenges of competing in a global economy . #% It is a backward step to a world of unequal and exclusive bilateral deals : deals that are already strong-arming many poor countries into accepting lesser terms on market access and intellectual property rights ; deals that are leaving the poorest countries out in the cold . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the House for having this debate during a prime morning session - normally our debates are at midnight ! #% Ireland , a member state smaller than Scotland , has provided inspiration to those of us who aspire to see Scotland resuming all of the normal powers of an independent nation , speaking for ourselves in the International Community , and cooperating with our neighbours on terms which suit Scotland 's priorities - not London 's . #% If they conspire to block the necessary reforms in this House , we will stand up for the interests of the citizen . #% These factors are driving UK pig farmers out of business as more and more cheap imports are sourced by retailers and supermarkets in the UK . #% We are also concerned that the proposals as they stand will not necessarily result in any major real environmental benefits : production methods for most biofuels use substantial amounts of energy and create high carbon dioxide emissions . #% After the new Constitution comes into effect , if it does , the number of Members representing Wales in this House will drop to four . #% He has now given the job to the Leader of the House of Lords and women 's issues have tended to sink without trace . #% Amendment 1 is placed first on the voting list , and I recommend support for it . #% We , therefore , welcome the Commission 's conclusion that the ten applicant states will be ready to join the European Union by 2004 , but that monitoring of their preparations will continue . #% I hope that the three conditions , the conditional discharge and the obligations on those concerned to address these conditions will be taken seriously . #% I am grateful to the Commissioner for his answer . #% I therefore recommend to the House that we take the action suggested in my report and that we draw these cases to the attention of the Italian authorities . #% AIDS fractures and impoverishes families and orphans millions . #% Mr President , this debate has been quite unsatisfactory and , under the pertinent rule in our Rules of Procedure , I wish to propose to my committee and to the House that we have a resolution to close this debate , to vote on it at our January part-session , and to look at what further action we need to take , given the quite unsatisfactory nature of the responses from the Council and Commission . #% We seek too to insert safeguards for civil liberties by basing action clearly on international human rights documents , by reinforcing the principle of ne bis in idem , by taking account of time spent in detention awaiting trial and by allowing Member States refusal to extradite when there are manifestly sound reasons for doing so , including in those cases where a person found guilty could face a penalty of death . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying how delighted I am that the presidency is prepared to put some pressure on the governments which , in turn , I hope will put pressure on their parliaments to proceed with ratification . #% Finally , this is the sixth report I have spoken on today on behalf of the Green Group . #% But in their rush to advance their own interests , the Member States are failing to ask what might constitute the best deal for Europe . #% There are a number of obstacles preventing this . #% Secondly , we find it hard to imagine Parliament approving a trade deal with Canada while Canada pursues a challenge , through the WTO , on the EU 's trade ban . #% That is why we will be opposing Amendment No 16 while supporting the rest . #% We know that Ukraine is heavily dependent on this type of energy , so we have to face up to this . #% Objectives such as creating more efficient recovery procedures in transit operations and shortening the time taken for discharge are of considerable importance to our industry for cutting down their costs and burdens , especially considering that the procedure can take up to five years to be completed at present . #% The report is , therefore , unfortunately basically flawed . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , while we sit here debating the recent uprising in Iran , do we realise that over 50 of the student leaders , the protestors who were arrested , have been taken out and hanged by the Iranian authorities , that over 200 people were killed on the streets , including Neda , who has become an international and very potent symbol of the brutality of that fascist regime against the people of Iran ? #% The work already undertaken in Scotland will fit nicely into the proposals of the EU and together , we will be more able to better understand and help prevent Alzheimer 's and other degenerative conditions . #% I hope the Commission can give us these assurances this morning . #% Madam President , I protest against the rather intemperate remarks of Mr Balfe . #% The peace-building aspect of the programme is crucial for the future of Northern Ireland and offers lessons for other EU Member States with a history of conflict . #% in writing . - I voted with a heavy heart against this resolution . #% I am pleased therefore that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has accepted the gist of our proposal for a tiered derogation procedure which such producers can invoke . #% We must , therefore , all encourage Zimbabwe to move towards elections in May . #% The Instrument is in two main parts - geographic and thematic . #% How sad and pathetic it is to watch Robin Cook , the British Foreign Secretary , instead of travelling around Europe to help stop the war , trailing around the Gulf States to persuade them to let the US and Britain bomb Baghdad . #% The agriculture sector in Scotland is also suffering greatly from high fuel costs , not just through the direct use of fuel on farms , but also owing to the excessive cost of sending their produce to distant markets , an economic pressure which the UK Treasury has also added to in the form of unjustly high levels of taxation . #% Neither should we forget , however , that it is not only our own voters who have to be convinced . #% The burden on the NHS of uncontrolled use of cross-border healthcare could have been enormous . #% Social security : workers moving within the EU #% 
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate ? #% Have these people never heard of the precautionary principle ? #% Having arrived at the airport and boarded the plane , I was told my flight had been cancelled . #% New threats from terrorism and sabotage - as we have seen in Iraq - and our increasing dependence on energy from outside the EU pose huge challenges . #% However , if we are really to restore public credibility in the European Union , as we both want , we must do more than simply retable the existing Constitution text . #% But surely the most appropriate response that we , as democratic politicians , can bring to those countless victims is to ensure that there will be no more victims . #% Therefore the recommendation of the Conference of Presidents was that these should be taken together as a package when Mr Corbett 's own report comes forward . #% The House might be interested to know that Mrs Redondo very kindly accepted my invitation to come to London during the formulation of this report to take evidence from representatives of the UK pig industry and senior officials from the National Farmers Union and the Ministry of Agriculture . #% Although most of the stronger amendments failed , I voted for the report in the hope that the Commission proposal will lead to some progress in addressing significant welfare problems in the chicken meat sector . #% I am calling on the European Commission to look again at this package and to accept that the unworkable and discriminatory nature of its regulation must be re-examined . #% Madam President , my group will be voting against this directive . #% We must avoid a situation where no answer is given because a society where citizens are afraid of their institutions - and perhaps more importantly institutions are afraid of their citizens - makes for a very weak democracy . #% What control will it have over organizations such as the Torry Research Station which is now split between three or four different agencies ? #% In short , I want this Parliament to become a real debating Chamber - a Parliament where the general public can hear lively debates over real political choices and one where every Member feels that they have the opportunity to participate . #% I hope this is not a presage . #% Mr President , I should like to welcome the Commission White Paper and the Sarlis report . #% The report is correct to be critical of the UK 's record on this and my knowledge of the Dungavel detention centre in my constituency of Scotland illustrates the UK Government 's failures . #% in writing . - I welcome the Commission review of the SBA and express support for the new proposals focused on further improving access to finance , enhancing market access and continuing debureaucratisation through strengthened governance and monitoring and through smart regulation and measures such as the SME performance review #% We must , however , clarify UNIFIL 's mandate to turn the UN resolutions into reality on the ground . #% As the House knows , in order to tackle dwindling cod stocks in the North Sea , the Irish Sea , to the west of Scotland and the Skagerrak , the Commission are calling for massive cuts of up to 80 % on the cod and haddock fisheries and significant reductions in other parts of the white fish sector . #% Any reform must encourage the further and greater use of those rights . #% Secondly , it is clear that more choice and flexibility in the labour market is needed in Europe . #% Why is the olive oil industry receiving an 8.9 % increase providing them with almost EUR 2.5 billion next year , and most shockingly of all , how on earth can we justify giving to tobacco growers an increase of 2.8 % taking their subsidies to over EUR 1 billion when we know that tobacco products kill half a million of our citizens every year . #% I , therefore , warmly congratulate the Spanish Presidency on securing a deal on the pensions directive - which had been blocked in Council since July of last year - as well as agreement on the market abuse directive , because behind the sound and fury over illegal immigration it is steady progress on technical but vital issues such as these which show the worth of a presidency . #% When I find out that part of the reason for the delay is reindeer running on the runway of the international airport in Strasbourg , I find that utterly incredible . #% Now my Group and my party in Scotland is in favour of EMU . #% This is not stressed enough in this report . #% I am pleased to see that he is alive and well in Justus Lipsius . #% I would remind him too that Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees media pluralism and if that Charter is integrated into a new constitutional treaty , as Liberal Democrats hope it will be , would that not provide a necessary legal base for action ? #% I represent an electoral region which has had an independent legal system with a distinct tradition in justice and home affairs for over 500 years . #% It is a great trading nation , it is an exporter of people , not least to this continent , and it is a vital ally in the fight against terrorism . #% I think we have an ` understood ' set of five levels and these should be retained . #% We must take account of this . #% . I voted in favour of sending this flawed proposal on Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation back to the Committee . #% A strong Directive which deals with concerns about the environment and the health risks of GMOs could go a long way to ensure we realise the potential benefits from GMOs and avoid the pitfalls . #% I should be grateful for an answer to those questions tonight . #% Finally , the one point of difference between the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mr Napolitano was whether there ought to be articulate and express mention of the role of regional parliaments with legislative power in this report . #% In fact , they have to be done on a one-hour inspection . #% This applies to citizens of the EU as well as countries and citizens throughout the world . #% Both the transitional government and its international partners have failed to deal with the root causes of the conflict . #% He has given us some very good pointers such as reminding us that we are not dealing with one single Community fleet , but with fishing fleets of individual Member States and that each Member State has its own quota for individual fish stocks . #% Even as a British citizen , I see this less as a gain for Britain than as a loss for Europe . #% As Members will remember , we had to take this item off the agenda in March to allow the Commission and the Council more room to manoeuvre . #% Mr President , it is a practice both in trade union and in other negotiations to use one 's strength at a time when it is calculated to cause the most difficulty for those with whom one is in dispute . #% Most people may not be aware that calves of one to three weeks of age travel in veal crates from various parts of perhaps the entire Community to one farm . #% This issue in a sense has been the United Kingdom 's Chernobyl . #% Where the EPLP vote differs from the PSE line , the reasons for doing so are related to maintaining consistency with the UK government negotiating position on the future of the CFP . #% Europe can help rebuild civil society in Iraq through support for non-governmental organisations , trade unions and political parties . #% You then say that there are going to be tight enforcement procedures . #% The ACP countries could not cope with Cotonou and Cancún at the same time . #% The Council must unite , either to agree such objectives , to make such a commitment , to build such a consensus , or to rein in the declared ambitions of the United States . #% The decommissioning process of the plant is an expensive one as it will last beyond 2006 and after the next financial perspective 2007-2013 . #% We must work to bring the Americans on board at a later date . #% The Lamfalussy process has a key role in ensuring that the FSAP legislation works for the benefit of both financial services companies and their customers . #% None of these challenges can be faced by our countries acting alone . #% While , as Mr Bolkestein says , the agreement does not formally amend our data protection directive , it clearly amends the law as it applies to European Community citizens by making us subject to US law in this area , and the absence of protection in US law is precisely our concern . #% The Commission 's assessment was based on : the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis ; the unforeseen nature of the redundancies concerned ; demonstration of the number of redundancies and compliance with the criteria of Article 2 ( a ) ; the explanation of the unforeseen nature of those redundancies ; the identification of dismissing enterprises and workers targeted for assistance , the territory concerned and its authorities and stakeholders ; the impact of the redundancies as regards local , regional or national employment ; the coordinated package of personalised services to be funded , including its compatibility with actions funded by the Structural Funds ; dates on which the personalised services to affected workers were started or planned to start ; procedures for consulting the social partners , management and control systems . #% Culture , identity , values and the EU 's position on the global stage are intertwined . #% Calculations must be based on the operators ' liability and the risks attached to the goods . #% Part of this goal is about getting more women back into the workplace . #% They intend to demand the surrender of encryption codes and to penalise those who fail to surrender them even if the codes have been lost and are unobtainable . #% The European programme draws its inspiration from the ` Zero Tolerance ' campaign that Edinburgh Council ran in my constituency in the mid-1990s . #% Reduce the administrative burdens on businesses by simplifying data collection , especially tax collection . #% Make a note now for your coordinators : Amendments Nos 49 and 85 , please . #% We must recognise that France , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will never ratify the 2004 text . #% We discovered that the Maritime Marine Agency would not accept his qualifications , although the EU directive said it should . #% 
The Commissioner has done a great deal to try to assist Members in this House in making that happen . #% The rapporteur has broken new ground on commitology which can only bode well for the future . #% Surely in a democratic society you can at least abstain ? #% The real policies to weaken Saddam are to back the democratic movements inside Iraq , to lift the sanctions , to help the people restore democracy . #% I should like to tell Mrs Breyer that Germany permits research on embryos , even if German embryos are exempt . #% It refers in Annex IV , 2.2 , to gauge pressure of 500 HPA , where in fact it should actually refer to 0.5 HPA . #% We in the European People 's Party commend the report to the House , we congratulate the rapporteur and thank the Commission for this initiative . #% That was not always the attitude when I lodged amendments to that effect a year ago , but the groups seem to have come round to that . #% The UK currently holds the Presidency of the European Union and Scotland wants this meeting to be in Edinburgh . #% Yesterday , during the vote on my report and Mr Chanterie 's report , Mr Collins reported to the House that there was a photographer in the balcony photographing individual Members ' papers and voting lists . #% Clearly there are faults on the French side of La Manche and on the English side of the English Channel , but the victims are my constituents - hundreds of miles from Dover and Calais - in Scotland . #% We must ensure that a proper budget is established for Life + commensurate with its ambitious goals . #% Food is a fundamentally important issue and one which is going to be of increasing significance . #% We probably spend more nights together than we do with our respective wives . #% Europe deserves better . #% The OAU must be given international support to continue its work and the peace initiatives must come from the African countries themselves . #% We can hold out the hand of friendship to the dispossessed , or cocoon ourselves in an illusory haven of prosperity . #% Therefore , I hope the Council will continue its pressure . #% I became involved in working on the issue after meeting an active group of Scottish MS patients . #% But perhaps the most important and most immediate of all these reports is that on late payments of debt . #% With President Napolitano you have turned the osservato speciale into a partner speciale . #% As a proud Scot , I would like to see a specific Scottish presence in cyberspace and I believe your own country , Mr President , has shown us the way with the ` puntCAT ' designation , which you so recently achieved for Catalonia . #% In addition to the farm-gate price pressures which all farmers face , Scots producers , especially those in Highland and Island areas , have to cope with high costs of transportation and other challenges such as climatic conditions . #% Nepal 's problems demonstrate the weakness of the EU , but the recent reinstatement of democracy gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our strengths . #% Democracy , transparency and accountability must be the building blocks that shape the future of our Union . #% It is therefore a horrible irony that the United States is one of the few countries in the developed world which still retains and practises the use of the death penalty . #% I accept that it can be difficult to quantify the positive benefits in terms of job creation , but I am also convinced that suddenly reapplying VAT to labour-intensive services will have a negative impact . #% The report was supposed to simplify fishing authorisations . #% I supported the Court of Auditors ' view that discharge can be given to all seven institutions . #% I therefore urge the Commission to look into bringing the different information together on a regular basis , whether through Europol , Schengen , or the chiefs of police ; and look into making public what can be safely be made public , in order to demonstrate that we are acting as a Community to tackle international crime . #% This is worrying and must be rectified . #% Boa sorte ! #% Most consumers would like to know that the tuna we eat has not resulted in dolphin by-catch deaths . #% I would like to congratulate Mr Herman on his passionate speech and on his need to inform , prepare and reassure . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner what actually happened at the meeting yesterday . #% I believe that the preferred option should be that blood is given voluntarily . #% Therefore the Member States have a responsibility . #% That is wrong and Parliament is right to say that at some future date we should be challenging this in court . #% It has after all repeatedly pointed out that there is no legal obligation upon it to consult regional advisory councils . #% A number of experts has testified that the nature of that contamination makes it almost inconceivable that it was spread deliberately . #% It is also a reaction to Europe 's centuries of bloody wars . #% Perhaps it is even more attributable to a lack of willingness by science and industry to communicate clearly and systematically . #% Have they been granted permission to take these pictures ? #% Even putting aside the wider benefits that the European Union buys , the EU needs a budget consistent with its responsibilities . #% It is worth remembering , as Mr Casaca said , that these were the terms of an agreement drawn up at the time Greenland left the European Community . #% It may be that we need to refer the matter to the Group of Three Wise Persons charged with investigating the situation in Austria . #% In the main fisheries inspection centre there is a large screen on which dozens of tiny lights indicate the position of each fishing boat in the North Sea and around the Scottish coast . #% These are all very worthwhile objectives . #% I am pointing out these things for this Parliament and for Commissioner Nielson to put at the back of their minds because much has already been said and will be said . #% What about Japan and others ? #% I am in favour of retaining specific quantities for staple foods as I believe it is important to maintain nominal quantities in the interest of the British consumer . #% About a year ago the Commission sent out a questionnaire to all Member States and organisations throughout Europe , to people in the industry , consumers , processors and others . #% My view , and that of many Scots , is that the CFP should be concerned with the market in fisheries products , but that control and management of the resource and of catching opportunities should be returned to Scotland . #% However , I wish to express my concern , and the regret and disappointment of myself and the Group of the European People 's Party that progress towards liberalization in this field is painfully slow . #% The volume of traffic and number of passengers travelling through Stansted Airport , which for the most part is very welcome within my constituency of North Essex and South Suffolk , is increasing and obviously passengers want to know that their safety is a paramount consideration . #% Thus even when the cod stocks are restored , there will be no viable industry to go out and catch them . #% Mr President , since this is the season of good will , could you use the good offices of the presidency of Parliament to resolve a situation which has occurred in London ? #% I am , however , very pleased that the President-in-Office drew attention to the cost of non-enlargement , which is by far the greater . #% That is why my Group wishes to see the return of the United Nations to Iraq as soon as the security situation allows . #% Members have raised very interesting points . #% I do not understand how the Commission can possibly go on with this policy . #% Like her , we would always prefer a transparent tendering process . #% But when it comes to immigration , no country is an island . #% My staff asked for it in Parliament this week and I asked the Parliament office in Edinburgh if they could provide it . #% Our Rules of Procedure which will I hope be amended in the light of the Duff report make elaborate provision for the steps Parliament should take in order to decide whether or not to waive immunity on receipt of a request from the proper authorities of the Member State . #% I consider that these initiatives improve the authorising officer 's guidance and control . #% 
It is essential that these are done . #% We do not want a two-speed Europe with an information society benefiting only the industrialized regions . #% First , regarding Aid for Trade , funding for implementation is crucial to achieving the agreement 's objectives of economic diversification and poverty alleviation . #% Mr President , it is now four years since the Commission published its original proposal for the introduction of a Community-wide CO2 energy tax . #% But in particular I welcome the fact that this strategy also addresses those Member States not yet taking part in monetary union , since of course we will be affected whether we join in or remain out . #% We consider it absurd to have a single market without the accompanying single currency . #% On page 22 it states that I did not vote . #% And Scotland itself has extremely varied regions . #% Mr President , when we embarked on this exercise all of us knew that the reform of the Commission was never going to be easy , it was never going to be smooth and it was never going to be quick , because we had 40 years of entrenched views and in trying to change that we were always going to have to overcome some problems . #% Mr President , you will note from yesterday 's Minutes that I asked the President-in-Office to rule whether Mr Titley 's personal attack on me casting aspersions on my mental health was a crime against the rules of the House and I ask you to rule on that point . #% Indeed , we currently have a deficit of ECU 24 billion per annum in hi-tech trade with Japan and the USA . #% In that context , we raise the issue of subsidiarity . #% Mr President , I should like to make a point of order . #% Europe is of course though far more than a common market and your presidency recognises this . #% The impact of these measures has not yet been analysed by the scientists , nor has the possibility that rising temperatures , pollution or the North Atlantic drift may have contributed to the migration of cod further northwards towards Iceland and the Faroes where many thousands of tonnes of cod are regularly being caught . #% Will upheaval in a secular Arab state advance the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine ? #% Expenditure on agreements should be eligible for Community financing only if it has been recommended as value for money under an evaluation report on the relevant agreement . #% in writing . - I voted for this report , which concerns the reconsultation of Parliament on previous Council decisions concerning the renewal of the agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and Ukraine . #% Most women with breast cancer do not want ` tea and sympathy ' but concerted action to improve treatment and tackle the causes . #% Many of these countries will need both time and financial help to compete in the world market , but these countries must understand there is no other option in this new era of globalisation . #% I once read the words of a British ambassador to Dublin who said : ' This is a land where words can turn into weapons ' . #% Food safety is a key priority for consumers and this regulation will lay down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption . #% This will inevitably take time : it would be foolhardy to rush into further changes until we see how these work out in practice . #% Our monitoring must be in line with current treaty provisions and legislation in force . #% I would want a team of all the talents from right or left , big group or small group , medium-size or no group . #% So renew your frequent flyer package : Europe has never had a more important product to sell . #% Therefore , the second amendment tackles this whole question of the ill-fitting caps and , sometimes , no caps at all . #% The media is not like any other industry as it lies at the heart of our culture , our way of life . #% We need to think about a network of youth clubs across the Community to help keep young people out of trouble and to stop that gap between the time they leave school and their parents come home . #% I doubt it and nothing in the White Paper has yet persuaded me that is true . #% Having said that , I recognize what Mr Macartney and Mr McMahon said about it causing a very great deal of dislocation and upset to those involved in Scotland . #% Similarly , the issue of harmonisation against coordination : one man 's coordination can be another 's harmonisation and we need clear definitions of what is coordination and what is harmonisation if this is to work . #% Breathing other people 's smoke is dangerous for your health . #% The second justification - there are probably many others that the Commissioner might be able to put forward - is that ECU 2 billion is the cost of the loss in duties . #% Mr President-in-Office , your presidency has high standards of its own to live up to and the high expectations of others to meet . #% However , Madam President , if we play our cards right , these elections could - and it is a big ` could ' - be a new start in Burma . #% I am also pleased to see stronger provisions for promoting local agricultural development and local purchases as this also assists local economies and encourages local agriculture . #% Mr President , my Group should like to propose changing the title to : ` Ethiopia and new border conflicts ' . #% President Santer described the challenge of unemployment as a question of the credibility of the Council itself . #% Madam President , may we have some clarification from the rapporteur regarding paragraph 22 . #% Your cabinet , with names like Bonino , Amato and Padoa-Schioppa , fills my colleagues and me with confidence . #% They have been charged with no crimes . #% The subsidiarity protocol represents an opportunity for the Commission to do something brave and new . #% Reform of the institutions must create space for due recognition of existing regions and unrepresented nations . #% The steps which they need to take must be clearly outlined by the Commission in time for Copenhagen , so that they are clear on what needs to be done . #% ISIS has also implied severe restrictions in the fisheries of nephrops , plaice and sole with - and I quote - ` stringent restrictions on the catch and discard rates of cod with effective monitoring of compliance with those restrictions ' . #% This is particularly important , given the ownership of many of the salmon farms in Scotland by Norwegian companies . #% I fear you will not agree the budget under Britain 's Presidency . #% His funeral brought into the streets a crowd estimated at 30 000 strong . #% I welcome this report and believe that Parliament should spend a lot of time looking at what the Commission is doing and ensuring that our innovation policies , which will really foster jobs , will take us forward into the next century . #% . Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Freitas on his excellent work on this report . #% If so , could he suggest how one might go about implementing it ? #% The regime is waiting until they are 18 to carry out public executions . #% They are the people at the sharp end . #% The motion is worthy and valid and I hope the delegation of our Parliament will speak with a suitably clear voice on this matter when it visits the region . #% Our renderers can not process the animals for slaughter because a tallow lake has grown up as a result of the export ban . #% It is a huge burden of extra work for farmers , but well worth it to get the market opened up . #% The judge , Sheriff Gimblett directed the jury to acquit them on the ground that the prosecution had not proved they acted with any criminal intent . #% This point was raised at the last part-session and those people were removed from the gallery , as is only proper and right . #% It is precisely these fears which we , as politicians , have to tackle head on . #% The cod recovery measures in the Irish Sea last year cost the Irish Sea fleet a devastating drop in income of 42 % during the closed season . #% Is that also a policy that the United Nations organisations are following and will support ? #% We can only take out 30 , 000 cattle a week . #% Why are 7 of 24 instruments considered by Justice and Home Affairs ministers on 24 May still not implemented in all Member States ? #% The Commission proposal attempts to achieve an absolute minimum size of stock , sets guidelines for setting total allowable catches ( TACs ) , introduces fishing limitation through Kilowatt days and deals with the monitoring , inspection and control side of fisheries management #% As half a million EU citizens die needlessly each year from smoking yet 80 % of smokers want to give up , I hope that colleagues will see fit to sign the tabled written declaration calling for an EU no smoking day . #% 
Dementia is a huge issue throughout Europe affecting millions of individuals and families . #% Israel 's infractions of the Fourth Geneva Convention continue to be a grave concern of the international community whereby constructive efforts of Quartet members acquiescent with Israel and Palestine is imperative for furthering the development of a final and comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . #% It is therefore highlighted in this report , and I hope it is taken seriously on board . #% Very often in my country - and in others - they go into bankruptcy because of late payment and the lack of a code for that . #% I understand that the groups , the whole Parliament , are split on this issue , between supporters of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and supporters of the industry committee 's line . #% I would like to thank him for taking the trouble to call me last week and explain why he is unable to be here , and I would like to thank him and his team at DG Trade for their cooperation and , in particular , Martin Dihm for all his assistance . #% I am sure the Minister will agree with me that the Internet at the present time is still in its infancy . #% We must take care to ensure that any new irrigation schemes are properly designed , with concrete-lined channels and reservoirs , and droplet irrigation systems similar to those used by farmers in Spain . #% I do not believe in boycotts . #% That lies upon their conscience . #% It is clear that liberalising markets is not sufficient in itself to link developing countries into the global economy . #% Like everyone else , I welcome the Commission 's emphasis on employment creation but this is not only a panacea for the European Union . #% There are certain `` legal grey areas '' . #% I should to like to underline the point in paragraph 7 about subsidiarity and proportionality . #% in writing . - I voted for this report because the committee responsible considers that , in giving the interview in question , Luigi de Magistris was acting in the performance of his duties as Member of the European Parliament and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents . #% EU support can play an important part in assisting rural businesses to meet the many competitive challenges which they face . #% I regret that the European Parliament has an opinion on VAT and that this issue keeps being blocked by the Council . #% However , you must ensure that this White Paper does not merely remain a consultation exercise , inconsequential and detached from the very same people whom it is trying to reach . #% Unless countries are stable , people are simply not going to invest in those nations . #% Sadly , while ample means of support exists on the EU side , this area remains a cruelly untapped potential for Scotland , as for Europe . #% in writing . - I voted for this report , which underlines the need for more rigorous examination of projects at the application stage in order to prevent shortcomings , and , accordingly , invites the Commission to further improve the use of guidance and checklists by providing clearer criteria for assessing grant applications in order to enhance the effectiveness and consistency of the procedures and their results , and to ensure proper follow-up action in cases of non-provision of required information or action . #% We need only look at the recent power cuts on the east coast of America to see how an energy crisis impacts on ordinary people - no power , no lights in family homes , no refrigeration , millions of dollars lost by small businesses . #% China should also be made to do it in relation to European intellectual property . #% What happens if there is insufficient money for that decommissioning ? #% Secondly , the Minutes do not record that I objected to the procedure , as you requested , and you then ignored that objection . #% What is their contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS , TB and malaria ? #% It should make it easier for people moving to another EU country for work or retirement or wanting to buy a second property abroad . #% Could he give us some assurance that any of these communications or directives will include that which is enshrined , i.e. the European market conditions of co-determination and co-decision ? #% These southern agreements are always calculated on a cash-for-fish basis while northern agreements on the other hand are arranged on a reciprocal basis . #% Of course we need supervisory structures with real regulatory bite , but so too do we need counter-cyclical measures to deal with the realities of recession . #% It can not be right and justified to continue making payments based on how you farmed some 10 years ago . #% As Vice-President Haarder is already looking at these matters , perhaps he could look further into this and advise us if we are receiving value for money and if there have been other complaints of this nature . #% Wild salmon , trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment . #% However , if it is not to possible to vote on it today , might we ask the services of Parliament whether it would be possible to have the debate this evening and the vote on the Wednesday of the December part-session to allow us to forward the results to the Council by the Thursday ; and might we also ask for the assistance of the Commissioner in intervening with the Council on this matter ? #% Five years ago in Lisbon , the Member States agreed an agenda . #% The Parliament has spoken with a strong voice in the Boge report , and we must ensure that this remains our view . #% I am sure everyone in this House would wish them to know our feelings . #% Just before Christmas my mother unexpectedly lost her sight . #% The ambition is to restate the broad scope of justice and home affairs policy in the European Union . #% Clearly , there are certain parts of the EU where it is not possible to introduce a system of electronic tagging . #% Since the Commission has now made it clear that it does not intend to come forward with a new proposal , substantial amendments will be needed to ensure that Parliament can maintain its right of scrutiny over the formulation and implementation of development policy . #% Of course , any action through ACTA has to be proportional to the aims . #% On a personal note , could I conclude by saying the Commission 's proposals reflect in my view what is already happening in the United Kingdom in the provision of transport services by road , rail , air and sea , as well as combined transport . #% Global challenges like climate change , population growth and nuclear proliferation highlight what you have called ` the inadequacy of unilateralism ' . #% Only then might the extremists be moved aside and the moderates be brought together by an honest broker in a political process in which the arguments of force give way to the force of arguments . #% What has become of self-determination ? #% Too often we are proffered fine words and vaulting ambitions from Presidency programmes honoured more in the breach than the observance . #% It is fitting that the European Union should complement and underpin the peace process through the Peace and Reconciliation Fund . #% While it is important that significant numbers of cod are not caught as a by-product of other white fishing , selectivity must be applied to areas excluded from general fishing in order to allow fishermen to catch species which are not in danger . #% I congratulate you on your speech this morning . #% In accordance with the Bureau 's instruction , please note my presence in the Chamber . #% For example , one of the practices targeted by the legislation is prize draw swindles , where consumers and encouraged -- often via mobile phone text messaging -- to ring a premium-rate number for a prize that does not exist . #% Also of concern to us in the European Union is the work done by the bank in Yugoslavia , and the former republics of Yugoslavia and the Balkans . #% Nevertheless , in the end we voted against the overall package because we do not believe that it goes far enough in strengthening guarantees on relative stability , for example , on continuing access restrictions to certain waters and on enforcement issues . #% The European Union should do its utmost to avoid undermining the ICC before it has even begun its work . #% There have been leaks in the press to the effect that he was recommending a duty on Norwegian salmon imports but that he is now getting cold feet about going down that road . #% My own country struggled to meet the criteria 15 months before accession . #% I welcome what the Commissioner said about keeping Parliament informed . #% Mr President-in-Office , another item on your agenda in Thessaloniki will be the debate on High Representative Solana 's recommendations for an overall strategy in foreign and security policy . #% That is quite old - in fact , it is as old I am and that is quite old . #% It is for this reason that I supported the Jørgensen amendments and I am disappointed that they were not adopted by Parliament . #% We have this recurring problem of administration , which we must get to grips with . #% I think the Commission must take into account the specific nature of this cod crisis and not tie its hands with political deadlines . #% In any case there will not be one in time for a cod recovery plan to be adopted . #% If obstacles do occur , we can then start trying to tackle them , here and in the other institutions as well . #% This would be a step towards democracy and the Commission should embrace it . #% 
Unless we open our markets to goods from poorer countries , thus helping their people to prosper , we will take their people . #% However , I tend to the view expressed by Mr Vitorino that one has heard of both God and Echelon but one can not be sure that either of them exists . #% in writing . - I voted to give the European Training Foundation discharge for its 2009 budget and welcome the Foundation 's initiative of providing the discharge authority with the IAS Annual Internal Audit Report concerning the Foundation . #% Industry felt that the proposals on which the Commission had based their original proposals were seriously flawed . #% in writing . - I voted for this resolution which calls for the allocation of specific and significant financial , human and organisational resources regarding the participation of women and gender mainstreaming in the field of foreign and security policy ; calls for more women to be deployed in police , military and justice and rule-of-law missions and in peacekeeping operations , as well as in diplomatic mission and democracy building efforts ; calls on EU Members States to actively promote women participation in their bilateral and multilateral relations with states and organisations outside the EU ; #% This House insisted at the time that it should be accompanied by minimum procedural guarantees in criminal legal proceedings . #% Only last month on a farm next door to mine in Scotland , the young husband and father of a family died after being caught in a potato-harvesting machine . #% Unless we are capable of implementing our own Rules , some of us in the European Parliament will call upon the international community , including the Joint Assembly of the Lomé Convention , to investigate the democratic practices in this Chamber itself . #% Scotland , where there are only 162 dedicated boats left in what used to be Europe 's biggest whitefish fleet , will bear the brunt of these cuts . #% Within five days 7 000 men and boys were brutally murdered . #% in writing . - Fraud within the EU strikes at the very integrity of the system . #% In future , any such ratification must be put to all European citizens at the same time . #% Finally , the report hints at breaches in environmental legislation due to such events as the burning of dead carcasses . #% Neither Mrs McCarthy nor Mr Bolkestein disagrees with me on this point . #% Mr Alyssandrakis said that we are engaged in an effort of levelling down . #% We believe that in relation to GSP + , beneficiaries must be subjected to consistent and fairer benchmarking to make sure that their application of environmental , social and human standards remains at a high level and consistent . #% For Liberals the continuing value of Keynes lies in his insistence on solidarity . #% The Commission 's communication strategy is worthy enough in aim , but I doubt it will in fact achieve much because the reality of the EU as a whole , not just the workings of the Commission itself , are very far from ideal . #% in writing . - The devastating earthquake in Haiti last month caused catastrophic damage , and the global relief effort will need to be long-term and committed . #% The three speakers before me - the three rapporteurs - have all confirmed that the answer to that should be in the affirmative and , I am pleased to say , so has the Commissioner . #% The EU is more outward looking than it is often given credit for , and while the past years have seen internal preoccupations claiming the most headlines , most of the achievements have been external , often behind the scenes . #% We have some precedent for this in areas such as denied boarding compensation . #% This is not a particularly one-country point . #% If you want someone to help you along this path , why not give the European Parliament more of a role in the follow-up to the decisions of the Spring Councils , in holding the Council accountable for the decisions that are taken ? #% I should also like to give the thanks of probably about a third of the population of the European Union to Parliament , for I am anticipating that the vote tomorrow will go the right way . #% So that is the challenge facing Europe 's leaders when they convene for tomorrow 's Spring Council . #% It offers crops that eliminate vitamin A deficiency and blindness for millions . #% By way of example , until five years ago , my own country , Scotland , had no parliament . #% Do you speak in the name of all of your Group , or just one part of it ? #% It is vital that we recognise the importance of this very young and growing sector . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report which we should see it firstly in the overall context of rebuilding fish stocks . #% The Pimenta report calls for humane trapping procedures and was cleverly written so as to avoid conflict with the European Union 's commitments under GATT and WTO . #% The Presidency needs to show that , in the words of the Monty Python song , ` Finland has it all ' ! #% Its litany of exaggerated good intentions and its demand for yet more legislation risk the future of Europe 's businesses , of our prosperity and our jobs . #% Mr President , the Commission President has told us that the institutions must be responsible , transparent and efficient and he has promised to bring forward a White Paper on governance . #% Successes for the future depend on flexibility of timing . #% The European Union must demand a UN inquiry into the use of these banned weapons . #% And if they were not discussed in Singapore we would like to know why . #% I accept the difficulties of the logistics but that means less than a kilo per person . #% Mr President , my task is also on behalf of my group , to welcome Amendments Nos 1 to 11 and the spirit in which they were moved by my friend , Mr Wieland . #% Instead , sometimes you feel that when you have been in the plenary you have missed out on something that has been going on elsewhere . #% If countries do not pay off their debts , then we will all pay the price in higher interest rates and a weaker currency . #% The problem is , there are a further 120 massive Spanish trawlers waiting just south of the Irish Box , keen to gain access , but I do not see hundreds of Greek or Italian trawlers demanding access to the Irish Box ! #% Here we have the potential for job creation . #% I want to look in particular at the FVO report from Brazil . #% In my view , this is a sad-and-sorry ending to a sad-and-sorry Commission . #% The resolution rightly emphasises that sufficient funding , monitoring and NGO and civil society involvement will be vital if the VPAs are to achieve their aims . #% Amendment No 3 looks at the need for data and recognises that in order to have an effective evaluation of the situation in the Member States , the Commission will need more information from the Member States . #% When is a debt sufficiently diminishing ? #% in writing . - I voted for this resolution but , in order to support the Scottish fishing industry , I want haddock exempted from the regulation . #% In May the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) comes up for another five-year review by those countries that are party to it . #% This report seeks to lay siege to one such current bastion of injustice . #% I would therefore like to call for greater involvement of fishermen and the fishing industry as a whole as an essential prerequisite to the success of the CFP . #% I would like to raise the problem of our relative lack of understanding of , and failure to study , some of the principles of indirect taxation . #% Sadly , it is not enough . #% In order to be able to face the challenge of demographic change and sustain an ever-changing society , we need to ensure the determined implementation of the Lisbon Agenda . #% Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration calling for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU . #% May I also say that , sadly , these regulations are at the present time largely academic in respect of my own Member State because of course we have been banned from exporting live bovine animals from the UK for the past four years . #% I trust , Mr President , you will carry out the Quaestors ' instructions in association with the Bureau 's instructions to ensure that Members are present and either voting or not voting . #% Humanitarian aid must get through . #% First , at 1.9 % of GDP , our investment in research and development is well below levels in the USA and Japan , and with only two of the accession countries spending more than 1 % of GDP on research and development , we will be hard pressed to reach the 3 % Lisbon target by 2010 . #% I want to be sure that when developing international agreements , we do not find things arise which are oppressive either to citizens or to consumers . #% This is very laudable because , after all , we are exporting synthetic drugs to these countries , and for once we are not blaming them for exporting to us . #% Commissioner Fischler drew attention to this in his statement , and the protocol signed yesterday appears now to be able to allocate these under-used fishing rights to other Member States . #% Members are cut off at 1 minute while some of the answers from Commissioner van den Broek were very long-winded . #% As with the decision on the 2012 calendar , this is a contribution to cutting Parliament 's costs . #% 
I think the House will be aware of the extremely large demonstration that took place in Hong Kong ten days ago -- the Hong Kong people demonstrating in favour of universal suffrage and full democracy . #% If we truly believe in diversification and changing from defenceorientated production to civilian production , then we must tackle this problem . #% Mr Prodi highlighted this policy area and said quite rightly there is no reason why Europe should not lead the world in biotechnology , which is undoubtedly going to be the leading area of science and industry , of employment and improved quality of life for the next few decades . #% But , we repeat , it has to be based on the existing acquis communautaire . #% The issue is : which exact text will best achieve that ? #% I welcome your stated commitment to transparency and subsidiarity . #% The plan makes important concessions to both sides . #% Is the Commission sure that the readmission agreements it is proposing are compatible with our obligations under international refugee law ? #% Once again , we have the threat of complete closure of haddock , whiting , prawn and other fisheries related to cod allegedly . #% Mr Nielson , there was a long debate about this earlier this morning and you must accept that there is very little time between now and 1 July 2004 for all ships and ports to comply with the requirements of the ISPS Code , especially with the lack of total clarity at the moment . #% Mr President , I only partly agree with Mr Krarup . #% I am glad that the Commission and Parliament have helped to make information available in Scotland and I wish our own media would do likewise . #% That is a major step forwards for businesses of all shapes and sizes . #% Given the Commission 's general position on the needs of the outermost regions , its position here would appear to be contradictory . #% Mr President , airports are very important in the economic life of the Union and regional airports are of crucial importance . #% Europe has a leading role to play in the era of global governance . #% Would it not be better for the President-in-Office to advise the British government that the best way it can bring about stability in Europe and stability in Britain is to declare an early entry into the ERM and an early date for joining the euro ? #% It finds that inequality continues to exist between women and men both within and outside the European Union in terms of their opportunities to pursue education and work . #% I accept ECAC 's proposal that there should be a common performance model with different systems . #% For some of us in this Chamber , that is also extremely important . #% As regards fishing there is a deep-seated suspicion of Brussels in many respects and a lot of opposition to the whole idea of fishermen being told when to sleep or when to go to sea , given that their working time is governed by uncontrollable factors such as climatic conditions and the movement of shoals of fish . #% Their decision to focus single-mindedly on enlargement paid off handsomely : Europe can now reunite . #% This is yet another example of failure on the part of a Westminster Government to act in the best interests of fishing communities , and will undoubtedly motivate many voters in Scotland to vote for rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in a referendum . #% However , may I ask whether he would be prepared , along with myself , to condemn those narrow-minded nationalists who continue to utter and perpetrate racist comments within his own party against English people ? #% Mr President , I noted that Amendment No 11 included the proposition that the Community should take action in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed actions can not be adequately achieved by the Member States or - and I emphasis this - their constituent states with legislative powers that have been conferred on them by national constitutional law . #% I would ask him to consider , during the German presidency , putting this matter either on the informal Foreign Ministers ' meeting or on the Heads of State agenda so that we can look at further measures for tackling this regime . #% They exist not only in the Czech Republic but also in Slovakia , Slovenia and Hungary . #% in writing . - I voted for this report because , according to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission , the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance . #% A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view . #% As a result of 17 August all sorts of financial consequences are really impinging very greatly on people . #% We need a new and positive approach , jointly with the United States , if possible , but without them if not . #% Would it not be possible for the Commission to consider an additional approach to give even more favourable treatment to the micro-small business ? #% For the first time the Commission communication allows Parliament to state its views on the guidelines put forward by the Commission for the negotiation of new cooperation agreements with the ACP . #% At the European Council , you need an answer from Chirac and Balkenende about whether this Constitution will ever be ratifiable in their countries and if not , what kind of text might be . #% We must ensure that the outlying places are brought into this . #% It is also clear that the Commission must be prepared to listen to the advice of fishermen as well as to the dire warnings of scientists . #% I saw a lot of time wasted this afternoon . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , I will be brief , although I do think Mrs Lulling 's idea of cross-pollinating speaking time across the groups is certainly one to be further considered . #% As this claim would only be allowed on follow-on formulas , this is crucial . #% Scottish salmon farms are standing at a critical juncture , with decisions on buying next year 's smolts now imminent . #% We have before us a blueprint for the future with its emphasis on knowledge , enterprise , jobs and energy . #% I wonder whether we have the right Commissioner answering questions on this subject given the delay to the package . #% However , this will not be achieved merely by allowing cameras into the room for a ritual round-table debate and for the votes . #% The financial sector is largely exempt from VAT and is under-taxed , while ordinary citizens have faced the costs of the financial crisis , including contributing EUR 9 500 in government support from every man , woman and child in the EU . #% Even though there are hundreds of digital channels , we will be able to view only one digital channel at a time on all these sets because we have only one viewing card . #% By your absurd ruling based on the absurd advice you received from the staff next to you - nice persons though they are - you have denied representatives of this House the opportunity to ask a second supplementary question . #% We promise with pride but we fail to deliver . #% The European arrest warrant applies to a wider range of offences than previous extradition agreements . #% We welcome the Commission 's proposals . #% Therefore , my objective was to produce a report with recommendations that would support a programme of action that is possible to fund , practical to implement , and most beneficial to those who are the poor victims of such infections . #% I hope that will be taken into account . #% The infamous Bene ? decrees are a good example of this . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report as I support the gradual decommissioning of nuclear power plants . #% We are most grateful to him for his persistent and hard work in combating anything , be it cartels or subsidies , that impedes the operation of a fair market . #% In some countries , even the opposition does not see the need for reform ; it makes promises to citizens which can not be kept and , I am tempted to say : #% I would like to draw this to your attention . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I venture to suggest that were Azerbaijan known as Azeria , as with Georgia and Armenia , European citizens ' concern for democratic standards there would be higher . #% It is nonsensical political correctness to dismiss any requirement that immigrants should learn the language of their host country . #% Four main objectives have been identified and correspond to four specific programmes that must structure the European research effort : the Cooperation Programme , the Ideas Programme , the People Programme and the Capacity Programme . #% I ask Members to note that the leader of the Scottish national church , whom we will welcome here tonight , also took a leading part in that protest . #% In Scotland it is not just the CFP that has been bad for our fishing communities . #% I know my colleague Mr De Rossa had a genuine supplementary on the previous question and was refused the floor ! #% It must be an error . #% Mr Rocard is a former very well-known French minister and indeed Prime Minister . #% Parliament has to be congratulated on producing this report . #% I do not have time to go into all the other problems with this report . #% 
The first days when refugees arrive in Europe are crucial in determining their status and European countries must , by 2012 , improve their asylum procedures at that very first stage , according to the report . #% Labels and traceability are one answer . #% On that analysis , any intelligent interpretation would clearly conclude that France 's recent budget makes no effort to reduce its structural deficit and is clearly in breach of the Stability and Growth Pact . #% In this context it is important that the poorest countries are not subject to undue pressure to liberalise their service sector in reciprocity for EU trade liberalisation . #% Mr President , I understand it is not possible to request a change , but may one protest against a change made by the Conference of Presidents ? #% Lastly , I hope that they will recognize that we do not yet have the framework programme on water and that they will therefore encourage the Commission to reach agreement on that so that we can begin to work jointly . #% That potential is currently being held back by the shortsightedness of the UK Government , and this report will help us , from the EU side , to hold them to account . #% Can we find other means ? #% This decision will be made at a later stage as recognised by the report itself in Paragraph 6 . #% I have had complaints from businesses in my constituency of commercial banks requiring the businesses to move their accounts to those banks before money can be paid out under the schemes . #% It is apposite too that Mr Novo is the rapporteur because Portugal has a second-to-none scheme of satellite surveillance which our Committee on Fisheries visited only last year . #% . This report supports a regulation to establish a common framework for the presentation of Community statistics on vocational training in enterprises . #% But my information is that because there was a deadlock with the veterinary committee , the matter is referred automatically to the Council . #% I hope , as rapporteur , to devise a package that is deliverable and will benefit the poorest who are suffering , without being emotive , without recommending a solution that requires billions in funds , which I know will not be forthcoming . #% There is much in this report to admire and a couple of things where I think we could do a little better . #% In terms of the first part of your proposal , the question we all have to ask today is : why are we being asked to approve urgency measures at this late stage , and will they assist market recovery ? #% It sets a time limit of 90 days for extradition , giving us the chance to judge all suspects of an offence at the same time . #% I accept that Mr Fischler continues to be committed to a meaningful reform of the common fisheries policy , but I wonder whether he would comment further on the suggestions that improper pressure has been put on other people in the Commission . #% Currently , as an exception to State aid rules , the German authorities may grant State aid under the German Alcohol Monopoly for products marketed as alcohol of agricultural origin . #% I would also like to see delegate offices strengthened with more and better staff to be able to cope more efficiently with monitoring and evaluations . #% I recognise that regulating the media is a highly sensitive issue . #% If we are to close the gap , President-in-Office , between the European Union and its citizens , this will not be achieved by suspending people 's rights to free movement , especially if those people wish to exercise their democratic rights to express their views in protest . #% In Scotland , ferries provide an essential service to some of the European Union 's most peripheral and vulnerable communities . #% The CFP itself , I would contend , is not environmentally friendly : TACs and quotas measure not the amount of fish caught but only the fish landed . #% Chile is , as you know , a country with which we have one of the most far-reaching association agreements for trade and we in the House should extend our normal welcome to Senator Zaldívar . #% And yet both may be innocent of the crimes of which they are charged . #% I wonder if the services could put notices on the glass doors reminding Members to switch off their phones prior to entering the Chamber . #% It is also important to develop control capacities of third countries to ensure sustainable fishing monitoring and control of fishing activities . #% Mr President , it is customary for a speaker in my role to assure rapporteurs that we are right behind them , but in this case that would not quite be appropriate . #% I would be the first to say that the EU needs a new way of working , and indeed a new constitution , but not the flawed text so comprehensively rejected by the voters of the Netherlands and France . #% Recognising the difficulties caused by the lack of any new fisheries agreement , the Community agreed to set aside over EUR 190 million to promote the conversion of fishing vessels that had operated in Moroccan waters . #% We must not cede on this point . #% I might say that I am not at all convinced that he has made out any good argument for discriminating against older people by limiting their age to 35 . #% As Mr Valdivielso pointed out in his speech , the EU has a large trade surplus with this area . #% The important thing which some of the other colleagues have touched on is this question of peripheral nations . #% In the short term , though outwith the euro zone , there is also a substantial need for factual information campaigning on the implications after 2002 in our relationship with the euro zone , whether we ever decide to join or not . #% There are few people in the rabble we have seen invading farms who could afford the employees , the machinery , seeds and fertilisers to farm these units to give a potential export output . #% I would like to stress the importance of the very small enterprises of under 10 , which is what I am used to in my type of area - the Highlands and Islands of Scotland . #% I therefore welcome this report as a means to provide clarity and workability for business whilst protecting the interests of the millions of people across Europe who depend on rail travel both for work and leisure . #% That is good news for travellers and for coach companies . #% There is nothing to stop the Norwegian Government still assisting their producers and making an even more unlevel playing field . #% In that respect I was horrified to read that Danish fisheries inspectors last month boarded a Danish industrial fishing boat and discovered 114 tonnes of juvenile cod in a 543 tonne total catch that was supposed to be composed entirely of sand eels . #% Once that has been done , in the new situation in which the European Parliament finds itself , there is no alternative but to expand our budget . #% France is just as insular without the excuse of being an island . #% But they often need a helping hand with funding . #% However , we need new legislation now to close up the loopholes . #% Africa is littered with regions and subregions , with many nations being intertwined with a number of regions . #% But then I know , because I have had something to do with drugs , and I have recently been talking to Mr Gelbard , a Secretary in the State Department in the United States , they have spent US$ 1 , 000m on crop eradication in Bolivia . #% I consider this initiative an important practice to be followed by other agencies . #% We agreed only last year to repeal those rules and , while the consumers have not noticed much of a difference , our producers have noticed and still notice . #% We must always remind ourselves , as we call upon others outside the Union to rise to the standards of respect for persons which seem to us fundamental , that we are continually at risk ourselves of falling below the standards . #% Disunity , delay and weakness can set the Balkans alight . #% I was impressed by what President Taya has done over the years in a country as poor as this . #% Seriously though , my question is : what confidence will European citizens have in the Commission , given that Commissioner Scrivener promised away back in 1991 to carry out a study ? #% Greater competition in Europe 's cross-national bus and coach services will mean cheaper fares . #% in writing . - As technology becomes ever more advanced , it is important that the EU and other policy makers keep abreast of developments . #% You must make sure that it does . #% Or , do we want to work through , in a cooperative manner , with industry , ministers and other organisations to seek a common solution ? #% This draft report outlines the priority measures which should be taken to build a stronger Single Market that responds better to the needs of EU businesses and which would generate higher growth rates than before . #% As it is the only parliament in the world which has no say over where it sits , the Council of Ministers must , once and for all , put an end to this situation . #% The alternative to a successful Doha Round is sadly already emerging . #% I hope , therefore , that this House will unite in support of this resolution , calling for up to EUR 150 million of additional EU funding - and ` additional ' is the important word here . #% Mr Blair again displayed , despite his warm words about Europe , his lack of commitment . #% I should also like to pay tribute to a number of people who have worked on this report , not just within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market but also within the Commission and the Council . #% This is a tribute to Parliament , but moreover , this is a tribute to the thousands of women who have been fighting for years . #% Yet the Union seems more geared to solving yesterday 's problems than today 's or tomorrow 's . #% 
Parliament 's previous compromise was accepted by an absolute majority of this House . #% We should stick to our own view on social security as the main basis for help , but then have this product liability regime as well . #% Effective and enforceable quality assurance schemes too , such as Scottish Quality Salmon , should have a role , and this should be encouraged . #% We are witnessing the unedifying sight of the pro- and anti-war factions in the Security Council seeking to win over the undecided countries through bullying , bribery and even blackmail . #% The European Council also has to debate Europe 's external relations . #% So I would ask you , Mr President , to consider whether Robert Maxwell 's photograph should be removed from the photographs outside the Chamber . #% I welcome the report by Bill Newton Dunn on tackling organised crime . #% Surely , Minister , that is the whole point of the area of freedom , security and justice . #% I do think that the Bureau , in its wisdom , after hearing this confession this morning would wish to reconsider these matters . #% The interim EPA is precisely that : it is an interim arrangement , and I agree with all the colleagues who say that our objective in the long run should be a full , comprehensive EPA with all the Pacific countries , encouraging regional integration in the Pacific . #% One million tons are discarded in Europe every year . #% Here is what President Crosland said 21 years ago today : ' There was always in the context of EMU , a widespread hope that financial policy-making would pass from Member States to the Community and that the Community would transform from a customs union into a fully integrated economic union complete with its Central Bank , a single fixed exchange and a growing harmonization of taxes . ' #% Once again , the threat of hedge funds was raised in the context of amendments tabled by my group , which were designed to avoid difficulties for investment managers . #% The question for my group , however , is whether this interinstitutional agreement answers the big questions facing Europe at the moment . #% Does he not think there is some hypocrisy here in talking about a flexible labour market while politicians are going around the world saying no-one will have a job for life and that people will have to adapt and have several careers ? #% This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine . #% We have brought forward a number of points and I will focus on two of them only . #% The EU must continue to give aid to the Palestinian people and remain fully engaged as a member of the Quartet pushing the ` roadmap for peace ' . #% Two days ago , the General Affairs Council called for a comprehensive approach to combating terrorism while respecting human rights . #% The government proclaims its staunch support for the single market , but threatens to exclude the UK from the single currency . #% While the European Union emphasizes combined transport , I hope that both combined transport and conventional freight operations will be supported by this measure . #% Most of these restrictions have been imposed on goods that had been produced and left Japanese ports weeks if not months before the earthquake ! #% The law applicable to mortgage credit contracts should be addressed , with the revision of the 1980 Rome Convention . #% Therefore Mr Pasty you should withdraw that allegation . #% Mr President , ordinary people in most African countries are poorer today than when their countries became independent . #% Firstly , the general consensus amongst informed opinion in Brussels is that the British presidency has been a bit of a damp squib : it has promised much but achieved little ; and the Cardiff Summit was summed up by the Financial Times as being ` long in words but short on action ' . #% That is why it is important that these agreements be seen in the light of future opportunities which may not always exist in the future . #% Rather , the draft before us transforms principles like the free market of goods , services , capital and people into reality for 450 million people . #% It is a pity that we have not found greater consensus in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs : we have no fewer than 55 amendments from three major political groups . #% But , in giving our agreement , we do so on the basis of faith that these measures will be rebalanced with procedural guarantees . #% Mr President-in-Office , you have told us that war can still be avoided . #% Our amendments seek to ensure not only administrative efficiency but also a humanitarian approach to the position of those on our planet who deserve our support and protection . #% However , while in Scotland we are still stuck with the CFP , it is absolutely essential that the founding principle of relative stability is not violated in any way whatsoever . #% In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency has classified environmental tobacco smoke as a class A carcinogen along with asbestos , arsenic , benzene and radon gas . #% Our failure over Iraq also helped you adopt two remarkable documents at Thessaloniki : Mr Solana 's EU security strategy and the Council 's declaration on weapons of mass destruction . #% Mr Schmit , Mr Barroso , we do not blame you for getting us into this mess , but we look to you for leadership in getting us out . #% The Portuguese Presidency is to be congratulated for their readiness to put this matter on the Council ' s agenda . #% The 1997 Daphne programme was heavily oversubscribed with less than 10 % of applications receiving funding . #% That is also vital . #% I wondered , when you mentioned the importance of the Erasmus and Citizens for Europe programmes as a way of bridging the gap between the EU and its citizens , whether this is not slightly contradictory , given the fact that these programmes have actually suffered significant cuts in the 2006 budget . #% Can I say to this House that I understand this must be the first time that Mr Helmer has been speechless . #% The impressive festivities in Berlin were replicated in too few other European capitals . #% As a citizen - albeit a reluctant one - of the UK , I find this quite interesting because sometimes I wonder if it is a dream the Germans have because frankly the articles in the press from both the major parties suggest that we may not be going towards EMU . #% For example , it is not certain that the technical committee will have completed the technical specification for digital tachographs this year . #% We need to invest in helping the rural population to have a stake in their local economies . #% This is the last , best hope for a unified Cyprus to join the European Union on 1 May . #% President Berisha has shown some belated wisdom in bringing an all-party coalition government , and now a socialist prime minister , into office . #% On the other hand , private companies - and they are non-state actors too - do not enjoy the same status , privilege or funding . #% The new Labour London government has been afraid to show support for UK entry , or even to provide factual information , while the Conservatives have simply shown an almost deranged hostility to the euro and have attempted to mislead the public on the implications of joining . #% Once this war is over it will be imperative that the United States and the United Kingdom shoulder their responsibilities in rebuilding rapidly a peaceful , stable and prosperous Iraq for the inhabitants who have suffered so terribly under our sanctions regime . #% This report covers a number of important topics such as privacy and health issues and I fully support the rapporteur 's call for the EU to be proactive in this sphere . #% It should not be TV cameras and pop stars who alert us to starvation and drought : there should be a proper monitoring system in the sensitive areas of the African continent . #% I hope that we will be able to examine this in the context of the creation of a European area of freedom , security and justice . #% Again both the Council and the Commission have indicated a willingness to accept those amendments . #% We welcome resumption of direct aid to the Palestinian Authority and the prospective release of up to USD 800 million in Palestinian tax revenues by the Israeli Administration . #% In such circumstances , it would be madness to permit more of these sharks to be killed . #% If the proposal taken to Downing Street in the early 1980s for a British Isles Youth Forum along the lines of the Council of Europe 's Youth Foundation or the European Community 's Youth Forum had been taken up , we would be further down the path of peace . #% We call on President Musharraf to accept the outcome if it goes against him , but I also call on people in Pakistan and throughout the world to accept the ruling of the Court if it rules in favour of the President . #% Citizens ' expectations and our sense of responsibility were referred to . #% It is important that we receive some indication of the level the Commission is thinking of . #% The principle behind this report is good : equal pay for equal work . #% Mr President , on page 14 of the minutes : the list of questions called . #% This would send a good signal to them and would perhaps act as a lead , encouraging the Member States to take proper action . #% If they bothered to turn up at the committees to which they are entitled to turn up , they would know that we are not voting on this today but we are going to vote on this in January . #% Meanwhile , according to Amnesty International , there have been thousands of reported cases of rape being used as a political weapon to subdue ethnic minorities . #% This tragedy has called forth a major response in donations from individuals a world away , to families of victims they have never met , yet wish to help , reminding us how small our global community is . #% 
So , like you , we are not against international cooperation to tackle piracy , to tackle counterfeiting and to deal with other abuses of intellectual property rights . #% In connection with some of the amendments adopted in committee , we welcome the granting of candidate countries the right to observe proceedings which concern them and their country . #% Initially , the legal bases for the EU education , training and youth programmes did not provide for participation by Switzerland , but this changed in 2006 when Parliament and the Council adopted decisions establishing the 2007-2013 Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning programmes . #% How big is it ? #% There is a need to reform the content of school textbooks and to ensure that the training of educational workers be directed towards fulfilling the requirements of a balanced gender policy . #% It is right , as Mr Caspary has said , that the 176 developing countries should be given preferential access to our market . #% Are we serious ? #% However , on the one hand it would appear that the proposal looks for a management instrument to ensure no increase in fishing efforts , but on the other hand the issue of access of Spanish vessels into what is known as the ` Irish Box ' becomes a matter of real concern . #% in writing . - I voted for this report , which notes that there is a need to strengthen the gender dimension in the fight against poverty . #% Indeed , I believe he even took the wheel when going to Dunoon on one occasion . #% In addition , it is very important that we maintain within the system the special incentive arrangements for the protection of labour rights -- which are hardly used at the moment -- and the special rights for the environment -- which are also under -- used . #% It is therefore a pleasure to stand in for him today . #% There is a secondary effect of bad governance and that is the lack of external investment into these countries which denies them the chance of improved prosperity , better employment prospects and a higher standard of living . #% The role of the European Parliament as one arm of the budgetary authority is clearly important in this , and I would be interested to know whether we will , from a financial point of view , need a new legal base for this policy . #% Rule 130a states quite clearly that where there is a mass of amendments , the committee involved should try to sort them out before they are put to the vote in plenary . #% Around the coastline some 340 salmon farms are supporting some 6 000 jobs in some of the most rural areas of Europe . #% I am pleased to say that within the European Union the British Conservative government was the exception . #% On the contrary , he reported substantial disarmament and , while he recognised that cooperation was by no means immediate , he welcomed it as active , even proactive . #% The Subcommittee on Human Rights of this Parliament has serious doubts about our effectiveness so far . #% One can always point to the fact afterwards that the money was spent and other money came in and that good things have been achieved ; but could things have been done better ? #% It is in all our interests that the peace process should continue and indeed be accelerated because nobody likes the frustrations of the present moment . #% We need a common , consistent and transparent policy for dealing with abuses of human rights in third countries . #% I feel the amendments from the European Parliament have improved the proposal . #% In others a very slow process may be building up where , simply because of what is happening in the country , it may be possible to alleviate the situation before it goes too far . #% The geography of Scotland means that many of our rural areas are Less Favoured Areas which require specific support measures . #% I therefore urge you to convene the leaders of Council , Commission and Parliament before this House rises in May to agree on how to compose Parliament and Commission with legal certainty . #% We could so easily have those links and it would help everybody . #% Yesterday , as we all know , a substantial number of Member States voiced their opposition to certain aspects of the Commission 's proposals for reforming the CFP during the Fisheries Council . #% We need more economic growth but it must not be at the expense of our natural environment which we hold in trust for future generations . #% In Scotland the ` zero tolerance ' campaign highlighted that as many as one in three women had been affected by domestic violence . #% However , we have to be very clear that it is up to national and regional authorities to take up the possibilities available to them in assisting the sector during this difficult time . #% Mr Prodi , in my country politicians most often get into trouble in their brushes with the other sex ! #% Madam President , I have a request for information about a matter of order . #% Carry that spirit through to the European elections in June , to a pan-European campaign with a continental consciousness rather than 25 national campaigns , and history will give you rich reward . #% That is not what we hear from the Generic Medicines Association , which is very fearful that extension of this set of remedies to patent law will damage its interests and thus the interests of the health services of Europe and beyond . #% When terrorist bombs cause death the victims attract money very fast but the 3-4 million people who die from diseases are not in our minds . #% It is not good enough ! #% ` Yes ' took courage . #% On environmental liability I tend to take the Commission ' s view that this is best dealt with through horizontal legislation . #% The technical measures which have been pioneered in areas like Scotland must be built on and improved and extended to all areas of fishery . #% I do not see how that particular idea is going to help the reputation of this establishment or make a contribution to activity-based budgeting . #% A year ago they were selling for GBP 60 a head ; this year , GBP 2 a head . #% I think Mrs Junker 's report is excellent because it stresses the key issue , namely that we should be using our money to train , develop and promote women within the developing countries and not necessarily spending all the money on training women within the Commission in Brussels . #% Perhaps the Commissioner would also comment on the cooperation between the Gibraltar authorities and the Spanish authorities . #% While accepting the need for these short-term measures , we must also learn from past mistakes and prepare sensible long-term management proposals to try to deal with these situations . #% However , the report goes on to state that historical rights should be reviewed . #% Our delegation some time ago reached out to investigate a long-term political solution . #% We have amended it in committee and we believe that we have strengthened it . #% The only thing I would say to the assistants is that it may be worthwhile exposing certain Members who are not paying their assistants the proper wages which they should be entitled to receive . #% In my own country , the Scottish Government has made dementia a national priority , and Scottish expertise is being used in research of international significance . #% I believe that the alliance they have formed is an unnatural one . #% I urge all colleagues in this House to show solidarity and demonstrate to the Bulgarians and the Romanians that they do not walk alone . #% I understand it is no longer by catching your eye or by a show of hands but rather that one has to press the button and that the questions are taken strictly in the order in which they are put . #% This problem is particularly prevalent in developing countries where medicines without essential active ingredients are circulating ( in some countries as high as 50 % of the medicines available ) and are being used to treat fatal conditions such as HIV/AIDS , TB and malaria . #% So , should we harmonize all levels of VAT ? #% It seems to me that this proposal provides the ideal opportunity to achieve these two worthwhile ends - the meaningful involvement of experts through RACs , and therefore a greater likelihood that technical measures will be effective and appropriate to a particular fishing zone . #% But in conjunction with the rapporteur , I put forward amendments which were accepted , suggesting that the Commission should seek to incorporate in its negotiations for civil aviation agreements with third countries a commitment to applying the provisions outlined in this regulation . #% There is nothing to stop EU fishing fleets fishing in Papua New Guinea waters and landing their catch and getting their catch canned in Papua New Guinea - and , as has been said earlier , that would be very good for development , and indeed we should encourage it . #% I am extremely grateful , like my colleagues , the other Scottish MEPs , to Commissioner Fischler for agreeing to meet us earlier this evening to discuss these dramatic emergency measures . #% The UK Government claims that this is a distance-selling transaction , like the man-in-black case . #% In Hong Kong we offered to end agricultural export subsidies by 2013 ; our Everything but Arms scheme offers duty-free access for products from the poorest countries . #% The balance between producer interest and consumer interest has been stressed in this debate and is the balance that we have to try and strike . #% These two directives change all that : social and environmental criteria have now been introduced . #% President Prodi spoke - and I have sympathy with much that he said - of the national veto . #% Thus , we can hope to avoid situations where a protectionist regulator can block a takeover by delaying tactics . #% I have read the Council statement , Baroness Ashton 's statement and indeed our own President 's statement . #% 
In relation to renewables , there are many possibilities but very little money is available and very little is being done . #% The two groups are obviously not mutually exclusive , but they make up about a third of the population of the European Union . #% Is not hypocrisy being preached within the Commission when they are saying one thing to the general public about unemployment and about the economy , and yet , in actual practice , they are doing the complete opposite . #% It would be nice if we took back our opinion , Mr Evans , and held it for a further six months . #% The eastern Pacific fleet targets large , mature yellow-fin tuna that swim beneath schools of dolphins , sometimes 20 000 strong . #% Madam President , my point of order is on Rule 22 of the Rules - the duties of the Bureau . #% The situation has not been very clear since October when I wrote to Commissioner Liikanen to ask him to investigate it . #% We can do that with the existing Treaties by use of the passerelle clause . #% All this work will need careful planning and adoption followed by constant monitoring and naturally the Committee on Development and Cooperation feels its members should be closely involved . #% You could have discussed , as proposed by some Member States , the issue of Guantánamo Bay , where EU residents are still kept . #% Mr President , food safety issues have quite rightly dominated much of our thinking and that of Member States in recent years . #% . I voted for this resolution . #% We constantly receive mixed messages on this issue and we need clarity . #% But then the burden of proof lies with the Commission to show us which of Parliament 's proposed amendments would over-protect us against the risk that we see and under-protect against the danger which the Commissioner is anxious to avoid , namely the danger of ` real ' inventions not being adequately patentable within the European Union . #% I agree with the Council that you can not allow the poor people of Ethiopia to suffer for the inadequacies of their government . #% I voted for the compromise amendments on this report and against all others . #% We would like a permanent international criminal court to try those guilty of crimes against humanity and we have called on the Americans to join us in that . #% However , there are other factors at play . #% The second major area of concern is the readiness of the applicant states to live within the disciplines of the single market and respect the European Union 's values . #% The Commission proposal comes in for some criticism from the Budgets Committee in that there is no complete financial statement . #% The international community should also pay particular attention to the plight of children , some of whom face the real danger of being victims twice if they are not given protection from those ever willing to exploit their vulnerability #% However , there is one provision I would highlight and that is the paragraph recognising that the sanctions against the regime in force are not hitting the target and on occasion not being observed at all . #% Thirdly , we must ensure - and I agree with Catherine Bearder who mentioned this - that appropriate funds are available to properly implement this agreement . #% Like Allan Macartney , I firmly believe that bringing the decision-making process closer to those who are most affected by the CFP and are responsible for its implementation would lead to more respect for the provisions of the CFP and for a more successful policy per se . #% It would then be up to the political groups to put forward amendments , which might be similar to those we adopted in October . #% There may be a simple explanation , and this may be due to a little slip-up or mistake in the administration . #% What credibility will it have in the eyes of the our citizens if we deny them the benefits of more choice and lower energy prices ? #% People do not understand either that there are fewer and fewer fish in the sea . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , Madam President-in-Office , Liberals and Democrats wish you well for Lahti . #% Such investments can and should be made by professional banks rather than the little outfit that we have at the moment . #% As other speakers have mentioned , we support the TENs enabling a greater use of public and private partnerships and an imaginative approach to financing such schemes . #% European Liberal Democrats and Reformers welcome the new will to reach agreement on a European Constitution by the June European Council . #% This , lumped on top of the loss of duty-free , will put the ferries out of business and will have a seriously damaging effect on freight to and from Britain . #% It is costing far more in lost business . #% Mr President , this summer 's conflict has claimed the lives of over 1000 people , the vast majority of whom were innocent civilians . #% We see from the situation in Basra just how important that is . #% One can also look at the growth in UK competitiveness and the damage it did to the French and Belgian economies . #% The elderly - senior citizens , or ` grey panthers ' , as they are called in the United States ; ` grey power ' in the UK - represent a very important part of the Community . #% emphasises the need for optimal coordination between an EU disaster response and other EU instruments - particularly common security and defence policy ( CSDP ) civil or military missions and instruments ( i.e. Battlegroups ) . #% The tools to solve these problems are at our disposal in a common foreign and security policy and a justice and home affairs policy , but they lie unemployed . #% These measures are palliative . #% Fiji and Papua New Guinea entered the agreement mainly with the hope of protecting their sugar and tuna industries , which would have suffered greatly under the Generalised System of Preferences . #% I stress the need to build up an enforcement record for prosecutions and convictions against which progress can be measured and call for the unification of jurisprudence in order to ensure a predictable judicial system and public trust . #% Will there not in fact be extra jobs ? #% We would propose an urgent procedure without report . #% Safeguards must , however , be applied and I welcome the proposed general prohibition of the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin , political opinions , religious or philosophical beliefs , party or trade union membership and data concerning health or sex life . #% To look forward it is quite obvious from the statistics that , having had a peak of 37 , 000 cases three years ago and only 3 , 000 cases this year in the United Kingdom , the efforts of the last government and the present one have had a dramatic effect on the reduction of this disease . #% However , there is a glaring inconsistency in Europe 's approach to the maritime industry . #% Let us use the opportunities arising from the review of the CFP to achieve a solution which works . #% I therefore welcome this resolution , which takes a tough line against signs of intolerance in Lithuania and makes it clear that the EU institutions will not sit back and allow Lithuania to pass laws that discriminate against a section of society . #% Mr Lipietz 's report focuses on general competition policy and we are pleased to see that it reflects many of our concerns . #% As Mr McMahon said , the government has promised GBP 9m over three years , but this being on a matched funding basis with the industry , it is now under negotiation . #% In fact , this process took quite a lot longer than originally planned and there would have been sufficient time for the Committee on Industry to have given an opinion . #% These jobs provide a lifeline to so many people living in rural areas . #% The main lesson to learn from BSE and other recent food scares surely is that we must favour a return to natural methods of food production and feeding of livestock . #% In the case of Senegal , we insisted that 60 % of the financial compensation should be for fishing opportunities and 40 % should be for conservation and development . #% The impact of globalisation has positive and negative consequences . #% Mr President , I thank the President-in-Office for her answer to the question . #% The euro zone is by far the most important destination for Scottish exports and source of our imports and tourists . #% However it should not be forgotten - and Mr Lamassoure in his famous remarks about partner regions was not forgetting it - they are also among the ancient nations of Europe which deserve to be taken seriously . #% Surely we can not continue to work in this way . #% Edinburgh and Scotland hosted the G8 Summit this year . #% His funeral was last week and I think that is also important . #% Therefore , although this matter is not going to be brought home at this stage , I would echo the proposition that we must work hard in the near future to get the whole issue of privileges and immunities put on a proper footing as well . #% The UN Security Council debated the issue for the first time last week , underlining the seriousness of the situation . #% Unfortunately not all of them were able to persuade their groups to follow the line . #% 
I believe that tackling climate change and making our agriculture production more sustainable are objectives which must be at the heart of the reform going forward . #% I hope Parliament will support our amendments and I look forward to even greater progress in the years to come . #% However , to do that it must set aside the ethnic differences of the north and south , outlaw the extremes of Sharia law and work together towards economic prosperity . #% To that end , my Group welcomes Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 's determination to restore security and President Abbas 's commitment to dialogue . #% I particularly welcome the call for the Commission to support a sustained information campaign in order to establish an effective prevention policy . #% Mr President , the President-in-Office is quite right that we have to work on IMO relationships if we are going to get a reasonable agreement with other countries , but in fact the main thrust of the Council 's requirements from the Commission following the Prestige accident has been to come forward with new regulations at EU level , which are essentially based on the double hull requirement for all tankers carrying heavy fuel oils . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply . #% 70 % of Europe 's economy and workforce relies on a healthy service sector , a sector being slowly strangled by a mindless mass of regulation . #% The phenomenon we call globalisation is re-shaping our world view , as you say . #% I believe the current offer should at least be maintained . #% Generating power from the desert sun , as a supplement to sources of renewable energy here in Europe , could speed up the process of cutting CO2 emissions at a stroke . #% That has already been tried and it has failed . #% We call it the ` Berlin blockage ' . #% in writing . - I voted for Amendment 1 , which deletes the part-session proposed for week 40 in 2012 . #% Countries which gave up their currencies on the understanding that they would not be expected to pay for the debts of their neighbours have a right to demand more than that . #% European Union aid , both public and private , has been impressive in its generosity . #% It is what I was elected to do and I am sure it is what the vast majority of people in this Parliament were elected to do . #% I believe the Cotonou Accord is the right path . #% However that is to be achieved , it must be with the cooperation of Syria and with the Iranians . #% We have to pull together now as a continent or we will fall apart . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner for clarification of a point in his statement which I believe to be an inaccurate representation of the law as it stands today . #% I would also like to know why a colleague of mine who was trying to exercise his right under Rule 127 was not allowed to speak and why you , Sir , did not vacate the chair under Rule 111 and immediately suspend the sitting until order was restored . #% This secrecy must stop . #% On the matter of compensation , fresh foods , perishable products and even live animals have been delayed for over eight days . #% Your public demands energy security ; it demands a European environment policy ; it demands common action on migration . #% Commissioner , I wonder whether you saw in the press this week -- certainly in the British press -- reports of a plan by a German entrepreneur to start smoking flights from Europe to Asia . #% The author Mark Twain observed , ` We can change the world or ourselves , but the latter is more difficult ' . #% There is a delicate balance to be struck , and I know that in his report the rapporteur has striven towards it . #% I welcome some of the progress that was made at Tampere : for instance , on giving them comparable rights and on the fight against racism and xenophobia . #% There are two points I would like to refer to : one was made by one of the government Ministers to me recently , Gus MacDonald , who admits that but for the wages of all the oil rig workers - of whom very few come from my area - we would be well under 75 % , and I think it is a very unfair situation . #% We need to reassure those who live and work on these vulnerable islands and remote peninsulas that they have nothing to fear from bringing a measure of competition into the process for awarding these contracts . #% For example , I abstained on the call for an end to VAT exemption for air transport because it is not clear if this will help tackle climate change or merely hurt the less well-off traveller . #% After all , as Members , we should lead by example . #% There is a danger that today 's debate will be confused with a debate on Hong Kong tomorrow which reflects concern about the implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law . #% Only through innovation , through re-inventing ourselves , can we be sure that the challenge of demographic change will become tomorrow 's opportunity for growth . #% That fact should not be allowed to obscure what was a very comprehensive piece of work by the Commission , making sense of a 25-year-old document that had undergone multiple revisions . #% They have made millions out of discriminatory sales arrangements . #% Now it is a cornerstone of our European home . #% The stature of this Parliament is growing , and the stature of its Presidency must grow with it . #% The delivery of his speech at 33 r.p.m. was quite exquisite . #% Mr President , research using supernumerary embryonic stem cells is necessary to bring closer the day when adult stem cells can be used therapeutically to cure ` dread diseases ' . #% In particular , however , I voted against those amendments which sought to exclude inland waterways from the legislation , as I feel that there is a difference in liability cover between accidents at sea and those on water such as rivers . #% Until we can get that kind of problem sorted out Europe 's citizens will never believe in the single market . #% Mr Barroso , it is up to you to find out in January whether you have been Father Christmas or Scrooge . #% I am raising this matter today because two new ships are out for tender and it is important that the next competition be based on a level playing field . #% Are there any plans to bring Europol under democratic control ? #% Despite welcoming all of these advancements , I regret the fact that Turkey has not fully addressed the Cyprus issue . #% It is a report that has been drawn up in accordance with the normal procedures of our House and , in recognition of the electoral sensitivities of some , the rapporteur has offered to delete Mr Berlusconi 's name from the report . #% The Kok report on the Lisbon Strategy has also identified `` increasing Europe 's attractiveness for researchers and scientists '' and `` making R [ amp ] D a top priority '' among the policy areas requiring urgent action . #% If it were men getting the implants , there would be a ban tomorrow , but that is not happening because men are not getting them . #% We must be concerned with the remaining conflicts at home , just as we are concerned with conflicts beyond our Union . #% Reform is essential . #% I find it surprising that anybody should be justifying an age limit by the fact that there are too many people applying . #% I am sure this was helped by the positive response we saw from various parts of the world , and especially led by the European Parliament , that decided , against the wishes of many Member State governments to support the United Nations ' isolation of South Africa and to set up a special fund using our budget provisions here . #% This vision must include a democratic voice via a parliament and the involvement of civil society . #% Here we expect you to lead a concerted campaign across the continent . #% Duty-free will still exist for all those travellers outwith the EU . #% Finally , the annual work programme should come to a vote here in Parliament . #% I appeal to other Members to do likewise . #% It will notably support the implementation of the 6th Environment Action Programme . #% Or if the Chancellor is too busy to go that far , at least on the Wittenbergplatz ! #% As well as seeking to inform the general public , the resolution calls on the International Olympic Committee and sports associations , including FIFA , UEFA , the German Football Association and others , as well as sportsmen and sportswomen , to support the ` Red card ' campaign and roundly condemn trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution . #% The proposed Directive aims to update EU measures based on lessons learned from recent epidemic scares and new scientific knowledge on how the disease spreads and risks to human health . #% But here I would appeal for the European Union to take the initiative : to take the initiative on ways forward , to try to bring the Americans back into the international community in this fight against terrorism , and to do so within a proper legal framework , with proper democratic and parliamentary control . #% However , ultimately , I regret to say that the CFP is destined to fail ; and the scrapping of the CFP , coupled with a change in government in Scotland , is the only hope for fishing communities in the long-term future in Scotland . #% Nevertheless , I am concerned that an integrated management system - allowing costs to be allocated to specific work packages and funding sources for operational costs to be identified - was not in place by December 2009 . #% 
This is a false choice . #% The Commissioner told us the disease has cost EUR 170 million in eradication measures . #% I congratulate the Centre for introducing a performance measurement system ( PMS ) in 2009 in respect of its 2009-2011 medium term priorities and its annual work programme , and for having set up a framework of performance indicators to monitor progress and measure output , outcome and impact ; I consider , in particular , that the introduction of a PMS helps the Centre manage and evaluate its impact , efficiency , effectiveness and relevance ; I believe , furthermore , that this system could include further improvements to the activity-based budget and closer monitoring of payment appropriations to avoid carryovers . #% However , when we look at the Lisbon agenda , what comes up time and time again is the economic criteria . #% The measures contained in the report are important both in enhancing maritime safety and in preventing the type of environmental disaster which the Galician coast recently suffered . #% There is indeed a European crisis in research funding . #% The EU has a great story to tell on international development , often considerably more impressive than most Member States . #% I ask the rapporteur : how is a farmer who is only getting two quid a head for his sheep supposed to fit microchips and buy expensive scanners and readers that can comply with a mandatory electronic ID system ? #% However , it makes sure that all the accession treaty additions etc. are incorporated into one document , which is useful . #% Right now only Havana and Pyong Yang operate in such an opaque fashion . #% It emphasises that substantive steps need to be agreed in Cancún to pave the way for the conclusion of a comprehensive international post-2012 agreement in South Africa in 2011 , which should be in line with the latest developments in science and consistent with at least achieving the 2 ºC objective , without prejudice to moving to a 1.5 ºC temperature increase limit in order to safeguard the survival of all nations , peoples and ecosystems . #% There are tremendous possibilities there . #% The Roma feel they are a neglected body within this European Union . #% The deadlines for climate policy are set not by the European Union , nor by the world community : they are set by nature . #% Really , he should be apologizing to this House for misleading it and being economical with the truth . #% The innocent victims of genocide and conflict can not wait for ever to rebuild their lives in order to live in peace in their own villages and in their own homes . #% The biggest problem that small businesses face across the Union is access to capital . #% The EU decision to end direct funding for the democratically-elected Palestinian Authority is likely to have disastrous consequences for the delivery of basic services in cash-strapped Palestine . #% The original Commission proposal was perfectly correct in seeking stakeholder consultation and in seeking economic-impact cost-benefit analysis . #% I will not read them out but you should all look at Amendment No 24 where you will see positive examples . #% Currently the rule is expressed as a percentage of tax , inclusive of the retail selling price , and therefore has little effect on Member States and applicant countries where retail prices are already low . #% Can I first of all congratulate my friend and colleague , Jim Nicholson , on his report . #% They seem to have opted out of that obligation . #% I ask that they be corrected . #% When he is raising the matter with the Commission could he perhaps consult the BBC Scotland programme ` Frontline Scotland ' , which highlighted an amazing cover-up of an incident which occurred some twenty-five to thirty years ago , at which time the then director of the Dounreay installation apparently withheld information not only from the British Government but also from the Commission and the Community inspectorate . #% Many Scottish people have been affected by the Spanish land grab , losing their homes which many have saved a lifetime to afford . #% I was encouraged also to hear that our relationship with the Jordanian Government - which has a key role to play in this issue - is currently good . #% So will the Commission answer my questions if I take one of the third world countries as a model and try to assess how effectual our aid is and what the delegation does ? #% This whole directive was really about cross-border legal aid . #% in writing . - FP7 is a chance for the EU to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions , in particular , by consolidating the European Research Area ( ERA ) . #% The schemes which have been put in place by the European Investment Bank have been extremely good . #% How could the Council endorse such a scheme in June 2002 without proper consultation with the industry and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Council being left out of the picture ? #% I think the strong international market for shark fins , mostly as we have just heard for the Asian shark fin soup market , coupled with the relatively low value of shark meat , has motivated Spain and Portugal to support this drastic amendment . #% It would be a very illiberal doctrine to say that liberalisation should be pursued in an inflexible way , insensitive to local realities . #% in writing . - I support this report which calls for further research to be carried out on electromagnetic fields emitted from devices such as radios , TVs , microwaves , mobile phones and high-voltage power lines . #% In the field of air transport , it is particularly important to have a unified system of air traffic control . #% The prospect of enlargement also requires us to make a success of the Convention . #% In terms of the European budget it is not something we would struggle to find . #% Our leaders must be clear about that at the G20 Summit . #% I call for root and branch reform of the dispute settlement mechanism , which so far enabled private companies to take legal action against countries and sometimes attack their social and environmental law . #% As long as this proposal does not produce extra bureaucracy or impractical demands for those who work around groundwater , then I think this directive is a worthy one . #% Now we must have a complete reassessment of procedures . #% We must work in a cooperative manner with industry , ministers and other organisations to seek a common solution . #% But we should reject any thought of a return to the wide-scale management of the markets we saw in the past . #% The European Union as it currently stands is the biggest safeguard we have against a recurrence of such horrors . #% However , I very much regret that the Nice Treaty makes it necessary for us to have one Commissioner per Member State . #% Only real reform will bring the EU closer to the citizen and it is upon that reform we should concentrate . #% How many weeks must we wait for consensus in the Council , and when we reach consensus , for the courage to carry it through ? #% The issue is who tidies up afterwards - the person who causes it or somebody else ? #% Mr President , I welcome the Commission 's communication and today 's statements . #% If they are in any doubt , Mr Schulz and Mr Rasmussen should read the 1996 directive on the posting of workers . #% The European Parliament has been asked to act urgently and decisively to freeze funds that could be used for terrorists . #% Members of this House are sick at the fine that has been imposed by the European Commission on the CFO . #% The plan is similar to other long-term plans for pelagic fisheries ( such as that recently agreed for the West of Scotland stock of herring ) in that it provides a harvest control rule for exploitation at high long-term yields whilst protecting against the risk of stock collapse . #% We have to ensure that this never happens again . #% Despite the year-long period of reflection -- and eight months into the Commission 's much vaunted plans -- little has been broadcast beyond the bastions of the Berlaymont . #% With your permission again , share fishermen , as I attempted to explain clearly , are self-employed due to the nature of their ownership and operation of their vessels . #% I do not agree with him that we need a tax on currency speculation but certainly we need to avoid this kind of movement . #% Mr President , it is simply that I do not find my name anywhere , despite the fact that I signed in . #% On balance my party has decided that it can not recommend it to the people of Scotland , and accordingly will not be voting for the report . #% However , if the Council is looking for some ambition , then it could do worse than to carefully examine and adopt Mr Wijkman 's report . #% Economic , social and environmental policy do not appear to be addressed in an integrated way . #% Statistics show that around one in three young Europeans has tried an illicit drug and at least one of our citizens dies every hour from a drug overdose . #% According to the Commission , in order to face up to demographic change , Europe should pursue three essential priorities : a return to demographic growth , ensuring a balance between the generations , and ` finding new bridges between the stages of life ' . #% Natural disasters , including climate change , have aggravated the problem . #% On Black Wednesday in September 1992 we saw the immense damage that can be done by great devaluations of currency . #% 
But to make best use of development aid there must be closer cooperation between nation states , financial institutions and the Commission . #% The assembly has played , and continues to play , a key role in monitoring the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) , allowing MEPs to hear first hand the concerns of the ACP parliamentarians and thus contributing to greater European Parliament oversight of the Commission 's negotiations and implementation of EPAs . #% It was not Liberals and Democrats who would not or could not find the compromise that might have put Mr Buttiglione beyond the reach of controversy . #% Unfortunately , an amendment in committee added a reference to the Cunha report and brought with it the concept of quota penalties , a proposal which is against the acquis communautaire . #% I warmly thank Commissioner Fischler for that very direct answer . #% I voted for this resolution which recognises the importance of Russia for Europe , especially in energy relations , but also highlights the need for democratic values and human rights . #% Does a child born in poverty have the human right to receive basic education and appropriate vaccines to protect him from killer diseases ? #% It is neither a time nor a subject for political point-scoring . #% I look forward to a Treaty change that significantly reduces the number of Commissioners . #% Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA . #% But if the centripetal force for our Union is no longer coming from visionary leadership within , it will certainly come from developments beyond our borders . #% All the others , the Prime Ministers past and present , the politicians like David Andrews here today and David Trimble for holding the line when many Unionists panicked . #% I am firmly of the view that this is discriminatory under Article 7 ( 6 ) of the 2001 Renewable Energy Directive and I believe that the Commission must open formal proceedings against the UK for holding us back . #% You could have taken up proposals from this Parliament to establish meaningful , devolved , regional management of fisheries , but instead you promoted toothless advisory councils . #% Mr President , before moving to the election of a President of this House , I should like to ask you to confirm that Annex I of our Rules of Procedure is being abided by . #% But let us also remind everybody that life goes on in the Middle East . #% I can tell Mr Brown that if he watches the way this House votes on this proposal , he will see what we think of his sense of humour . #% The inspectors must be given more time but if Dr Blix reports on 14 February that Iraq has failed to provide answers to his questions , and if the Security Council therefore determines that they are in material breach of the resolution , then the international community has a responsibility to act . #% Commissioner Patten yesterday rightly lamented the inability of the European Union to act fast in situations like this and thus to enjoy the confidence of its Member States and to coordinate the policies of its Member States in an area where a supranational threat requires a supranational response . #% What we urgently need to do in Europe is to cut consumption by motor vehicles and electrical equipment ; cut consumption of heating through better design of buildings ; cut the consumption of electronic equipment ; and increase production of safe , sustainable energy sources - biomass , as proposed by the Commission , and renewables , perhaps through research by moving to a hydrogen economy or looking into nuclear fusion . #% Will members of the public be allowed to attend that meeting as observers or will they be barred from entering the Parliament ? #% And I am surprised that the rapporteur , coming as she does from the south-west of England , believes that Amendment No 11 which reduces the time allowed to Member States to postpone attainment of targets from four to two years and Amendment No 17 which reduces the compliance timetable by three years from eight years to five are practically achievable . #% They are small states but their representation will automatically exceed that of the Basque country , that of Flanders , that of Scotland , that of Wales . #% I also agree that measures must be tailored to different types of fishery . #% Motion for a resolution ( B5-0766 / 2000 ) by Baroness Ludford on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs on the European Union ' s position at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism #% Firstly , as Mr De Rossa has said , at least 150 million of the world 's poorest people regard wildlife as a vital livelihood asset . #% It has been well used by Member States and has generally worked well . #% Mr President , I apologise for being a bit croaky . #% This year , with Bulgaria and Romania in our Union , we can put to rest the ghosts of that period . #% But , whatever the case , there was a lot of confusion and an evident lack of knowledge of the procedures for the evacuation of this building . #% We want it to follow up the very important hearing on forced labour that took place in Brussels with action on the GSP . #% The turmoil in Iraq is proof of what happens when we get the balance wrong . #% This is unacceptable . #% We should get them into Parliament as quickly as possible . #% In today 's world no one country can afford to go it alone . #% In this election in Scotland , there is a debate going about whether there should be full fiscal autonomy for the Scottish parliament : autonomy is growing in all these small countries and it is vital that it be recognised . #% Yesterday I raised the question of Robert Maxwell 's infamous picture in the outside gallery . #% At Cardiff the Commission was criticized for alleging discrimination against football supporters from outside France in the sale of World Cup tickets . #% For effective monitoring and control , there must adequate budgetary and human resources . #% Yet there is something a little strange in talking about the future of Europe when the draft constitution fashioned to facilitate that future languishes in Council . #% In the last major disease outbreak in the UK which you referred to in your speech , foot and mouth erupted and we destroyed a million animals and it cost our taxpayers GBP 4 billion . #% I have two specific questions I should like to put tonight , one to the Council and one to the Commission . #% The action being threatened by the unions does not reflect fairly the mutual respect which exists within the House between the different partners , or indeed the good relations that we have generally enjoyed . #% Our ideas must be followed by action . #% I only need to look at British Rail to see what a disaster that has been . #% I would hope that the Commission would view that debate and this one as two sides of the same coin , when looking to come up with a strategy in this area . #% A broad international coalition must be built and must include Arab countries if we are to convince world opinion that we are not seeking a clash of civilisations . #% The first is the position of non-nationals , the many millions of our fellow human beings not citizens of the Union but either legally resident here or being offered asylum . #% The Liberal Democrats will support this report . #% in writing . - I support this report , which recommends several concrete actions , including the creation of an environmental index , more timely publication of environmental and social data , more accurate reporting on social disparities and extending the system of national accounts to include environmental and social issues . #% I agree with him and I agree with the Commissioner on the need to decriminalise honest fishermen . #% It has failed to conserve stocks , it has failed to sustain our fishing-dependent communities and it has failed to win public support or credibility . #% I would ask the House and you , Mr President , as I know you treat this place with some dignity - much more than I do on occasions - to investigate these matters and perhaps advise us how these practices can be stopped . #% suggests that this cell could be supported by a team , deployable within the first hours of the crisis , could be composed of civilian ( CRT , MIC ) , military and civ-mil ( EUMS , CPCC ) experts and could also benefit from SITCEN and SATCEN intelligence ; #% in writing . - I welcome this report agreeing to release EU funds to assist the victims of flooding in Ireland . #% There just seems to be an ineffectual permissiveness of the situation despite all these wonderful , pious good intentions . #% Dependence on imports is phenomenal and will be even more so by the year 2020 . #% This decision is based on an interpretation of what is written there by the staff sitting on your left-hand side . #% As a delegation from the Norwegian Parliament is here today ... #% We should bear this in mind in assessing the current applicants . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commission proposal which attempts to introduce a degree of liberalization and competition in groundhandling services in airports from 1998 . #% Two or three could be added to this making perhaps twelve to thirteen . #% The Statute and the reform of the expenses are inextricably linked ; they go hand in hand , as Mr Rothley clearly pointed out . #% Therefore I see no reason why we should not go for an exhaustive ballot on this occasion . #% One example given by Amnesty International was the case of Zhang Rongliang , who was the leader of one of the largest house church networks in China . #% I must declare an interest in this debate as I am a beef and sheep farmer in Scotland . #% 
I am very hopeful that they can . #% Why should our democracy be governed by rules laid down by a 19th century Belgian mathematician called D'Hondt ? #% However , we have moved very little towards them . #% Mr President , to pick up on the points that Mrs Lucas has raised , I support the sentiments which she has outlined . #% The impact of industrial fishery must be properly assessed , in terms both of its allowable white fish by-catch , and of its effect on the whole marine food chain . #% Ireland applied for assistance from the European Solidarity Fund following heavy rain which led to severe flooding in November 2009 . #% They are reluctant to invest in new technology because , firstly , they suspect that the investment will not offer sufficient advantage . #% We are there to take the proper measure of those appointed to the Commission or its presidency . #% . I welcome this proposed Directive on measures for the control of avian influenza . #% In fact , a large proportion of older adults live independently , with family or social support . #% The causal link between the fish caught in a given region and the industry it supports within that region can be easily undermined . #% In general terms I find Mrs Smet ' s report and most of the committee ' s amendments wholly acceptable and worthy of support . #% We were assured at the highest level in Paris that this matter was not being driven by protectionism but was being driven purely by science . #% Our dialogue must be extended to cover reform of the United Nations and the role of international law , but the United States must accept that nothing durable can be established without institutions and rules . #% As we discuss this report this evening we should never forget this . #% So there is not a great demand -- to put it mildly -- for new EU legislation specific to inshore fisheries . #% Because they affect people 's health . #% However , the time for debate , in this House at least , is almost over . #% The Scottish Executive has given GBP 50 million , with GBP 40 million for decommissioning and GBP 10 million for the direct socio-economic impact . #% We are committed to 36 % reduction of export refunds over six years and we are nearing the end of that period under our obligations in the GATT Uruguay Round Agreement . #% Commissioner , thank you . #% Our citizens must know that they will receive the same treatment from authorities and enjoy the same rights under the law , whichever country they are in and wherever they are exercising their democratic rights . #% With the oppressive brace of dictatorship ripped away , Iraq has burst like a broken dam . #% I commend these measures to the House . #% I called to the attention of the Chair the fact that my machine did not work . #% For now is not the time for apathy or egocentrism . #% Mr President , I agree with everything that Ms McKenna just said , so I will not repeat it . #% In so doing , it may finally turn on its head the old Anglo-Saxon misconception about the intellect of England 's Celtic neighbours . #% Mr President , with great respect to Mr Alyssandrakis , I have to differ with him . #% Mr President-in-Office , do you accept that this is a new and profoundly oppressive instance of the subordination of women and their seclusion into private life ? #% I also commend Anca Boagiu and Meglena Kuneva and their predecessors as Ministers for EU Integration for their unstinting hard work . #% I hope that the Commission will be able to report back to Parliament on how far the Member States have gone in implementing this reclassification , and will continue to monitor the issue of silicone-gel breast implants , always putting patient safety first . #% What we have also got to look at is the economic consequences and there are a number of unanswered questions here , too . #% I would remind you that the point Mr Herman was making during yesterday 's session was exactly the same point Mrs Randzio-Plath was suggesting in an oral amendment . #% We want the Council under this presidency later this month to take a whole range of initiatives to isolate Burma . #% At the end of this month there is the World No Tobacco Day . #% Of course price is important . #% Otherwise there is a danger that dominant media players can restrict access to information and thereby move public opinion . #% Our approach , which is based on controlling the supply of drugs , is using up massive resources . #% But recently we had another one by this New Labour , with the sell-out on the Fraga report . #% The Convention 's extension of codecision to budgetary powers would have made the European Union more accountable and transparent . #% Trade and investment have changed our economic perspectives and vastly increased our wealth . #% So after a short post-mortem , the IGC must resume and must conclude its work under the Irish presidency . #% Madam President , I welcome Mr Corrie ' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year . #% It also advocates gradual and reciprocal liberalisation of trade . #% I sought to amend the report to make sure that the conditions of production play a full part in the notion of Fair Trade through the need to respect the eight core ILO conventions . #% I am pleased that a possible deadline of 2010 has been set for the ratification by Member States , as the European Community is not a party to the ILO or this convention and it is important that each Member State ratifies the ILO recommendations . #% Is this too little too late ? #% At your press conference after the summit , President-in-Office , you said that but for the IGC , your presidency would be remembered as ` the most glorious of recent years ' . #% Madam President , I should like it to be recorded just how good Mrs Banotti 's hair is looking . #% Lastly , I demand that the Commission this morning tell us clearly that there are no circumstances and nor will there be any in which it will seek to frame legislation that avoids the need to consult the European Parliament and avoids the need to observe the wishes of the Environment Council . #% ` While Europe 's eye is fixed on mighty things , #% I therefore support the view that the Round be concluded as a single undertaking with results being considered globally . #% I wish to raise in particular the cases of China and Taiwan . #% Unless we emphasize the social and regional aspects , however , the positive advantages of the information society may be lost to us all . #% In conclusion , I owe to an American poet , Ralph Waldo Emerson , the thought that there is no such thing as history , only biography . #% It is not surprising , therefore , that these refugee camps are breeding grounds for disease , discontent and disorder . #% So it is historic and I would like to start on a pleasant note by throwing a few bouquets at the President-in-Office , which might surprise him . #% It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread . #% The Union will soon have new legislation on procedural safeguards and the rights of defendants , and we remind the Council that those rights are non-negotiable . #% in writing . - I welcome this report , which integrates Croatia into the fight against drugs in the EU . #% Does the presidency recognise the legitimacy of the European Parliament or is it somehow running scared of our participation ? #% I watched two strong men lifting 50-kg bags on to women ' s backs and saw them stagger off to their plastic shelters kilometres away . #% I suspect that the cost of moving to a free market would be much lower than we imagine but , of course , once the psychology of restricted markets has taken hold it is hard to get over that . #% Turning now to the amendments which have been tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism , the Socialist Group will be supporting all the amendments with the exception of Amendment No 16 . #% Increased coherence between trade , labour , environmental , animal welfare and other internationally accepted regulations and principles of ` corporate governance ' through improved cooperation between the WTO , the ILO , the United Nations , the Multilateral Environment Agreements and other international institutions must be mandatory . #% 
Furthermore , with an increase of just 1.04 % of women 's participation in the labour market , the additional costs of extending maternity leave would be covered . #% I am also concerned from a Scottish dimension . #% One fundamental question which occurred to me when I read the report is : how did it happen that computer designers and software designers were allowed to make and programme machines in such a way ? #% The Commission has a lot to answer for in this , but the main appeal that I make at this stage is not for recrimination but for the proposal to be reconsidered . #% The UN needs USD 550 million to be able to do a decent job and it has just USD 135 million . #% She did argue again for a more protracted period of reform , but as we said , if we spin it out longer and longer it impacts upon the morale of the staff and that impacts on the performance of the staff . #% We will cut them off . #% Perhaps you could convey the regret and apologies of Members who will not be present . #% We will never know how many East Timorese died as a result of his refusal to cancel this contract at an earlier stage . #% If supported unamended , this report will unjustly discriminate against northern countries and their historic fishing rights and jeopardise relative stability . #% Clearly , simplification and stripping out the bureaucracy from the CAP is a key objective of the next reform , because certainly back in Scotland , many farmers are frustrated and angry about the bureaucracy and the disproportionate nature of the penalty system . #% There is no reason why the United States should not retain command of a multinational UN force in Iraq , but it must be based on a UN resolution and give the UN and contributing nations the central role in decision-making . #% The Commission says that it wants from that a new way of doing things , a better way of doing things , involving stakeholders more , using a multi-annual , multi-species ecosystem approach to management . #% It simply suggests that , in future , an MEP 's salary should be a percentage of a judge at the Court of Justice 's salary but does not mention what that percentage should be ; and , thirdly , it states that the percentage should be set by common accord between this Parliament and the Council , so Parliament would not be able to act unilaterally to set its own salary . #% It is perhaps better to have no agreement and to re-think both how we raise money and how we spend it , than to reach agreement at any cost . #% We must ensure that in future when we identify the need for urgent aid to the fisheries sector , it is delivered in a way that is both fairly targeted and quickly completed . #% We have come up with some fairly useful conclusions on the issue . #% That is the road of 21st century economic colonialism and it is the wrong way forward for Africa . #% Can we move forward and consolidate this unprecedented era of peace , stability and prosperity , or will it melt before our eyes and be replaced by a new national rivalry and brinkmanship ? #% President-in-Office , if the Luxembourg presidency has failed your expectations , I hope you will not blame yourself . #% Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984 , then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland . #% You can not equate a candidate for office with a holder of office . #% Information to patients from the industry varies from excellent approaches and partnership with patients to situations where some patient organisations are being accused of being mere fronts for the industry . #% My direct question to the Commission is : how would this new situation change , i.e. that of unlimited liability ? #% This problem has to be examined and the appropriate steps taken to rectify it . #% The CFP review provides a challenge and an opportunity . #% These two directives are a step forward -- not a huge step , as Mrs Schörling said , but at least some progress has been made . #% Against this background , I am appalled and disappointed that this report threatens an increase in shark finning . #% As the EU and the European Parliament 's very foundations are based on shared values , of which non-discrimination is a key element , then it is our duty to voice concern where we see these values being violated and these rights denied to others in third countries . #% I call on the Commission to think again too when it comes to open access to the North Sea as part of a future CFP . #% The problem is that at present Members of this House undervalue Question Time . #% I hope the Commission will heed the committee 's amendment calling for Community funding which is not dependent on cofinancing to compensate fishermen under these plans . #% I hope that the future budget of the EU will provide adequately for rural development programmes , and that the UK and Scottish Governments will enable the full potential benefits to be realised . #% No matter how good an agreement is on paper , without the resources to carry it out , it is a meaningless piece of paper . #% We should make a much more consistent effort to develop a dialogue with the oil supplier countries , with the Middle East , with Russia , with the Caspian and Caucasus countries and with West Africa . #% Ten weeks later it is only this week that we have received a plan to deal with the problem . #% I think that is a sensible safety valve . #% Many people in Scotland 's fisheries-dependent communities are totally disillusioned with the European Union 's management of fisheries ; so much so that , today , the Scottish Parliament 's European Committee considered a petition based on 250 000 signatures calling for withdrawal from the CFP . #% If ever we were looking for ways to assist job creation , this would be an area that we should be considering . #% The review is an opportunity not only rectify shortcomings but also to preserve crucial provisions which are worthwhile and necessary for the survival of Europe 's fragile fisheries-dependent communities . #% We are also agreed , particularly in respect of the arrest warrant , that it makes the adoption of common and high minimum standards a matter of urgency . #% On the controversial issue of free movement of persons , I urge all Member States to follow the lead of Denmark , Sweden , Ireland and the Netherlands , which have said they will apply no restrictions to free movement . #% Some complain there are too many foreigners aboard , others that the new French and German specifications for the engines have weakened it . #% Amendment No 9 allows each Member State to introduce more favourable provisions than those set down in the directives , and insists that these new rules will not lower current standards of protection . #% You purported to have reached an absolute decision on this . #% For this reason , we stress the absolute necessity of education , of clear and straightforward information and of strict regulatory control of those who sell and distribute such products . #% Progress in this area will require radical changes and investment decisions and behaviour by governments and individual households . #% Firstly , I would like to congratulate Mrs Leperre-Verrier on another excellent report . #% Mr President , the history of a civilized society is the story of a succession of battles against repression and discrimination . #% It seeks a fresh breeze to lift its sails . #% We have to modernise social protection and benefit systems to face the challenges of a global market . #% For example , her last comment about a reserve and keeping money back from those who do not execute it well and giving it to those who implement Community policy well , is a measure which the Commission should give serious consideration to adopting . #% We should insist that Mr Cook is brought before this House to provide us with an explanation on his extraordinary collaboration with the oppressive Indonesian regime . #% I regret however , that at no time did he give any consideration to the consumer or the user of the service . #% I want to say today how much I enjoyed the support and the great help of the rapporteur and the Chairman of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee . #% I note , however that , in addition to Mr Verhofstadt 's planned visit to Rome , there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers on Thursday of this week . #% But , for too long , these have been discouraged by negative and sceptical attitudes in government and political circles , public opinion and the media , by unsympathetic fiscal regimes , by a risk-averse culture and cumbersome legal structures . #% The EPLP does not , however , support the inclusion of GMOs in this directive as , firstly , we believe it is the wrong directive and , secondly , there is existing legislation on this topic and this could give rise to confusion among potential operators as to which legislation is applicable . #% We see that the junior doctors are , in fact , going to get a great benefit from this extension to the directive . #% I would make a plea to the Commission this evening to reach an early agreement with the Council on the setting-up of this European Civil Aviation Safety Agency to ensure that safety both in Europe and worldwide is secured . #% This means we need to honour our Doha commitments to ` less-than-full reciprocity ' in NAMA , to special and differential treatment and Aid for Trade for the poorest countries . #% We can not afford to hobble our economies , our industries and those who live and work in our rural and remoter regions . #% Few people in this Parliament will have any appreciation of the enormous amount of material that this temporary committee has looked at in detail over the last few months and great praise must be given to rapporteur Böge and the chairman for the way in which they have handled it . #% Should Mr Barón Crespo 's proposal not have the effect of moving the report on terrorism then I would be very happy to support it . #% Mr President , I wish to thank the general rapporteur and the lead committee for their work on this important proposal . #% But while this debate focuses on raw materials or ingredients of foodstuffs , it does not cover the origin of the final product . #% 
Indeed , the whole political system in the European Union was made to look ridiculous at that time . #% But Amendment No 3 is the crux of the debate : the movers say that the European Union should not proceed without the guarantee of adequate standards in procedural law . #% Mr President , I should like to begin with a confession . #% Subsidiarity does not stop at the front door of the Member States : it goes right down to the territorial entities within the Member States , to the local authorities within the Member States , and that is of critical importance to us all . #% The rest are all add-ons to ensure that we have a profitable farming sector to be able to deliver the environmental benefits , to tackle climate change and all the other things we set out in the report . #% But we must remember that public funds will not be well spent unless they are spent on people who have the drive of curiosity and the commitment to knowledge for its own sake . #% Of course we must bring the People 's Republic in too - as soon as certain basic conditions have been met . #% The lessons from last week 's Rome Conference in which the Commissioner , the Italian President-in-Office and myself took part are there to be learned . #% Madam President , could you point out to the new colleague that this is a European Parliament and if he wants to continue with his narrow nationalist views maybe he should have been elected to the Scottish Parliament ? #% That is why I welcome this Council regulation on rehabilitation and reconstruction and I congratulate Mrs Baldi and Mr Andrews on the work they have done in the Committee on Development and Cooperation . #% I wish to begin by congratulating you on the state-of-the-European-Parliament address , which perhaps , like other state-of-the-Union addresses , should become an annual event . #% Scotland , politically , is in a disadvantaged position at this moment , with our national interests being represented from London . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , after 9/11 Le Monde announced : ` Nous sommes tous Américains ' . #% However , participation is a privilege , not a right . #% The AIDCP has established two systems : the tuna tracking and verification system , and the dolphin-safe certification system . #% This House is the manifestation of the belief that we are better than our histories and more than our nationalities and it must be manifest in its President . #% The Wall Street Journal came to the conclusion that the shift by Mr Bush to declare these steel tariffs in March , followed by his agricultural subsidies and his protectionism on timber with Canada , was the turning-point from being a free-trade regime to a protectionist , America-first regime . #% in writing . - A project on the scale of the Nordstream gas pipeline requires full and thorough examination of the environmental implications involved . #% In the early period of building the European Union , political leaders were ahead of public opinion . #% In their own backyard the Commission are openly practising this job for life approach and , if you do not get on the bottom rung of the ladder then there really is a block on you . #% As a representative of the Scottish National Party , I was also very conscious that many small countries , which only recently re-established their independence , were among those we voted in today . #% I believe continued application of EU pressure will help to deliver a long-term solution . #% That would go a long way to make the public feel that this was their currency . #% One of the things that the report and its explanatory statement do is to show exactly to what extent there is a basis . #% It is imperative that an adequate and non discriminatory education is provided to all children of travelling communities regardless of the Member State in which they temporarily reside . #% Climate change is one of the fundamental challenges facing us today and it is vital that we reduce carbon emissions across Europe to help meet this challenge . #% I believe the agency has a vital role to play in ensuring that new drugs get to the market safely and with the minimum duplication of effort on the part of individual Member States . #% On the contrary , we would support an approach that clearly exempts from the prior notification requirement the kinds of local services that do not affect the development of trade , and do not conflict with the interests of the European Union . #% I wish Ireland success in its presidency and look forward to the day when an independent Scotland takes its rightful place in the world -- better off independent ! #% Many of these craft are old and are becoming increasingly unsafe , so we need to look at the modernisation of these vessels on health and safety grounds alone . #% We must have action and we must have action decisively and urgently . #% The amendments which I put forward seek to restrict the list of crimes defined as terrorist crimes and covered by the European arrest warrant to the most serious cross-border criminal offences , and if I may quote Amendment No 16 , it specifies those crimes `` which aim to destroy the fundamental freedoms , democracy , respect for human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law on which our societies are based '' . #% I am a little sceptical sometimes of European foundations in European institutes and I have visited a few in my time . #% The health and safety of those who work at the coalface of construction should always be remembered and it is important to have acknowledgement of this in the report . #% We supported Amendment 78 , since it is pro-generic in principle . #% These would have made it a requirement of the approval mechanism to consider whether significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments had been achieved . #% The same thing happened with freedom of movement : the Commission went very half-heartedly on this issue . #% Nowadays it is very difficult to sustain small towns . #% Mr President , there can be few subjects closer to a Scotsman 's heart than money and , as the only Scots representative on the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives , I have watched the often Kafkaesque debates with much interest -- even when the real debate appears to be happening elsewhere . #% How can the Council take such decisions , either budgetarily or from a policy point of view ? #% The challenge of dealing with a hole in the ozone layer , melting ice caps , rising sea levels and climate change . #% Exposed as you are on Europe 's southern and eastern flanks , you see the importance of understanding a little more and condemning a little less . #% There is a reference in the resolution which I completely support which asks the Council presidency to urge Member States to refrain from individual initiatives and , instead , to work through appropriate European Union mechanisms . #% Our own disability intergroup has been campaigning on it for a long time and so has the European Disability Movement . #% Does the Commission consider that this proposal is , firstly , consistent with civil rights , as enunciated for the Community , and , secondly , in the interests of the development of Internet use in the European Union , as rhetorically advocated by everyone , including in particular the British Prime Minister ? #% The NGOs ' workers often live in appalling conditions in fear of their lives , and yet by their work in the medical and social fields they are responsible for saving millions of lives . #% In the absence of UN legitimacy and moral authority there is a duty on the countries prosecuting this war to do so in a way that is consistent with international norms and conventions . #% The social and economic pain being felt by families in Scotland 's coastal communities is very real . #% We will support a single market in services if you protect proper public provision and if you heed our concerns for personal freedom we will tackle terrorism together with the Council . #% This measure will require companies to give energy consumers accurate information to allow them to regulate consumption , compare their consumption with a normal user in a similar building and in an ecologically efficient building , and assess the environmental impact of , for example , the CO2 emission levels of the energy they consume . #% Patents must be excluded , and the point about the commercial scale must be extended to the whole of the directive , not just to some parts of it . #% I wonder if you would care to comment on the use of the Euro by international companies in the European Union . #% Recent events have reminded us that questions of immunity are not mere matters of form , but go to the substance of great issues of democracy in Europe and you have , indeed , alluded to that yourself . #% For once we would be making a difference . #% These need not be billed purely as economic policy summits ; the demands of energy security , of peace in the Middle-East and of fighting internationally organised crime are equally urgent and should be on next week 's agenda . #% Naturally , in our group , we want to see that the achievement of the internal market involves a balance - as you said yourself , Commissioner - between market freedom and the need to protect the environment , consumer health and consumer confidence . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report which will provide funding for personalised measures to help workers who have been made redundant in Poland . #% Many of our citizens think that disability issues have been resolved because legislation in many of our countries has been in place for years . #% They are not the same and therefore should not be voted as identical amendments . #% Europe is a community of freedom , responsibilities and democratic values . #% For the ELDR Group there is a clear case to look again at this issue . #% However , while these measures will hopefully contribute to improving the state of fishery resources , I am concerned that the Commission has not got it right in certain other areas : for example , in the recent report on the implementation of MAGPs and the drastic cuts that it calls for in some fleets which is of grave concern to Scots and other fishermen . #% We also know that they have a very low reproductive capacity , and that there are around 87 different species of fish swimming together at these great depths , of which only around eight are edible or marketable . #% Therefore , I trust , Mr President , that your successors will engage with all Members of this House in a debate about the organisation of Parliament 's affairs in order to preserve and develop the values which you have upheld so courageously in your term as President . #% Or linking the Lisbon and Gothenburg Agendas through full unbundling and cuts in CO2 ? #% They should be discussed within the appropriate forum where engineers , technicians , scientists etc. , or whatever technical group , would look at these specifications rather than coming to me . #% 
As things stand the new legislation is full of loopholes and exemptions and my concern is that this will allow the use of toxic chemicals in manufacturing to continue , even when safer alternatives exist . #% I would also suggest to him that this is not an attack on the nuclear installation programme , it is a question of health and safety which , as he quite rightly pointed out , is uppermost in the minds of the Council and of Members of this Parliament . #% Put the ` is on ' back into ` Lisbon ' - the need to consolidate public finances , the commitment to financial discipline and debt management , the drive to complete and strengthen the single market . #% These millions of Muslims , from Indonesia to Nigeria , from Central Asia to the leafy suburbs of California , knew nothing about Osama bin Laden before 11 September . #% It they do not , I recommend all Members to reject Mr Prodi in May as a sign of objection to this situation . #% I want to give an explanation of vote on behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party as to why it abstained on the amended proposal and then voted for the legislative resolution . #% That is a matter of intense debate . #% This is an important victory which will benefit consumers , who will be able to enjoy cheaper roaming costs by this summer . #% That is why I welcome the Commission 's recent communication on integrating migration issues into the Union 's external relations policy . #% It seems to me pointless that we try to achieve a reduction in over-fishing as a core policy objective on the one hand , while continuing to facilitate cheating at the taxpayer 's expense on the other . #% Liberals and Democrats in this House want a Commission that is at least one-third women . #% in writing . - I welcome this resolution , which emphasises the interdependence of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and points out that access to water is a human right . #% Mr President , I regret that the peace process has not moved on and I recognize the frustration and the erosion of confidence that has taken place . #% I know what I want this Parliament and the Commission to say . #% Mr President , on behalf of my group I should like to say I was disappointed to see that Amendment 6 from the Committee went through . #% It is essential that , given the absence of full recognition of any EU representative bloc , with delegatory powers agreed by Member States , individual EU Member States continue to represent themselves inside the IMF . #% I am pleased that the EU has responded swiftly with EUR 196 million so far in assistance . #% What is most important to the health of a society is the direction in which its face is set . #% The challenge laid down by the European Parliament is to the European Commission to change its mind and accept our amended proposal , and to the Council of Ministers to follow the strong lead which we have given in this matter . #% Congratulations to the Austrians for avoiding a row . #% Well , in this case , the culprit was national interest , which watered down , or rendered indecipherable , policies and practices that are in all of our interests . #% Mr Christodoulou has not been simplistic ; he has spelled out the financial difficulties . #% It seeks to approximate laws with common minimum penalties . #% The impact of industrial fisheries also requires a thorough investigation . #% The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provides an appropriate legal basis to draw up and implement Community action in the field of sport . #% It is outrageous that this organisation now holds the international tuna industry to ransom , threatening to blacklist on their website any supermarkets that refuse to sell cans of tuna carrying their dolphin-safe labels . #% I am in favour of the promotion of renewable energy through the production of crops . #% in writing . - I strongly support this resolution which demands that all the provisions of Directive 1999/74/EC on the welfare of laying hens be fully implemented by all Member States by the deadline of 1 January 2012 . #% You told us that you wanted to put Europe at the service of the people of Europe . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report and being brave enough to highlight such issues as corruption and the lack of pluralism in some States . #% That is surely an unjustified calumny on an honourable profession . #% in writing . - I welcome my colleague Harlem Desir 's report on corporate social responsibility . #% I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his excellent report and the way in which he presented it today . #% I welcome it because it spreads education throughout the European Union and connects it to the incoming states . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the Ouský report in order that decisions taken regarding the movement of pets be taken only after full consideration of the scientific assessments . #% It is a door to a better future on an island that has endured too much for too long . #% I should just finish by saying that I hope the Commissioner understands this and that DG VI will therefore be fully involved in all the negotiations that he is going to be undertaking . #% It is not for us to tell Azerbaijan , Georgia or Armenia how to run their affairs , but with the benefit of our experience we can reach out to a region that is looking to the EU for help , inspiration and perhaps even leadership . #% But history should teach us not to be an instrument in supporting authoritarian regimes . #% They might perish and compensation must be paid . #% Therefore we can do nothing other than regret the decision of the Republic of Korea 's Constitutional Court that the death penalty is not a violation of that country 's Constitution . #% I extend my solidarity and sympathy to all those families who have been bereaved of loved ones over the years as a result of the violence . #% With goodwill on both sides it could be a first step away from years of partition . #% We are at least as well-placed as the Commission to engage in that dialogue with the citizens . #% I should like to add one caveat , however . #% For lenders , a more integrated market would offer greater economies of scale , reduce costs and lower rates for the borrower . #% I have fought for what I believe to be right , and I have done that , sometimes , against the interests of my own political group and sometimes even against the interests of my own country . #% The campaign emphasises that violence , whether it be for social , cultural or economic reasons , is unacceptable and should be treated as such by local authorities , social workers and the police . #% Your Commission launched the Lisbon Agenda and inaugurated the euro . #% With the lack of proper arrangements in many other reactors - because Chernobyl was only the fifth worst - we are going to have another disaster and the EU will have a great deal of responsibility . #% It was then , and remains today , the predominant interest of local government to protect its right to local self-government . #% We look forward to working closely with you . #% I , therefore , am afraid I have to oppose Mr Baldarelli 's proposal because the interests of Parliament are greater than the issue itself . #% The key to all successful presidencies is leadership . #% It is not going to do any good to think we can rewrite the Nice Treaty for Croatia . #% We should be focusing policy-making on areas where EU-wide action is indispensable . #% I regret that amendments tabled by my Group were not adopted . #% I am convinced such a debate would reveal that the vast majority of Pakistanis reject extremism and fundamentalism and wish to live in a country at peace with itself , at peace with it 's neighbours and on good terms with the West . #% I welcome , in addition , the agency 's annual procurement plan for 2009 which greatly helped Eurojust 's units and services in the management of their tenders . #% The Trade Committee believes that we need to bring more visibility to aid for trade , that we need to make it easier to mobilise aid for trade and that we need to send the right signal in advance of the WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in Hong Kong in December that we take aid for trade seriously . #% While we are right to call on Hamas to recognise Israel and end terrorism , we should not bring into question the outcome of fair and free democratic elections . #% Madam President , I agree with what Mrs Fontaine and Mr Pasty have said but I should like to broaden the matter rather than narrow it down . #% in writing . - I welcome the general thrust of the Schmidt report . #% In order to secure what we all want , sustainable fisheries , then surely fishing effort must be made to correspond to available resources . #% However , the strict regime of TACs and quotas has itself exacerbated the problem of discards , with over 25 % of healthy fish being thrown dead back into the sea every year . #% I look around this room and see that most of us are probably approaching middle age . #% 
The report 's emphasis on the key role played by schools is to be welcomed , as is the call for action to be taken to address the alarming decline in the nutritional value of fruit and vegetables . #% If the Commissioner or any one has any doubt why there is an urgent need to so , I would simply remind colleagues about the Lockerbie disaster . #% But we have to take this step at the moment to ensure the continuation of preferences for the two largest countries in the Pacific region . #% Those agendas include our agenda to consolidate citizens ' rights within the Union and our agenda of anti-discrimination . #% What we need here are practical measures instead of lip service , for people to be able to start enterprises . #% You have seen the European Union grow from 9 countries in the 1970s to 12 in the 1980s , 15 in the 1990s , 25 and then 27 in this decade , with a queue of countries waiting to join . #% I am convinced that some jobs have been lost because waiting for the decision on state aid has meant that a company has gone out of business in the end because it did not have the approval in time . #% Madam President , I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the name of my group . #% On land registers , the report favours improving access to standardised information , as well as supporting further work on the European Land Information Service . #% These are the southern agreements with third countries which enable EU vessels to fish in the waters of Morocco , Mauritania , Argentina and elsewhere . #% Mr Mugabe can not and will not be remembered in Africa unless he gives his countrymen a chance to breathe , walk without fear and seek opportunities to enhance their quality of life . #% But it is also an industry which requires , as Mr Ó Neachtain said earlier , to adhere to the strictest standards of compliance with best practice in the fields of the environment , welfare , health and food safety , particularly if consumer confidence in its products is to be increased . #% On the percentage allocated to the United Kingdom , would he not agree that it would seem fairer to give a higher percentage to the country whose market and whose consumer confidence in that market has been most seriously damaged ? #% I welcome the words from the President-in-Office of the Council about closer involvement of Parliament in the process of passing such legislation . #% Once they cross the line in Copenhagen , they will have little time to celebrate , the training for the next marathon begins - the marathon of meeting the acquis communautaire and achieving democratic endorsement of the enlargement process . #% in writing . - I supported the Vălean report on EU citizens ' rights . #% It is no surprise , therefore , that the Commission has focused on this area as it shifts its attention to retail financial services . #% We are going to give fishing opportunities for ten vessels fishing for 1000 tonnes per year of deepwater shrimp - and an additional 535 tonne by-catch - 35 freezer tuna seiners and 14 surface longliners fishing for 8000 tonnes of tuna . #% This proposal will introduce a cash minimum amount of cigarette duty . #% If the directive is being breached , do they have an action which can be taken before the Court of Justice ? #% These are important points although they are not controversial among us . #% Now the scientists agree that there are an estimated 400 000 tonnes of haddock spawning stock biomass in the North Sea . #% In particular , I am pleased that the report contains concrete suggestions for actions to be taken by the Commission , most notably by increasing dialogue with local authorities on development aid , improving decentralisation of aid delivery and supporting structured dialogue between local authorities in the developing world and the EU . #% I note the point she makes about a pre-accession programme which could have been a useful idea . #% There are 1200 independent meat inspectors in the United Kingdom and I hope they will be able to continue the work that reassures us as consumers that the meat we eat is safe . #% Let us work to close the back door to illegal immigration more effectively by offering legal opportunities to those wishing to settle here and integrating them properly in our society . #% Egypt is a valued partner of the EU and this House in the Middle East peace process , an ally in so much and a partner in development , but we must acknowledge that Egypt does not meet our standards . #% If the proceedings of this House had been heeded fourteen years ago the ideas put forward by our former Danish colleague , Niels Haagerup , might have held sway . #% My own group would have felt happier if there had been somewhat stronger protections for privacy as well as somewhat stronger data protection elements . #% A two-state Palestine is emerging , riddled by violence , sectarianism and fear , while a two-state solution to the conflict is moving further away . #% I also believe that it is appropriate that we do something to try and encourage the future of veal production and that we should do something to encourage the consumer to recognize that veal will be produced in a healthy and wholesome way , without infringing animal welfare issues . #% The only way to go on this is ` Not Proven ' . #% Every year 1.4 billion passengers fly on an international trip . #% I will be sticking to my recommendation that you , Mr President , invite a Non-Inscrit to attend the Conference of Presidents . #% Is this a concern that the Commission does not share any more or is it , like Mr Skinner , more interested in the freedom of goods than the freedom of people ? #% The report also places the discards issue in the broader context of the problem of by-catches of seabirds and of sharks and it calls for a significant range of pilot discard projects with a geographical spread . #% The BBC recently produced evidence that ` wombs ' , as they described it , were for sale in Romania - that women were being paid to have children for export to Member States of the European Union . #% What assurance can the Commissioner give me tonight that areas like these , where they have benefited substantially from a programme tailor-made to defence-industry job cuts and training schemes to help those people who have lost their jobs through the peace dividend , will continue to benefit to the same extent as at the moment ? #% I welcome the Justice and Home Affairs Council 's agreement at the weekend on a framework decision on combating terrorism . #% In fact , the situation that happened many years ago to which Mr Bowe referred involved the butchers my family used in Wishaw in Scotland . #% I agree that the report should promote research to make batteries less environmentally harmful and to encourage the development of new recycling technologies and that a 50 % recycling target should be set for non-hazardous batteries . #% This evidence should involve fishermen as well as scientists . #% Mr President , on behalf of my Group I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for his willingness over the past five years to engage in debate with this House wearing a tie with a very light tinge of blue . #% We have to take some things on trust , but I would be reluctant to take all on trust . #% in writing . - I support this report which demands responsible and clear rules for Subcontracting in Europe . #% Amendment No 5 was concerned with the more technical matter of water basins . #% We understood the report was being deferred until the second December sitting in Strasbourg , and so we did not have the opportunity to discuss it . #% The provisions in this Treaty for incorporating it into the EU law-making process are inadequate . #% But use your public tour of Europe , together with Mr Barroso , to get agreement in national capitals for the financing the Union needs . #% Therefore , that is why we should emphasize this . #% To those Members who intend to convey to Saddam Hussein the message that impunity in exile is an acceptable way out , I say , to borrow the phrase of the anti-war coalition : not in our name . #% That can be a dangerous strategy , but far less dangerous than being in the position -- as you pointed out , Commissioner -- of being behind public opinion . #% It was salutary to note that Commissioner Fischler himself saw the need to call upon the Member States to live up to their responsibilities and apply for aid from the fisheries budget . #% On 9 December of last year , the Environment Council followed our lead and demanded full implementation by the Commission . #% That is a role that the EU could usefully play - of bringing the Indians , Pakistanis or Bangladeshis , etc. together in that sub-continent to discuss their common problems and , in a sense , act as an external honest broker in dealings between the countries in that sub-region . #% At the same time they will be seeking derogations from the EU to enable them to produce pork to welfare and hygiene standards that would be considered illegal under current EU law . #% But there is also a burgeoning growth of the inland aquaculture industry which is enabling exciting progress to be made in the farming of cod , halibut , turbot and a host of other key species . #% However , it must build on its recent reforms and ensure that full democracy , respect for human rights and the rights of minorities become the norm in Turkey . #% author . - Mr President , while we sit in this Chamber having grand debates , the hangmen in Iran are working overtime . #% It is in this area that we in Europe could help by increasing our support to strengthen procedures . #% I oppose penalties , and our group will be voting against the idea of penalties , which would only have to be paid by the airports anyway , and on the dates for implementation we support the original Commission proposal . #% But we no longer have direct links , as we used to have in Scotland , with the Low Countries , Scandinavia and the Hanseatic ports . #% India signed up to the Millennium Development Goals and the EU , with our cooperation , should help by facilitating universal education , Eurohealth programmes and policies to get young people from poor areas into work . #% I think the Chinese have now learned a lesson : they are going to have to reafforest , take care of the hydraulic system which coped with the floods for hundreds of years and try to protect the environment instead of raping it , as the Chinese regime has done over the past 40 years . #% While nobody would deny that we need to move away from fossil fuels , the knock-on effects of major shifts in production to monocultivation of ( often GM ) biofuels could have long-term effects that are even more detrimental , and this report does well to keep this issue on our agenda . #% In relation to country or Member State of origin , could I ask Commissioner Fischler to clarify whether , apart from the compulsory information that we are discussing here , information regarding the area of origin , such as Scotland or the Orkney Islands for example , can be displayed prominently on a voluntary basis ? #% 
Mr President , this is a very acceptable suggestion , but there is a risk that , yet again , the Members ' general opportunity to question the Commission at question time will be curtailed . #% Madam President , I wished to indicate that I was going to participate in that vote . #% The practice of charging different fares for different flights , depending on which country you start your journey in , is a widespread practice within the European Union airline industry . #% The insistence by some Member States on one per cent of GNI would deprive us of the Lisbon investment , as indeed your final proposal might have done . #% And we voted against it because we think it is bad for the developing world . #% We must make sure that this information society makes it possible for people to be in control of information rather than information controlling the people . #% EUR 98 million is not an insignificant sum of money in South African terms . #% While this report had some negative elements , such as its call for a delay of the Trade Defence Instrument Review and the unprecise nature of the language on liberalisation ( which has opened up the possibility that certain aspects of liberalisation may be negotiated upon which were controversial at the WTO level ) , I felt on balance it was a report to be supported . #% Mr President , you will no doubt recall as vividly as I do the late nights in Luxembourg in June 2001 when we last went through this exercise , followed by the heated third-reading debate in this House shortly thereafter , which was lost by a tie . #% Mr President , I congratulate my colleague Mr Stenmarck on his report . #% I also accepted as a compromise the phasing out of public interventions to support cereal crops . #% . The report on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes is extremely timely given the rapidly declining reserve of fossil fuels . #% This summit also acted decisively to fix the way we protect ourselves against terrorism in Europe . #% We in the Greens deplore the bombing . #% That is why sharing best practice between countries throughout the EU is so vital . #% Maybe I should declare an interest at this point . #% Through the principle of partnership , it is the Member States ' and the Commission 's responsibility to deny any involvement in the structural funds to companies which , having received European Union aid , relocate their activity to another Member State or third country within seven years after the granting of the aid . #% They have all been carried out with vested interests and therefore I think it is appropriate at this time that we have the true picture , the clear picture of what will happen post duty-free . #% It is better for the president of the country and the people of the country . #% The recent reforms undertaken by the Turkish Government represent a real breakthrough and , while no date can be set for Turkey 's accession until the political criteria are met , we will watch with interest the implementation of these reforms . #% It is extremely important that this allegation of abuse of dominant position should be investigated . #% - I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content . #% If the idea is good enough remoteness can often be overcome . #% I also want to thank all colleagues from all political parties , especially in the Committee on Development and Cooperation , related committees and , of course , the secretariats , who were extremely helpful . #% High Representative , you spoke of the Mitchell report and light at the end of the tunnel . #% That would make a lot of sense . #% Amendments were also accepted on including waterway projects and linking the allocation of funds to the reduction of traffic growth and air pollution . #% I was disappointed that after the amendments were rejected , we were unable to pass the final resolution . #% But in reality this is your job , Mr President-in-Office . #% In particular I am pleased that the report stated that the FTA must look at countries ' specific economic and social characteristics to entitle them to protect their most vulnerable economic sectors , such as agriculture and public services . #% Let us make sure that these pledges are honoured -- only two per cent of the USD 1 billion pledged to the reconstruction of the Iranian city of Bam after the earthquake there has been spent . #% It is in the interest of the consumer , but it should also be in the interest of the industry . #% We have already seen some good election results . #% This report addresses the key question of housing . #% That really would help to solve the problems of small businesses and we should look to the very small businesses where real jobs can be created in great numbers . #% But I want to highlight one thing and I hope Commissioner Nielson will take note of this . #% He claimed that the text should have read ` English meat ' instead of ` British meat ' . #% I wonder to what extent the Commissioner feels it is possible to use this particular issue to make progress rapidly to formalize relationships with Cuba . #% Mrs Alvoet came here to Strasbourg on 12 September 2001 to address an intergroup meeting on animal welfare . #% This is very important because it speaks of the need for vigorous debate in the Convention to see whether we can produce a consensus . #% This leads to problems in two areas . #% Even the World Bank and the East European NGO called Bankwatch have publicly stated this view . #% I agree very much with the three points she wanted us to focus on , although on one I take a different view . #% What pressure can the Council bring to bear to end this outrageous use of caged beds ? #% The Commission proposal quite clearly recognises the difference of legal treatment between descending and ascending relatives . #% I wonder whether he saw the Money Programme on BBC 2 on Sunday night - I know he is an avid television watcher in his spare time - which indicated that this practice is not confined to ferry companies alone . #% Mr President , I rise on a point regarding the imposition of the Rule on the 50 % voting on roll-call votes . #% However , I am disappointed that he is so pessimistic , both looking back to the past and forward to the future . #% An amendment by Mr Nisticò is flawed by the fact that it restricts itself to stem cell lines and not to embryos . #% Mr President , it is a great pleasure to speak on Palestine . #% Frankly , if this institution wishes to continue to practise multilingualism - and perhaps that is a debate we should have - there is no alternative but to start recruiting now . #% The President-in-Office made much of the increased efficiency and transparency that Tampere has brought . #% I have looked at the various estimates of what this would cost the industry . #% It has long been a major flaw of the CFP that it has been over-centralised and inflexible . #% We need to encourage NEPAD , especially the conception , growth and sustenance of small - and medium-sized enterprises in Africa , owned and run by Africans using the natural resources of their countries and employing their own people , with the appropriate training and help that we can give them . #% My team -- Scotland -- was in Lithuania recently and I have no doubt a number of friendships were made . #% Turkey must be offered a pre-accession strategy accompanied by more financial support and a friendlier political environment . #% There are many false claims being put forward that multinationals will not advance this competitive market of drugs unless they get this particular protection . #% That regulation could potentially , depending on its implementation , have a disastrous effect on many legitimate Muslim-owned businesses . #% I should like to point out that this is not actually the case . #% Mr President , I join my Scottish colleagues in asking the Commissioner to help us to resolve this situation as urgently as possible . #% in writing . - I voted for the amendment which calls for greater transparency when signing off MEPs ' General Expenditure Allowance . #% It is exactly the same in the committee rooms . #% Salmon accounts for nearly 40 % of Scottish food exports and Atlantic salmon farming is now worth more to the Scottish economy in financial terms than cattle and sheep farming combined . #% At the very least , until such time as the level of competition between the different modes of transport is reflected in the reality of grants and proposed harmonization conditions , these aids are a modest means of providing compensation in the interests of a sustainable transport policy . #% As I understand from your contribution early on , you did mention that you needed this extra power as a legal basis to pay out the EUR 280 million . #% 
The islands have a vast contribution to make and they can make it . #% Why , then , are lifeline ferries being treated differently to trains , trams and metros ? #% Unless the single market can be made to work properly , we will lose that battle . #% Europe can not secure its energy supply , combat climate change or tackle terrorism with a retreat into unilateralism . #% The Council may - and ought to - have influence , but the idea that the presidency will be ` powerful ' is a great mistake . #% I would also like to put on record my thanks to the IMCO Secretariat and to the Belgian Presidency , in particular , to Mr Vertessen and Mr Haerynck for all their dedicated work . #% The report paves the way for decentralisation and the Commission must set out a comprehensive form of zonal management , delivered through zonal management committees . #% We all know that ` one person , one vote ' is absolutely central to the work of this Parliament and I have to say to you , Mr President - and I hope you will listen very carefully - that you are the fifth president of the European Parliament that I have raised this issue with . #% However , there is much more to environmental protection than just technical measures , important as they will always be . #% Here I can not accept the Commissioner 's point of view that we should keep the two matters separate . #% Unfortunately , we have to await the documentation that comes from the Council in all 11 languages of the Community before we actually have Council 's position formally adopted so that we can come to a conclusion with a third reading . #% Solidarity can not mean those governments who have gone through the tough process of reform now having to bail out those who have not . #% To maintain its international prestige and internal effectiveness , its institutions must change with the times . #% However , it is worth noting that the 40 Spanish trawlers fishing in this zone at any given time are all massive 25-metre plus vessels , often twice the size of local Irish boats . #% I salute the efforts of Commissioner Frattini and of the Finnish Presidency in trying to coax and cajole the Member States forward . #% We must guarantee that this proposal , which will last for the next five years , is effective . #% With this and with the development of the social dialogue , which is one of the priorities of the Austrian Presidency , I believe the union movement will go from strength to strength within the European Union . #% I had a great deal to say about Iraq and the Middle East peace process as well , but my time is running short . #% These proposals are designed to ensure a high level of social protection for workers as well as a high degree of safety for passengers . #% A democratically elected Parliament has been abolished and replaced by a new Legislative Council rigged in favour of Beijing and against the free will of the Hong Kong people . #% I think I speak for all the women on this . #% Secondly though , given the debate we have just had , in the context of the current global financial crisis , it sets a very positive example . #% I tend to agree with alternative production , but some of these growers are very small growers indeed . #% I urge you to take this issue very seriously . #% Within the process it is important to involve local communities , and Mrs de Brún 's report highlights the wide range of projects including childcare , after-school projects , enterprise parks and small business enterprise , in both the rural and urban areas . #% I was in Moscow last November with a group from this Parliament which had gone there to evaluate the need for humanitarian aid , and it became obvious that the country is just not able to put itself in order . #% However , my view is that cooperation is the only viable policy option and that isolation will only exacerbate the desperate conditions in Palestine , conditions which give rise to frustrations and violence . #% Mr President , as Vice-President of Parliament responsible for relations with national parliaments , I very much welcome both the tone and the content of Mr Napolitano 's report . #% Mr President , I am most disappointed that the Commissioner simply ignored the very simple question that I put . #% The new Europe , the Europe Berlin envisages , should be one where the Union helps its citizens to grasp the opportunities of globalisation and shows them solidarity in facing new global challenges ; one where democracy has the upper hand , and our values have the final word . #% Given the country 's political and economical weight , the report rightly recommends that the EU spares no effort to progress quickly with the consolidation of the strategic association between the EU and India . #% I hope that has been entered in the record . #% We think we should have progressed much further to open up the European market for all types of international freight . #% Before a vote is even cast in this election , we already know the winner . #% If applied in a timely and gradual manner , liberalisation has the key to unlock commercial potential and stimulate economic growth to the satisfaction of both parties . #% Do they not take advice from their own scientists ? #% A strong budget : yes , absolutely ; fair to old and new Member States : so many Members raised that as an issue , and it is an issue we need to address . #% Beyond this , I stress the critical importance of research and development and innovation to the future of Europe . #% in writing . - I voted to give discharge to European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working conditions but call on the Foundation to make sure that appropriations are made available only when the corresponding assigned revenue has been received ; notes , in fact , that the Court of Auditors reported that , contrary to its Financial Regulation ( Article 19 ) , the Foundation 's budget did not provide for specific headings for various programmes financed from assigned revenue ; notes , moreover , that under a programme financed by assigned revenue , the Foundation committed EUR 184 000 , although the assigned revenue actually received was only EUR 29 000 . #% Mr President , I am delighted that the UK Government was one of the key supporters of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1185/2003 concerning the disgusting practice of removing shark fins on board vessels . #% It has been changed back to tomorrow ? #% I ask you to carry out the Bureau 's instructions in these matters . #% Mr President , I want to thank my group for giving me the opportunity to speak on their behalf in what is a truly historic occasion . #% I hope implementation of this directive will be fast-tracked in Britain to make it easier for consumers to play their part in reducing energy consumption and tackling climate change . #% This has demonstrated what a positive impact the EU can have . #% This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending . #% - Mr President , Tony Blair and Donald Dewar will not have slept well last night ! #% The Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced similar conflict and almost 2 million civilians have been killed there or are missing over the last two to three years . #% My name appears twice in that list , but Members present will recall that I specifically made a point of order , concerning rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure . #% It shows how supposed safeguards on freedom in Hong Kong are being quickly eroded . #% Current tension between the EU and Iran over the resumption of the Iranian nuclear programme can only be resolved long term by dialogue , and if we seek the position of honest broker then we must endeavour not to avoid double standards in our dealings with Iran . #% The European Parliament therefore agreed at its plenary session in December 2002 that we should immediately re-programme this money to help with the Prestige disaster in Galicia . #% Yet too often , the coalition forces and the struggling Iraqi Government have met violence with blundering violence . #% For example , cars that are safer , more fuel efficient and easier to dismantle after use reduce economic growth in classical terms but create another type of good . #% Our citizens do not want a liberalised water sector . #% The Research Committee 's considered position -- Amendment 10 -- is a position we must support . #% In February 2008 , the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations about Swiss participation in the two programmes . #% Granted , as you say , that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States , nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle . #% They have become scapegoats for the inadequacies of the Libyan health service . #% May I also say to Madam President-in-Office that subsidiarity must be as vitally respected at Tampere as in all aspects of the work of this Union . #% It is not necessarily right that we always depend on the United States to be the world 's policeman . #% So we really have to bring these things together . #% My question to the President is this : is he aware of how unbelievably complicated the scheme is going to be if the decision goes ahead to abolish duty-free sales from 1 July ? #% The British ban on meat on the bone is stupid and unnecessary and should be lifted . #% It might not have been ` the Full Monty ' that we would ask for in the UK but at least it is something . #% We also have to deliver proper implementation of European legislation , letting our citizens know what needs to be done , and Member States have to live up to their promises of economic reform so that we can give the green light to Lisbon . #% 
We need to develop a common platform . #% Amendment 36 to 43 clarify the rule of the agency in implementing these joint deployment plans and they also give an appropriate role to Regional Advisory Councils . #% Firstly , as you have indicated , it is a win-win deal for Korea and for the European Union economies . #% It offers the promise to our continental colleagues of a less perfidious albion . #% The proposal aims at ensuring an exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic , environmental and social conditions . #% We came to good conclusions about the need to sustain structural funding at European level and to take seriously the problems of territorial cohesion and permanent geographical disadvantage . #% Looking at the cases as clearly and candidly as possible , it seems to me that Mr Speroni 's was one where because matters were asked concerning an explanation of votes in the House he was clearly being called to account for an opinion expressed in the exercise of his functions . #% - My vote in this matter is in support of the need to ensure that the European Patent Office improves its procedures to prevent any patent being used in human cloning . #% The other problem we have with biofuels is that while we are getting cars produced that can take biofuels and getting drivers willing to drive the cars , there is still a great difficulty in most parts of Europe in finding petrol stations that will stock biofuels and enable the consumer to take advantage of this ecologically friendly system . #% Madam President , few reports have been the subject of such intensive lobbying by the industry concerned and I think this is always instructive . #% There would certainly be more fairness and less bureaucracy than hitherto . #% I would like to concentrate on the specific programme for science and society , which is essential for re-establishing the necessary level of trust and mutual understanding between the scientific community and civil society at large . #% Developing countries are likely to be the ones who suffer the most . #% We call on the Council to announce that all discussions on lawmaking by codecision will be open to public view . #% Because we should all recognize that there are other countries in the Community that have BSE and for some countries there is no apparent reason for this BSE . #% Following the terror attacks in Istanbul and Madrid , nobody can deny that terrorism today is a serious challenge for Europe . #% Further amendments address the question of Member States ' ability to take action , in relation to their own fleets , which exceeds the minimum required under EU regulation . #% The Irish presidency is right to focus on enlargement . #% If that happens , we are going to be back to square one , with a sectarian government , backed by both al-Hakim and Muqtada al-Sadr at the behest of Tehran , and we will have a destabilised situation where the party who won the election is no longer in government . #% While listening to this debate yet again I am struck by the extent to which it is the wrong question we are asking , and hence coming up with the wrong answer . #% It is very important that the system be simplified and made more accessible for developing countries , particularly the least developed countries . #% Mr President , it is a very important matter that we discuss tonight , as Mr Bolkestein said . #% Of course Syria is involved , and , of course , Syria must be a key player in the eventual solution . #% The Scottish Labour voter - for so long taken for granted - has spoken . #% They will be hotly contested . #% My own country , Scotland , is at the forefront of many aspects of ecological innovation , particularly in the area of renewable energy . #% Certainly not . #% As a policy issue , immigration is simple . #% So `` appropriate '' is the word , rather than `` 10 % '' . #% The directive as currently drafted makes insufficient provision for the transparency of arrangements at airports and consultation of users that we in this House would wish to see . #% You have inherited a House larger by some eight dozen MEPs and richer by nine new official languages . #% I wrote to Mrs Aelvoet on 13 June 2001 - and that letter was signed by 20 Members of this House - requesting a meeting with her to raise the question of the fraudulent importation of cat and dog fur products into the EU from Asia and China . #% Finally , I support the proposals for consultation , as laid down by the rapporteur . #% The scale of this phenomenon is impressive , but certainly not known in full . #% Mr President , regarding the Minutes on my speech yesterday , I want to raise a point . #% It would be perverse and severely damaging if Parliament , led by the Green brigade who , sadly , know so little of the real world were to remove the ` sufficient ' classification in this new directive and condemn Scotland 's beaches to the loss of their coveted and deserved status among the best and most beautiful in Europe . #% In that light it is absolutely unacceptable that the current policy allows Member States , after submission of region-based plans , to reallocate funds internally yet still formally comply with the additionality principle while defying its spirit . #% These being the charges , the first charge concerning illegal arms trading , etc. , against both Mr Pasqua and Mr Marchiani , the second against Mr Pasqua only , the examining magistrates are requesting the waiver of parliamentary immunity of these two gentlemen , so that certain judicial supervision measures may be taken against them . #% In addition to this , I support the Linguistic requirement that Member States must ensure that air traffic controllers can demonstrate the ability to speak and understand English to a satisfactory standard as a means to the ends above . #% The establishment of the rapid reaction force , the launching of operations in Bosnia , FYROM and the Congo are certainly pluses . #% I welcome this report by my colleague Richard Howitt on Human Rights in the World 2005 . #% Very briefly , firstly , my question was not specifically about recruitment policy but policy towards existing personnel . #% We ignore or side-step it at our peril . #% in writing . - I welcome this report and the support the European Globalisation Fund is giving to workers made redundant . #% If those issues are tackled , aquaculture can provide , as I said earlier , a good source of good food for our population as well as creating jobs . #% They have lost control of the industry upstream , where the feedstuffs manufacturers are concerned , and they have lost control of the industry downstream to the large food chains . #% The second is negligence by the French Government for failing to uphold the fundamental Treaty provisions on free movement . #% I would like to praise also the enormous courage of Mr Cook 's counterpart in government , Mo Mowlam , for her very brave actions with regard to Northern Ireland . #% However , evidently , as the horrifying events in Mumbai show us , all is not well in India . #% The report will assist with the simplification of regulations concerning social security schemes across the EU . #% When is a decline in deficit substantial ? #% Without this European action which is so urgently required , experts predict that quite possibly there could be one air accident a week . #% Their patent is in any case irrelevant after seven or ten years as new drugs are developed and doctors will change a treatment regime , thereby precipitating the fall in price of that medicine still under patent . #% It is now our duty to see that these matters are honed and perfected as they come into operation . #% I must strongly support the rapporteur and his suggestions that the Commission should be tackling the issues of major topics , such as the importance and the overall impact of the programme in relation to the agreed objectives rather than individual programmes . #% in writing . - I support this proposal on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments , with a view to closing existing loopholes and eliminating tax evasion . #% For the first time in eighteen years we now have a Labour government in Britain . #% Whilst I do believe that the Council has a duty to listen to the views of this House , the EU 's only directly elected institution , I do not believe that VAT systems should be harmonised . #% Surely indeed , this Union must recognise subsidiarity in a generous and broad sense , it must acknowledge the political and national diversity of the European Union and the debate on the future must take full account of the powers of the internal political units of the Member States , not only of the Member States themselves . #% The Striffler reports underlines some of these concerns and it is to be hoped that positive action results from today 's vote . #% Already 80 000 people are dead and 3 million people are homeless . #% The advantage of assisted voluntary return is that it permits return in a non-punitive and a cost-effective way . #% Nevertheless , I was very grateful to my colleague , Mrs Ahern , also from the committee , for raising some points of continuing concern tonight and I would like to thank again the rapporteur for the device whereby she has introduced in an addendum to the resolution the points about the intermediate service providers and codes of conduct . #% There is no reason why counterfeiting of medicines and their distribution within or across borders should not constitute a criminal offence in international law . #% However , I am sceptical about this being achieved in my own Member State under the current government . #% Commissioner , would I be mistaken in suggesting that perhaps the admirable arrangements at Doha had something to do with the relative success of that meeting compared with previous WTO meetings ? #% 
Regarding paragraph 26 , there is a nuance in the different languages . #% Mr President , I want to raise a point of order on a very serious matter dealing with Scotch whisky . #% Although the report was rejected , I should like to explain why I and my two colleagues from Scotland supported some of the amendments . #% Every week we hear across the EU story after story about this issue . #% That is something that you and your Commissioners will have to earn : every day , every month , brick by brick , in this stronger , closer European Union . #% We must not ask the people of Africa and other poor countries to bear the cost of our justified humanitarian response to the Tsunami victims . #% We need to use the office of the EU facilitator to sort that out , to get an agreement between Eyadema and the opposition parties to take Togo to democracy . #% We also must respond to the call for greater environmental protection by ensuring farmers have an opportunity to participate in agri-environmental schemes with a goal of a majority of farmland being covered by such a scheme over the period of the next reform . #% There is no doubt of course that , in many cases , duty-free affects the cost of airport fares and ferry charges . #% But I welcome the report on behalf of my group and give Mr Katiforis our thanks and support . #% This report is good news for sustainable EU fisheries policy as it recognises the need to make sensitive use of access restrictions . #% We must wake and work and sleep as if that trust must be won anew every day . #% We need to remember that new communication media have in fact liberated interaction between people and ideas and between people and people . #% It saddens me as a proud Scottish European that the UK has represented Scotland so badly during the Presidency , and everything I have heard in this debate confirms my view that the UK has lost friends and influence on our behalf by this wrongheaded stance on the budget . #% There are many Margots in the UK and across the EU with similar stories concerning problems with silicone . #% in writing . - I supported this report which aims to combat discrimination against the Roma people and calls on Member States to produce policies for their integration into the labour market . #% While I believe we can and should go further and I commend the Commissioner for his flexibility , particularly the flexibility he showed in Geneva , this is a flexibility that is sadly lacking in our negotiating and trading partners . #% Mr President , I follow Mrs Attwooll as one of the other Members for Scotland in this House . #% If it does so , the Commission can make a new proposal or table draft legislation . #% So I think you should leave these references in . #% This proposal will have a substantial impact on the European Union 's biotechnology industry , on the EU 's research programme and , in particular , on the priorities of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research . #% Clearly we are disappointed with the development of the single market . #% Could the President-in-Office confirm to the House today that the Presidency is minded to allow a mandate to the Commission to undertake a study of the economic impact and any potential job losses consequent on the current decision that duty-free will cease and excise duties will apply as normal as from 1 July 1999 . #% I say that is another question altogether . #% They are all on the same theme : the need to look at industrial fishing . #% I represent , for example , offshore workers in two very different industries : in fishing and in oil . #% When you talked about inviting the members of the applicant countries ' parliaments to be present at the enlargement debate here , I agreed with you , but my immediate reaction was to wonder where were they going to sit . #% Furthermore , more campaigns should be introduced , with a common EU logo and international help lines , and more information on legal rights to health services for victims in other countries must be provided . #% in writing . - I voted for this report because I believe this is a good time for the Commission 's Green Paper , officially endorsing the economic and social importance of the sector , to prompt discussion on ` unlocking the potential of the cultural and creative industries ' . #% On that account the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed to this House , and the proposal was accepted , that the project be withdrawn for reconsideration by the Commission . #% I am glad to see the report recognises the importance and potential of food signposting systems in place in several Member States . #% The amendments which were approved by the committee - and which I hope will be endorsed by the whole House tomorrow - include two , which simply correct inaccurate references in the Commission 's text . #% First of all , there is the need for the Commission to take a more wide-ranging view of measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted fish stocks , in particular by studying factors other than over-fishing that may cause fish stocks to be depleted , such as pollution and global warming . #% In the field of railways , we would like to see a better development of the European railways . #% In conclusion , health connects with the citizen . #% It is also right that 16 countries should get even better access to our market , through GSP + , in return for setting up and implementing 27 specified international conventions on human rights , co-labour standards , sustainable development and good governance . #% The only way to gain the confidence of consumers is to offer a totally traceable , transparent and reliable information system . #% The instructions from the Bureau say that you will make it known at the vote . #% Mr President , I will be no exception in this debate in offering my own congratulations to our rapporteur and indeed the shadow rapporteurs . #% I think two proposals relating to the calendar gave us an opportunity to improve both our working methods and our contact with the citizens . #% Perhaps you could ask you services to check whether this is a record . #% So I want Parliament to rethink the 35 language posts . #% The increase in overseas development aid to an EU average of 0.39 % of gross national income is a positive step . #% Moreover , it should not be thought that this is the only basis upon which people who are injured can be helped . #% We say today ` au revoir ' with a vote of thanks and our best wishes for the future . #% Turning to the report on excise duty which is in front of us , one of the problems that a report like this highlights is that much of the decision-making within the EU is surrounded by secrecy , which , I am sure , a lot of citizens are very worried about . #% The presidency also rightly focuses , too , on the Lisbon Agenda in what can only be called its hour of need . #% I belong to a growing minority in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party and also in this House which believes a radical change to our approach may be needed . #% The Rules of Parliament are quite clear that Parliament must issue its amendments and its reports in the languages of the Members present . #% In the meantime , can she give us an assurance that the single farm payments that are going to come about as a result of decoupling , and which we know will have an environmental element , will have a strong tree-planting element as well ? #% We have had the great pleasure of debating with one of the more assiduous and intelligent European Affairs Ministers who has come before this House . #% Transposition , however , is years behind . #% The health of a society is judged not only by its practices but also by the direction in which its face is set and my committee believes that the Commission 's policy is taking us in the right direction even if we seek greater clarity in the rights of some of those to whom it is directed . #% I welcome here the fact that for the first time JAA is to centralize all information relating to ramp checks , specific conditions under which ramp checks must be carried out and set down in specific EU measures for action to ensure that these standards are applied . #% The Scottish Parliament agreed to ask for legal advice on this . #% This Summit has paid no more than lip-service to this commitment . #% I have to ask my colleagues and all the other Groups who agreed through their coordinators in committee that we reject this proposal from the Verts/ALE Group and that we have the final vote tomorrow . #% Let me turn to a separate issue , which is the resolution . #% in writing . - I have become increasingly concerned by the rise of racism and xenophobia across the EU , both in new Member States and established Member States . #% Firstly , we think it is bad for the World Trade talks because it undermines the seriousness of our commitment to a genuine reform of the world system . #% Without that our Community and our Union lack the clarity of purpose which will make them not merely acceptable to , but embraced by , the citizens . #% I supported the resolution on Estonia , which showed solidarity with the country in the face of interference by the Russian authorities in the internal affairs of Estonia . #% Mr Solana , Liberals and Democrats object to Parliament 's views being ignored or disregarded on matters of global importance . #% in writing . - I voted for discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009 . #% Madam President , I am sure that Mr Corbett did not intend to misrepresent my position , but he accidentally did . #% On that account I did not vote for it . #% 
Making peace also requires a strong , functioning and accountable Palestinian Authority . #% Europe has the potential to be a beacon of hope , a model of tolerance , diversity and stability , in a world where these attributes are still rare . #% I also submitted an amendment urging the Commission to liaise with the international Fair Trade movement in supporting clear and widely-applicable criteria against which consumer assurance schemes can be assessed , so as to support consumer confidence in such schemes . #% In the case of Scotland 's Western and Northern Isles , two or three ferry crossings may be required before reaching Scotland 's mainland , often landing in areas very remote from the ultimate destination . #% In vulnerable regions such as the Amazon , Central Africa , South-East Asia and Russia more than half of the logging activities are illegal . #% in writing . - This report deals with important issues relating to fraud , including in the field of greenhouse gas emissions . #% Madam President , I am looking forward to your report because the occupant of 424 is involved in the implications of your report . #% First of all , it is obvious that criminal law and criminal sanctions touch the liberty of citizens more closely than any other branch of the law and therefore , being absolutely certain that there is a valid constitutional basis for the use of criminal law is vital to liberty as a fundamental matter of the rule of law . #% We are in favour of Mrs Hautala 's code of conduct for multinationals and we know that multinationals when they move into areas like mine sometimes do not stay . #% It moves the EU beyond the current stalemate at the WTO regarding the granting of ` compulsory licences ' to pharmaceutical products to combat diseases which afflict millions of people in the developing world . #% The rapporteur gives me no option but to disagree with him . #% It is not only a question of our legal and humanitarian obligations but also a question of economic and administrative common sense . #% Only within the last couple of months scientists in Germany have discovered a strange strain in salmon . #% That is why it is right that there should be a reinforced monitoring system to ensure that countries fulfil their commitments . #% Could you please confirm that this will be translated as ` public interest ' ? #% That is what I hope we will continue to do until such time as this House begins to grasp some sense of reality and reverts back to some normality . #% Because Mr Fischler is here , I would like to say that EU agricultural subsidies are killing the poor farmers in the Third World . #% But we can not share Mr Linkohr 's enthusiasm for harmonising tax rates and using harmonised tax , applied at European level , and the manipulation of strategic oil reserves to regulate oil prices . #% There are indeed legitimate concerns over maritime safety and the danger of pollution , not just at sea , but also of the air and of groundwater , in the busy , heavily-populated industrial area in which Gibraltar and its Spanish hinterland are found . #% The final package must guarantee that new Member States will not be net contributors before 2007 . #% I welcome this proposal , which makes progress towards a Europe-wide system of re-insurance provision and regulation , as well as providing an opportunity to tackle the situation in the USA , where vast amounts of capital are tied up because of their collateral requirement leading to extra costs currently being passed on to consumers . #% When I first stood for the European Parliament in 1984 , I remarked to one of my then colleagues , Ken Collins , a Scottish Member , that I was wondering whether I was doing the wrong thing , because Parliament did not seem to have much teeth when it came to legislative matters . #% According to the official website of the Copenhagen Summit , Scotland has taken on ` world leadership on climate protection ' . #% We must set up this European air transport safety organization with proper safety checks at all European airports to ensure the safety of those European passengers using those carriers and those European residents near Community airports receiving them . #% In particular , does he accept that technical measures , if they are to be meaningful , must be tailored to regions , and that therefore there is a regional aspect . #% It is perfectly possible for the Commission to act as if the protocol were in force from this afternoon . #% While I am pleased to hear assurances that individuals will not be criminalised for personal use , and that the ACTA Agreement will not be used to prevent generic medicines reaching developing countries , I hope the Parliament will be able to access all documents and monitor the negotiations to ensure this is upheld . #% I was unable to support it because , as a response to a Commission Green Paper , it ruled out far too many options for the future of an EU contract law and neglected a duty to request an impact assessment on the full costs and implications of each of the Commission 's options . #% With regard to the Commissioner 's point on Member State responsibility , I realise that he had difficulties over the last few months negotiating with the Council on this point and that it has not been easy . #% The time has come for diplomacy , delicate but determined . #% Mr President , I agree with what my friend and colleague , Mr Miller , was just saying . #% So sell that to your people , instead of sidestepping the issues . #% The disparities between countries show that some Member States provide up to three times as much state aid as others . #% It sets out objectives for : expenditure , rules for eligibility of expenditure , the level of the Commission contribution and control measures . #% They are allowed to organize and demonstrate . #% As these commercial vehicles go round roundabouts the fuel tends to spill out and motorbikes following closely behind skid on the greasy surface that diesel leaves . #% in writing . - I voted for this report on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement . #% The time for specific rates , for specific figures , will be when the Commission produces its follow-up report to this one . #% This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system . #% in writing . - I support this report , which draws on the instrument 's performance , scrutiny and promoting better use of development money in the future . #% Finally we have to examine the welfare of the fish actually farmed in the fish farms . #% These outstanding results are obtained mainly through a system of independent observers on board , which is the only system that guarantees the coverage of 100 % of the fishing trips by large tuna purse seiners in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and a set of stringent technical and operative requirements . #% Because they can not use Smoltine , which deals with transferring the fish from fresh water to salt water , they have to use hydrogen peroxide , which is very costly and has very serious effects on the life of the fish . #% Developing countries must be encouraged to use funds saved from debt repayments to finance core services such as health and education without which it will be practically impossible to achieve the Millennium Development Goals . #% Any strategy must ensure that aquaculture is sustainable , competitive and economically viable as an activity , taking into account environmental and social concerns - including the need to prevent escapes and to have a sustainable means of feeding farmed fish - so that a high-quality , safe product is ensured . #% Mr President , clearly new Labour are trying to write me out of the pages of history in the cultural debate . #% The Erika oil spill is one of a catalogue of disasters that have taken place in recent years in Community waters , including the Braer spill off Shetland and the Sea Empress off Wales . #% I understand what you are doing and I have confidence in it . #% I commend every mechanism within this resolution to the House and I hope to hear from the Commissioner that the Commission will continue to support us in this aim . #% It now seems almost certain that infected catering waste was delivered to a farm in the north-east of England , which for whatever reason , was not properly treated , or perhaps was not treated at all . #% Accordingly , I supported this report . #% Nothing needed to change from the status quo . #% -- In this question on openness and transparency I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer . #% I support what the Commissioner has said on the information communication policy , which is laid out as a very clear and coherent attempt to communicate better with Europe 's citizens . #% And will Paris and The Hague show leadership of their people ? #% By any objective standards our Union is a great success . #% Mr President , the more we look into the subject of traditional herbal medicines the more I am convinced that there is urgent need for action . #% So it is only fairly recently that there has been across the Union experience of the working of the product liability regime , which of course is not absolutely uniform in any event across the countries , because there are areas where different views may be taken consistent with the directive . #% Only yesterday in this House we passed a resolution giving the European Parliament 's opinion on the third round of negotiations for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control . #% As he said , fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years , the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend . #% I notice from the Minutes that Mr Tomlinson spoke in the next debate and he is still here , but he was speaking as President-in-Office of the Council , not as a Member . #% I appreciate that there are some concerns in this House - and specifically in the Committee on Fisheries - about the potential impact of Papua New Guinea 's tuna imports on the EU industry . #% Nor should we overlook the potential of our indigenous oilfields , notably those in my Scottish constituency . #% I am pleased that the UK Government has stated categorically that it will cooperate fully with the Council of Europe investigation . #% That is something we would do very well . #% Mr Fischler , regrettably , was also unsympathetic , apparently saying that fisheries , unlike the agriculture sector , could easily respond to the fuel price increases by increasing fish prices . #% 
My interest is in the practical way in which the scheme will operate . #% So much has been agreed on the complex , technical issues that it would surely be a shame -- in fact , an absurd embarrassment -- not to close the remaining gap . #% It is high time that we moved away from that . #% I hope that you will support my call for a United Nations committee to review it , to determine whether further changes are needed concerning armed insurgents and terrorists who do not fall within the traditional definitions and , if not , at least call on the Americans to sign the 1977 amendments to extend protection to guerrillas and combatants , amendments which the US has refused thus far to sign . #% In France , CCTV cameras cover the public transport system . #% Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position . #% Has there been any follow-up on what measures the presidency is going to take to ensure that there will be no recurrences of this ? #% The key step forward for Parliament which is possible now as an outcome of negotiations with the Council and the Commission , is that Parliament will be able to block the adoption of ` quasi-legislative ' implementing measures to which it objects . #% Mr President , the war with Iraq inevitably overshadowed the Council 's important economic reform agenda . #% I thought that part of the amendment was very valuable although there were other aspects of it which I could not support . #% As Members of the House will know , the bloc exemption creates exemptions from normal competition law , of the kind Mr Langen mentioned , in relation to the calculation of premiums where net premiums may be jointly calculated by insurers . #% In similar vein , its Amendment 19 to Article 2 ( 1 ) , proposes to delete the limiting phrase ` for application to the human body ' , thus opening the directive 's full provisions to in vitro research in laboratories , or even school rooms , where no application to the human body is involved . #% I want to draw attention particularly to Amendment No 138 , in its interaction with paragraph 32 of the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report . #% Mr President , Mauritania is a vast country and almost 90 % of its land is desert . #% However , it also acknowledges the need for tight control and monitoring , and I was therefore able to vote for it . #% Would the President-in-Office not agree with me that a single market in the European Union , in which goods , people , services and capital can move as freely across European borders as they do within Member States , is a vital policy objective ? #% I propose , and my Group proposes through amendments to the Fourçans and Randzio-Plath reports , the establishment of an independent organization which would bring together academics , industry practitioners , Commission officials and national government officials in a wider and informal context to discuss different VAT practices and to build a consensus on this . #% One of these industries is naval shipyards . #% The resolution also calls for the allocation of an additional EUR 150 million to compensate fishers , processors and ancillary workers affected by these conservation measures . #% I support this report which urges Member States to take specific measures to encourage and promote women to further their careers where they are under represented . #% So in order to clear up the cloud that could hang over the Commission in this matter , I think there is a case for further consideration , separately from the Fisheries Committee 's consideration of the substance of the proposals . #% President-in-Office , you are right to place an emphasis on Africa - discovered , exploited and then abandoned by Europeans . #% It would be too easy to conclude that the victory for the anti-European parties is confirmation that we got it wrong , but we need the Prime Ministers of those two countries to come here to explain to us how they see the way forward . #% Madam President , I too apologise to the President-in-Office and the Commissioner , but I must leave the debates , since I must chair a meeting of my party . #% Genocide in any country is evil and must be condemned without reservation . #% I believe that share fishermen must continue to be regarded as a special case and not subjected to impractical regulations . #% As with the Northern Ireland peace process , which is not identical but offers some important lessons for conflict resolution , it is occasionally necessary for politicians to take a risk for peace . #% I do not want to waste Parliament ' s time and I thank the President for giving me the opportunity to speak on this subject . #% I am a little worried that the British Government may be leant on by the Americans . #% That is why we call for the Commission to have the power to issue early warnings against countries which are breaching the rules , whether Finance Ministers agree or not . #% The world needs global mechanisms to create consensus on these matters . #% I , therefore , would ask and request that this House support Amendment No 4 . #% You have to realize that while both the public and the private have advantages and good qualities , there has to be a recognition of the social element . #% No discrimination at the workplace would be a good start . #% Mr President , when we discuss the excellent reports by my colleagues Mr Varela , Mr Cunha , Mr Poignant and Mr Gallagher , it is against a background of crisis in the EU fisheries sector . #% Is it not better that these be made available for research purposes , with parental permission , rather than they be uselessly destroyed ? #% My group will have a free vote on it and I believe others will as well . #% They create employment , wealth and security for the local community . #% My Amendment No 1 addresses this problem and I have inserted the word `` review '' to replace the word `` reduce '' , in order to cooperate with colleagues concerned about this issue . #% As a major US intelligence investigation recently disclosed , there is no justification for keeping the name of the Mujahedin on the EU terror list . #% One particular risk that it gives rise to is that a particular asset currently in the hands of EU-owned salmon breeders is the genetic data and genotyped brood stock , which is of fundamental importance , as I am sure the Commissioner well realises . #% I am unable to go along with the rejection of the ` Belgium compromise ' amendment that would have allowed national income tax on an MEP 's salary , and the rejection of a strong statement on a revised and transparent expenses system . #% I hope we will be able to prove to you through our work in the body that will draw up the Charter of Fundamental Human and Social Rights that the presidency and Parliament can work very well together . #% There is a lot of potential there , but it can also mislead consumers because of accidental contamination . #% This will be a great thing for many of us in this House and certainly for Mr Miller and myself who represent Scotland here . #% This report reduces CO2 emissions through new standards which tyres must reach , which will improve fuel efficiency and cut fuel bills . #% in writing . - I voted against this resolution because I do not believe the EU should increase subsidies for the European fisheries sector or any other sector on the basis of a rise in oil prices . #% When Greenland won significant home-rule and decided to opt out of the EC , they had to negotiate their exit . #% Their votes will bring to bear the very changes they most fear . #% I drew attention yet again to the problem of foreign language lecturers in Italian universities whose rights have been denied despite three judgments at the highest level in Europe . #% If we do not satisfy these we let ourselves down in the face of our own aspirations . #% Post office outlets in Scotland , as we have heard , handle much more than just mail delivery . #% But I would nonetheless urge you in your intervention at the European Council in Barcelona to make the point very strongly that we as a House are not happy with the procedure that has been taken and that we hope in the future to see a much more constructive and collaborative approach to us from the other institutions . #% I would also appeal to the President-in-Office to make every effort to conclude three important proposals concerning third-country nationals who are long-term residents , minimum standards for qualifying for refugee status and minimum standards for the granting of such status . #% I wholeheartedly endorse the recommendations in this report and am happy to support it today . #% I totally agree that when needed for repair , unhindered copying of designs of spare parts on payment of remuneration represents a reasonable compromise . #% Only by rapidly improving living standards , particularly in health , education and employment , will stability remain . #% I wish to know what on earth we can say to satisfy our public critics , because - sadly , perhaps - the fattest file a constituency MP gets is about the welfare of animals . #% What I was not clear about was when he talked about other measures where it was necessary to make the single market work . #% The political consensus which has been reached on both sides is an understandable political choice in the face of the worldwide challenges of the 21st century . #% Mr President , nobody needs to tell the Commissioner that we in this Parliament listen as closely to him as he listens to us . #% During the voting at lunchtime , one of the Members of this House claimed that during the translation of certain amendments one of the amendments had been incorrectly translated into English from the original version in French . #% I should also like to mention our sense - like yours - that the ordinary citizens need to see an increase in the speed and efficiency of infringement proceedings against defaulting Member States where the rights of European Union citizens exercised within the internal market are impinged upon or denied . #% But I am happy to say there is an exemption for part of the procedural arrangements . #% As ` Mr Euro ' , it is your right and duty to speak out for the euro and the euro zone . #% The Egyptians have always believed that they have a major role to play in the Middle East and I would encourage them to be full participants in this overall discussion which we must surely try to address from that international perspective . #%
